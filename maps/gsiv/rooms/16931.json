    "Overhead, a gem-inlaid crystal dome allows sunlight to stream in and illuminate the room.  Ivory-cushioned armchairs are scattered in conversational groups.  Centered on the polished marble floor is a crimson-bordered ivory rug.  Tall, silver candelabrum rest on each end of the long, carved rosewood buffet table against the north wall.  A strikingly lifelike mural adorns the walls, seamlessly incorporating an elegant marble archway and some sliding maoral doors into the scene.",
