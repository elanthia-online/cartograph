    "Bursts of hot gas, disturbed in their upward flight by the outcropping just beneath you, have charred a shallow indentation in the stone.  It's just enough room to squeeze into, although it takes quite a bit of squirming to keep from sliding off into the abyss.  Someone has carved a message near the base, but it is difficult to make out the charred letters."
