    "Faint light from outside barely shines through thick opaque windows set high into a wall, casting shadows into a corner.  Hanging brass lanterns emit a soft glow, distributing additional light throughout the office.  A great ebony desk stretches between a lacquered bookshelf and a tall brass-trimmed door.  Two cushioned armchairs rest in the center of the room and a massive woven tapestry covers an entire wall."
