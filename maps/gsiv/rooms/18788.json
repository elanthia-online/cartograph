    "A glaesine-topped wyrmwood workbench dominates the cramped laboratory, one end pushed against the wall so it is beneath a triangular window.  Atop the window-side of the workbench rests a complicated, mithril gem lens assembly.  A glass alembic and a rose-carved, lavender marble crucible also congregate on the workbench.  Scorch marks mar the white marble floors, and a curtained arch leads southeast to the main hallway.  Basking in starlight, a potted black nightshade sits in the lone, unscorched corner.",
