    "[Warcamp, Entrance]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The entrance to the warcamp consists of nothing more than a large gap in a wall built of broken trees and shrubs haphazardly stacked upon the other.  In the turned up earth by the entryway, a bloody child-sized hand reaches up toward the sky, a forgotten or discarded prize of the Grimswarm.  Inside the entrance, the path separates into three directions, wrapping around several poorly constructed huts.  To the south, a path leads to a small rise in land, blanketed in a haze of campfire smoke."
