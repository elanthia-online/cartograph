    "Gaily decorated wagons tilt to one side or the other within the uneven ruts on the muddy pathway.  Banners proclaim the wonder of goods sold within, and several have floral arrangements and streamers of ribbons wound around their beckoning entrances.  Towering past the tops of all nearby tents and wagons looms a tall bell-topped pole marked incrementally in black paint.  A large wooden-hafted mallet rests against the pole, with a burly muscular huckster looking on.",

Banners proclaim the wonder of goods sold within, and several have floral arrangements and streamers of ribbons wound around their beckoning entrances.  Jutting out from the soft ground are some pallid grey fungi."
