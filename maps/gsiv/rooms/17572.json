    "Buckets float in the air several feet above the blue ceramic tiling, their weights supported by twisted ropes attached to the canvas ceiling.  Hanging several feet higher, papier-mache fish swim through the air via nearly indiscernible wires tied to the ceiling.  Creating an ocean of color, the white canvas walls are accented by intermittent wavy stripes of the various shades of blue dyes bordered by thickly painted black lines."
