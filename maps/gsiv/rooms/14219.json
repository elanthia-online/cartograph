    "Parallel rows of benches face a large pool edged in white stone.  The pool's design is graceful and pleasing to the eye.  Marble steps surround it, offering different views of its eloquent nuances.  On the armrest of each bench is carved a sphere, the deft carvings accented in gold leaf.  Overhead, on the high, arched ceiling, the image of an ebon drake spreads its wings.  At each corner of the chamber rests a globe astride a carved marble column."
