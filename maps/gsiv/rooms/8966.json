    "The alley is narrow and the tall buildings crowded along its length almost seem to meet overhead.  Rough paving stones demand attention lest they claim a stubbed toe, and a gully runs down the center of the lane.  The smell of pastries baking hangs in the still, cold air, protected from the gusting wind by the alley's cozy enclosure."
