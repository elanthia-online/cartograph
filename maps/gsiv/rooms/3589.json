  "description": [
    "The alcove has a lofty, arched ceiling, yet the vast expanses of the rooms around it tend to dwarf it in comparison.  A stone slab rises out of the floor to the height of a giantman's brow.  Its surface is smooth and polished, and fine veins of ora run through the rock lengthwise, striping the slab's sides."
