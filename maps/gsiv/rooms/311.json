    "A few scraggly trees cast dark shadows over this clearing at the center of an assortment of ramshackle huts.  Although the area seems dark and deserted, occasional movements in the windows of the huts indicate that the road may not be unobserved.  Small footpaths lead in several directions.  The hut closest to the street seems to be built largely of broken crates.",
