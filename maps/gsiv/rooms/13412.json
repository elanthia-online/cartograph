    "A variety of wicker baskets hang from the ceiling, each housing a spectacular array of bright, colorful flowers in different stages of growth.  The pleasant, mingling scent of all the flowers drifts through the area slowly, while a few white chairs with small tables line the western wall.  A small counter stands to the north, guarding the rows of shelves that house hundreds of baskets."
