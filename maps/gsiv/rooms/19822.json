    "The rows of thin, arched windows set high into the walls cast slices of pale illumination onto the polished marble floor.  Four small ivory fountains are set into the walls, their sparkling waters lending a soft, trickling echo to the surroundings.  Black banners bearing the phases of Liabo line the gaps between the windows, the pristine white moon softly glowing with the reflected moonlight."
