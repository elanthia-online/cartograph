    "A natural spring bubbles up into a stone-edged basin in the floor, bringing both moisture and a balmy chill that is somehow more biting than that of the stone.  On iron brackets, a small shelf is mounted to the wall and draped with a sash of indigo elesine, and atop it are a variety of tools and implements with any number of purposes.  Beneath the shelf is a chest, scarred and aged, and a pickaxe propped against the wall behind it."
