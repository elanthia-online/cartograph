The store of weapons must have once been fine, but the weapons remaining are ruined, and some of them melted by great heat.  Spear shafts that survived the touch of fire have warped and splintered, and the blades of glaives and broadswords are pitted and rusted badly.  An open arch leads to the hold to the southeast."
