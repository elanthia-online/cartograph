    "The acute slant of the deck makes for treacherous footing in the dark and narrow passageway.  The woodwork is bleached almost white from the use of harsh soap, the smell of which competes with the odor of sawdust and the spicy smell of sausages.  A small hatch leads up.  A companionway ladder leads down."
