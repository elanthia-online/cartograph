    "Rose quartz flows across the ceiling, dripping down to the floor in huge pink columns that look almost liquid.  Olivine carpets the floor like fresh grass, crunching under your feet as you cross the room.  You hear a dripping in the distance, but with all the echoes you can't tell which direction it's coming from."
