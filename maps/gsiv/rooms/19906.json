    "The underbrush thins as the canopy of branches above grows thicker.  The trail bends along a sloping hillside, and you can hear the faint trickling of a stream somewhere nearby.  A carpet of leaves covers the dark soil of the forest floor, and squirrels scurry about, digging through the debris for acorns before rushing back up into the oaks."
