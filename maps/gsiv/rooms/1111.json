  "description": [
    "Deep rivulets cut in the surface of this small plain indicate the beginnings of a watercourse, converging to the northwest.  Patches of hardy weeds and small scrub bushes dot the plain, taking in what moisture they can find and surviving valiantly against the drying wind.  The wind varies in intensity, maintaining a mild, comfortably warm breeze but occasionally speeding up until it is hurling abrasive sand at anything foolish enough to stand in the way."
