    "Sloping slightly to the west, the floor here lacks the pooling water of other areas.  The northern wall is imbedded with a series of hooks in parallel rows while the eastern wall is entirely covered with improvised shelving.  A collection of old iron trunks is scattered across the room seemingly haphazardly."
