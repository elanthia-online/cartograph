    "A gold-striped crimson canvas awning, supported by a pair of thin steel poles, stretches from the roof of the wagon, bathing the rocky floor in cool shadow.  Several wooden crates are stacked to one side of a small wooden hatch.  At the edge of the awning stands a tiny portable forge with an iron anvil and a low worktable nearby.",
