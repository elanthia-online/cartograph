    "Short worktables are arranged in rows around the edge of the platform, allowing the center to be kept wide and open for foot traffic as costumers and workers travel between the steps leading to the dyeing room and the colorful bannered corridor that leads into the main shop.  Mannequins fitted with beautiful wings of silver wire and gaily painted gossamer silk are draped in layers of fabric."
