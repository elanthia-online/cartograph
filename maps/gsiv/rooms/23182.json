  "description": [
    "Purple walls display a variety of white-framed child's drawings done in a multitude of mediums.  A white wicker rocking chair rests in the corner beside a small driftwood bed.  The floor is covered with a plush lilac rug and a fine layer of sand.  Bookshelves on one wall hold several children's books and a handful of colorful shell and sea glass knick-knacks, while a copious oak treasure chest overflowing with toys sits beside a purple oak door."
