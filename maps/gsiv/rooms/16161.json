    "A constant stream of recruits, scouts, and messengers flows in and out of the room, creating an air of hectic business.  The taskmaster stands in the center of the room, a conductor to the organized chaos, issuing orders and directing assistants to continually alter a large map set on the wall.  Beneath the map is a pigeon hole cabinet filled with scrolls of paper."
