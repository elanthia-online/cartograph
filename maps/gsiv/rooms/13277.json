    "The hardwood floor is covered with a comfortable, rough-woven carpet, just perfect for lounging on.  Several bright banners hang from the vaulted ceiling, each advertising various famous gatherings and festivals that have been held throughout the lands.  Sitting on the mantel of the large marble hearth is a battered begging bowl, cracked and worn yet sitting in a place of honor."
