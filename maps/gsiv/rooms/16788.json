  "description": [
    "The deep red marble which forms these chambers has a wonderful visual depth to it, created by the commingled tones of crimson and rusty brown which dapple the stone in a variety of patterns.  Some areas give the impression of newly-dissected flesh, while others remind you of smoldering embers."
