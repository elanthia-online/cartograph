  "description": [
    "Looking to the northwest you see the castle's keep rising high above the walls of the inner ward.  Sitting at the base of the granite inner walls is an old hay wagon with a broken axle.  You notice several arrow shafts imbedded in the old buckboard's sides, giving it the look of a monstrous wooden porcupine."
