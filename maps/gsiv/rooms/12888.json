    "At the center of a small clearing stands a single apple tree.  Its limbs reach out to cover an odd collection of items arranged in concentric circles around its roots.  A pile of apples lies at the base of the tree, with every variety of fruit represented in the diverse collection.  In a thick band around the apples is a narrow pile of weapons, surrounded by a large pile of rocks.  Circling the rocks is a narrow band of jewelry, and around this is a deep pile of silver coins.  Rising high at the edge of the clearing is a model of the Ebon Gate, with some thick grey smoke rolling behind it."
