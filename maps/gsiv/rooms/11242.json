    "This quiet room is paneled in dark maoral wood.  Tiny holes, evidence of a thriving insect population, cover the paneling.  Shelves of books line two of the walls.  A shallow nook is filled with a maoral scroll cupboard.  A large desk fills one corner.  Diffused light enters through a dusty window."
