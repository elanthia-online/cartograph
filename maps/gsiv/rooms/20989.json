    "White walls surround this small room, broken only by an airily curtained window with a view of the jungle foliage, and a curved white arch leading back to the landing.  Potted tropical flowers lend their scents to the room, their petals vividly colorful against the pale flooring.  Taking up much of the floor space are a set of circular racks that houses a wide range of clothing.  A white marble counter near the back of the room displays an ornate jewelry box on its surface, while a young woman stands behind it, waiting to serve any interested patrons."
