  "description": [
    "The deck above forms a low ceiling, but the room is comfortable for those who don't have to duck.  A dozen sewing tables are set about the room, occupied by halflings busily accepting patterns from the salesclerks and sewing clothing, their small fingers moving faster than the eye can follow."
