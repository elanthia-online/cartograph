    "The crowds thicken as they push deeper into town.  To the southwest, you notice the outline of a dock against the waters of the bay.  Eastward, you can see wagons trundling down the street towards the cliffs.  Nearby, a lone fisherman stands poised on the rocks, casting his line into the sea."
