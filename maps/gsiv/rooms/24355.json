    "Several windows line this wagon, their panes covered in what appears to be dried, cracked mud.  Dull silver sconces hang from the walls, the candles in their grips emitting faint light and a musk-like scent.  Centered between the doorways on the far sides of the wagon is a delicately carved hazelnut table.  A long hazelnut shelf is nestled against one wall next to a brass rack, above which hang a cluster of spiderwebs."
