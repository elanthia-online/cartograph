    "The roughly cut stone walls provide shelter from the city streets below.  Yet leaning over you can still see the daily mayhem which goes on in even the quietest neighborhoods.  The grunt and strain of trainees and their masters can be heard over the length of the roof and mixes with the crowds below."
