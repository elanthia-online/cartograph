    "[Suffering Shawm Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A long table dominates the center of the tavern.  Shaped from tan marble and mounted on two short, white marble pedestals, the table appears as a rounded rod that suddenly flares widely at one end while tapering to a point at the other.  The top portion has been flattened to keep plates and mugs from sliding off, however the overall impression is one of a long wind instrument suitable for a person of immense stature.  Several chairs surround the table."
