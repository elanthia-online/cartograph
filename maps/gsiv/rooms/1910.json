    "Tinkling a cheerful melody, a spring bubbles up in a fountain, creating a small stream that heads off to the northwest, burbling happily.  Strung between a pair of sturdy stalactites, a windchime rings as a breeze blows through the wide tunnel.  A low, decorative fence splits the divide between the tiny channel and the street it parallels."
