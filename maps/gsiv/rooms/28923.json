  "description": [
    "Towering frames hang over the southern precipice, where a large platform is surrounded by rollways of various timber logs.  Larger steel cables fitted with bardon hooks allow an assembly of workers to slowly lower each mammoth piece into the ocean below.  A secondary workstation is setup beneath a small awning, the workers within using barking irons to remove the barks and limbs of each log."
