    "Wet and dry merge here, where black sand beach and pebbled berm meet.  Digging holes exist on each side of this natural line, some filled with water post abandonment and others still mostly dry, often occupied by those seeking treasure.  Small iron torch holds set beside each depression steady rag-wrapped wood, lit and flickering in the breezy night air.",
