    "The narrow entrance opens up into a small, dry cavern.  Many niches are carved into the solid rock walls, and stone biers ring the roughly circular floor.  Candles set into elaborate mithril sconces illuminate the area, but the ceiling is high enough to be lost in darkness.  In the center of the cavern is a large stone altar that is chiseled into the shape of an anvil."
