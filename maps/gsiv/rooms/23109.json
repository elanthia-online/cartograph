    "The stench of decay in this area is potent, hanging heavy in the air.  Moonlight shines brightly down from above and through areas of the barn that were never finished.  Tarnished silver tools and a collection of off-white cloths that don't look entirely clean are piled into a trio of buckets located in the center of the area.  Illuminated by a plethora of candles on the ground, dark green moss creeps over the wood, lending it some color.",
