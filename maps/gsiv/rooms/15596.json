    "White silk-paneled walls rise from an intricate patterned floor.  Just above a grey-veined white marble fountain hangs a noble elf maiden portrait, and a silver-hued polished haon ceiling completes the picture.  A plain wooden table and an ora-bound large walnut trunk stand side by side in the middle of the room."
