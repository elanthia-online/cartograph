  "description": [
    "Pines, firs and spruces mix with walnuts, oaks and maples where the conifer forest and deciduous forest collide.  Both leaves and needles blanket the ground, rather heavily, as the road continues its winding ascent to the west and descent to the east.  A soft, warm wind pushes against the hillside, rolling upward and causing the trees to sway gently.  The smell of rain is in the air."
