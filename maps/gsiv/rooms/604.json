    "The wey curves around a tall statue, which stands upon a raised granite platform.  Carved of mica-flecked granite and standing nearly half as high as the city walls, the statue is of an elven archer, his arrow nocked and pointed towards an unseen quarry.  Moonlight sparkles across the mica embedded within the statue's granite form.",
