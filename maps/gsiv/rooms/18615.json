    "From the whitewashed walls and alabaster tile floors, to the wide skylights and vast array of ivory beeswax candles, everything about this room is light.  Gossamer silk panels undulate gently as they ride the shifting currents of air that pass through two narrow, slit windows, the breeze slowing just enough to allow candle flames to flicker without being extinguished.  Bracketed by two wide doorways, a pale yellow pine table occupies a place of prominence."
