  "description": [
    "The hallway's wooden planks creak gently underfoot, faintly reminiscent of the deck of a sailing ship.  The walls are nailed with all manner of small mementos of adventure at sea, each displayed in its own rustic driftwood frame.  A faint ocean dampness seems to linger in the air and cling to every surface."
