    "Vast stone pillars dot the rocky surface of this chamber.  The walls have been crafted with a raised mural, which depicts a section of buildings from the city street that is directly above this tunnel.  In the center of the ceiling is a dark gaping hole.  A rush of water pours from the hole into a seemingly bottomless pool of water."
