    "A garden thrives with creeping clematis and blaestonberry covering the walls on this side of the gate.  Crowns of trees stretch high above the walls of thick stone.  Boxwoods shaped into an odd group of creatures stand sentinel on the grounds.  In the dim light of the moon, the topiaries cast menacing shadows across the ground.  Rocks that have been chiseled into their current forms and fit together like puzzle pieces protectively surround beds of flowers in full bloom.",
