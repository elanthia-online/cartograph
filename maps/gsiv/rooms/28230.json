    "The cobblestones here are worn and faded from countless hours of training and weathered by the elements.  Wooden racks and tables clutter a corner of the grounds, providing a wide assortment of training weapons and armor.  Uniformed militiamen carry out practice drills nearby.  A thick oak door leads into a two-story brick building, and on the other end of the square resides a small grey sandstone edifice."
