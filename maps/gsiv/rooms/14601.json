    "[Outlands Manor, Tower Roof]"

  "description": [
    "A battlemented rampart rings the slate-shingled pyramid of the tower's roof.  From here the dilapidated manor house stands a stone's throw to the south, and the diminutive ruins of the village cover the gentle slope of the hillside to the southwest.  The hills to the north grow into foothills before the snow-capped bulk of mountains farther north, while to the east lie the hills and river valleys of the borderlands.  South of here, the manor's hill descends into the rolling prairie common to the outlands."
