  "description": [
    "Oak barrels stand in a neat row against the edge of the platform, well away from the steps that lead deeper into the shop.  Above the barrels, a clever pulley system is operated by a tiny wheel secured into the rough bark of the ancient tanik tree and attached to ropes that dangle over the platform's edge.  Colorful banners, each splattered with various colors of wayward dye splotches, form a taught roofing system that protects from the elements while allowing the outside air to easily pass through."
