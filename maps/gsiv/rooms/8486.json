    "The air is far too still.  Red light washes the tiny chapel in a bloody glow, coming from the pristine stained glass window to the north.  Sitting before the window is a small thanot altar, covered with a heavy film of dust.  A small rectangle of satin lies in a heap at the base of the altar, with little puffs of stuffing about it, as if the pillow had simply given up the ghost.",

A small rectangle of satin lies in a heap at the base of the altar, with little puffs of stuffing about it, as if the pillow had simply given up the ghost."
