    "Heavy branches, turned a slate grey by an unknown disease or infestation, have collapsed inward, blocking all access to this chamber.  Dagger-sized splinters of decaying wood are strewn across the floor, and a heavy odor, like the foul scent associated with bogs and weedy marshes, lingers in the area."
