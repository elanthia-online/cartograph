    "Sunlight streams in slender shafts through the vibrant green canopy above to illuminate the whitewashed floorboards that have been lashed to long ropes in the creation of this swaying bridge.  The heady scent of passionflowers drifts on the same light breeze that a myriad of brightly winged butterflies use to travel through the jungle.  Enormous sandstone blocks offer anchoring points for this suspension bridge that terminates in a courtyard at one end and a freshly-cut jungle path at the other.",
    "Moonlight streams in slender shafts through the vibrant green canopy above to illuminate the whitewashed floorboards that have been lashed to long ropes in the creation of this swaying bridge.  The heady scent of passionflowers drifts on the same light breeze that ruffles the wings of a myriad of brightly winged butterflies resting on the ropes.  Enormous sandstone blocks offer anchoring points for this suspension bridge that terminates in a courtyard at one end and a freshly-cut jungle path at the other."
