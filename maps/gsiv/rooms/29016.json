    "Sunlight streams through twin brass-framed portholes, reflecting off a seaglass wave mosaic in shades ranging from pale green to deep ultramarine imbedded in white-plastered walls.  A driftwood collage of a mermaid caught within a net hangs from a wooden beam, partially hidden behind a a stained teak counter.",
    "Soft moonlight pours through twin brass-framed portholes, dimly illuminating a seaglass wave mosaic in shades ranging from pale green to deep ultramarine imbedded in white-plastered walls.  A driftwood collage of a mermaid caught within a net hangs from a wooden beam, partially hidden behind a stained teak desk.  You also see a figurehead merchant and a wooden plank sign."
