    "Faceted crystal globes a foot in diameter hang at five foot intervals, casting their unsettling light down on the tightly woven spidersilk carpet that lines the floors.  Mounted on the walls between each globe is a pair of crossed jeddart-axes, their blades polished to a mirror finish reflecting the light which dances across the wall opposite them."
