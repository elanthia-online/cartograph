    "Twin tables run the length of the room parallel to each other, long wooden benches on the plank floor to either side of them.  Standing as host, a suit of black iron armor is positioned near the short hallway leading to the entry.  A large stone fireplace dominates the northern wall, a basket of sticks to one side and an archway to the other"
