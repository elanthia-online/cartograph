    "Encircled by towering shards of blackened granite, the large patio is formed of terracotta and illuminated by glazed ceramic torches that rest upon wrought iron tables.  Black sands fill a pit at the center where an enormous boulder is split down the middle, a male statue resting against its cracked face.  On the opposite edges of the sand, a copper female statue crouches."
