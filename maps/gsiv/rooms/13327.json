    "The cobbled walk travels through lush green lawns dotted with the stately forms of venerable oaks and sycamores.  Here and there, the rooftops of large residences are visible, their privacy guarded by extensive gardens, shrubs and rock walls.  Birds of all types are plentiful, as are squirrels that dash from tree to tree in bounding leaps.",
    "The cobbled walk travels through lush moonlit lawns dotted with the shadowy forms of venerable oaks and sycamores.  Here and there, the bright windows of large residences are visible, their privacy guarded by extensive gardens, shrubs and rock walls.  The night songs of crickets and frogs provide a constant serenade."
