  "description": [
    "The bedroom is as plush with velvet as the sitting room guarding its entrance.  The deep indigo has given way, though, to crimson as saturated and rich as blood.  A thick, white bearskin rug covers the floor, matching white, lace-covered pillows and snowy linens on the bed.  From behind the velvet curtains, a window offers a peek at a spectacular moonlit view of the mountains."
