    "A roughly rectangular acre of moonlit lawn spreads out to the north.  Tall dark green hedges define the area's border, with the closest exits being openings in the southern and eastern directions.  Various workstations for the improvement of martial arts, weaponry, and bodybuilding occupy positions under spreading walnut and chestnut trees.  Several unlit torches accompany each station.  Nearby, sandbags lie haphazardly piled under one particularly gnarled chestnut tree."
