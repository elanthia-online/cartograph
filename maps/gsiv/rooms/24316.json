    "The room is filled with delicious smells of simmering stews and baking bread.  Cooks and servants bustle about busily, looking a bit annoyed at your intrusion into their domain.  Several large ovens are lined up against a wall, and a convenient branch has been pressed into service as a shelf for pots and pans."
