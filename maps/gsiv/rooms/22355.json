  "description": [
    "Capped with a rounded dome of stained glass, the smooth walls of crimson-veined alabaster are fitted seamlessly into place.  An intricate frieze adorns the rotunda between velvet-draped arches, each leading deeper into the consulate.  The floor is inlaid with concentric rings of heliodor surrounded by an eight-pointed star of despanal.  Hanging on the wall just to the side of the entrance is an an ebon plaque, its dark frame embellished with muted golden gilt."
