    "The edge of the plateau undulates much like the fluted rim of a pie crust, causing the trail to snake back and forth.  The wind has managed to bore a fairly large hole through a lateral extension of the solid rock, presenting a sizeable ring of solid stone that hangs out over the sheer drop to the mountains below.  It might be interesting to investigate the ring except for the uncertainty of the ring's load-bearing qualities and the annoyingly shrill scream the wind makes as it races through the hole."
