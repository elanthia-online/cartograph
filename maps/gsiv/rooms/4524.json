    "This area of the mine seems to have been constructed almost as an afterthought; the ceiling juts downward in awkward places, making walking upright a dangerous prospect and careful steps are required as the floor is rough and riddled with holes and protrusions.  Casually piled to one side of the narrow corridor are several boxes, chests, and other containers."
