    "Monstrous brow ridges glower over blank, stone eyes.  Then the muzzle tapers down to ridged nostrils and a generously toothed mouth.  The monumental drake possesses a sense of tension, exhibited in each curve of carved muscle.  The level of sculpted detail is astounding, as if a living, breathing creature had been caught in slumber and sentenced to lie here for all eternity, imprisoned within its own magnificent form."
