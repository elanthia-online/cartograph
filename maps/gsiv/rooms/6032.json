    "A wide, deep culvert cuts between the turnip patch on the east side and a corn field on the west side.  Muddy water in the culvert flows slowly southward, carrying silt from the farmlands to the north.  The turnips in this area have been trampled, and their leaves are smashed and torn.  Rolton tracks are abundantly evident in the moist soil.  The tracks lead off in all directions, though, giving no clear indication of the perpetrators' whereabouts."
