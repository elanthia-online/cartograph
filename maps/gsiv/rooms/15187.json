    "Translucent pale blue glaes walls rise from a checkerboard lapis and glass floor.  Just above a blue-hulled modwir airship replica hangs a kelyn-framed animal court painting, and a steel-ribbed vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A blue-streaked white marble counter and a glass-topped blued steel case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
