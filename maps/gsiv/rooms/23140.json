    "Maps and other papers are strewn about the crowded room, and a multitude of closed crates and boxes offer both places to sit and places to hide.  One almost uncluttered wall sports an open window looking out onto the street below, with a small wooden step stool positioned for a strategic getaway.  The center of the room is relatively unobstructed, and the peaked roof offers the greatest headroom there."
