  "description": [
    "Fashioned of dozens of rocks fused together by silt, sand, and dirt, the small island rises above the waterline and is surrounded by a halo of large boulders.  Mist, created by the consistent tidal pounding of the outer boulders, fills the air and moistly clings to everything in its path.  Water rings mark the edges of the island where the tide has risen beyond the outer pieces."
