    "A light chill fills the air of this spacious wagon.  Beads of condensation continuously well up and trickle down the rhimar reinforced walls.  Void of decoration, this space appears better suited for supplies than sales.  Several large, square blocks of ice and a large mithril pail rest near a small circular hatch in the opposing wall."
