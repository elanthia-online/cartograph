    "Rough-hewn stone walls adorned by tapestries, sconces, and bas-reliefs enclose the spacious hall.  Carved oak posts support trusses overhead, each draped with a red and gold banner.  Arched, clerestory windows open to the sky with a thick, cut-glass, oriel window overlooking the waves rolling onto the rocky beach outside.  A blue stone mosaic and silver-veined quartz pedestal are at its center with colorful rugs, chairs, and sofas scattered across its stone-tiled floor."
