    "Tufts of wet moss spread along the trail, interspersed with stinking lumps of humid mud that strive to reach the surface.  The unsettling cry of a swamp lark occasionally breaks the incessant hum of the mosquitoes swarming around you.  A spongy trail leads to the south, heading deeper into the fetid swamp.  Gnarled lengths of twisted blood-vines dangle from the sheer rock wall that blocks passage to the north."
