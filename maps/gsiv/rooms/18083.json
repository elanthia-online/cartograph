    "Despite its spare architecture and dearth of furniture, the small chamber nevertheless has a sumptuous feel due to the thick patterned carpets lining the floor and the elegant lines of the central table and bookcase.  A pair of padded benches run along either side of the table, making it suitable for almost any use."
