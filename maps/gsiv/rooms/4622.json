    "Large columns of jet black marble ascending toward the high ceiling compliment the patterns of crimson flowing along the walls in elaborate designs.  Small niches are carved into the stone surroundings, each containing stylized golden felines beset with unblinking, dark ruby eyes.  A high dome expands to the north, while a pair of engraved felwood doors loom to the south."
