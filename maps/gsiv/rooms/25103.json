    "The moss-covered cobblestone construction of the dungeon is painted a strange shade of blackened crimson, a stark contrast to the vibrant green moss lining the walls.  Sitting against one wall is a tall iron maiden with two trails of dried, blackened fluid just beneath the eyelets of the headpiece.  A wide iron-braced door is ajar outside a stone cell at the end of the hallway."
