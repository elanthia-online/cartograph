    "The twin towering arched wrought iron gates give way to a uniform crushed shell path bordered on either side by overgrown black rose hedges and beds of red-gold sirenflowers, mingled throughout by ever-creeping vines of wisteria.  The path is circular along the iron fence, splitting sharply in towards the thicket in precise locations, marked by five tall alabaster pillars.  Converging at the center, the hedgerow paths form a pentagram encircling a clearing in which stands a black marble sanitarium, its seamless walls glowing in the moonlight.",
