  "description": [
    "At the rocky foot of an incline, two tunnels form a 'V' as they head away into darkness following their divergent routes.  The ceiling, both within the corridors and in this antechamber is irregular and low, with protrusions that threaten anything taller than a dwarf.  The dank odor peculiar to caves rides heavily on the air, carrying with it the pungent overtones of a crypt."
