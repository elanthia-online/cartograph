    "A dense copse of trees hugs the water's edge, while a small hole has worn through the limestone shore's crumbly base to form an inland pool ringed with swamp rose bushes.  The limestone then rises up at a low slant, the formation immediately covered with a thick coating of brownish-black mud, with a barely-there path cutting through it and leading inland.  Bridging over the swamp's expanse of water, a raised wood plank walkway makes its way through into the darkness.",
