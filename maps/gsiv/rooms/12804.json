    "Positioned before a brass-framed window, a long rectangular desk is supported by carved mahogany legs.  Twin high-backed chairs stand before the desk, while an enormous leather chair fitted with wide armrests rests behind.  Framed in polished linden and tacked to the western wall is a map of the entire Vornavian Coast, while upon the eastern wall a map of the Cairnfang Forest rests, framed in oak."
