    "Torch light casts long wavering shadows, which dance eerily beneath the branches.  Centered between two rows of fruit trees, gurgling and splashing sounds rise from an open tub that looks something like an oversized wine-press.  A closer look reveals an odd contraption consisting of a copper-lined vat with a series of tightly spiraled copper rods sunk deep into its liquid contents.  Attached to a circular armature supported by the copper rods, four T-shaped handles are evenly spaced around the ring.",
