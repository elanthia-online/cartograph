  "description": [
    "The air is humid and sticky here, the leafy canopy overhead seeming to hold the moisture in along the path.  Brightly blooming flora lines the walkway, a smaller path branching off towards a raised wooden building that can be spied through the trees.  At the entrance to the building rests a low bamboo rack that sits on a thick woven grass mat, and is covered with a variety of footwear, presumably to store it as one enters the building.  A solid stone archway offers the shelter of the ruin, while a swaying rope bridge leads on."
