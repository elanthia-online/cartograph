    "Elaborately etched gold sconces inlaid with sparking moonglae opals adorn both sides of the archway, casting a warm glow over the area.  Imbedded within the walls are pieces of gems, which sparkle brilliantly under the glow from the torches.  A black velvet tapestry raised with silver stitching, depicting a thin, pale-skinned, black-haired woman holding a golden key in her hand, hangs opposite the granite arch."
