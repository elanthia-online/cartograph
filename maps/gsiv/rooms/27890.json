    "A blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls, and an ebonwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A carved ebonwood dinghy sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is a jewel-inlaid caddy on one side of the shop and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on the other."
