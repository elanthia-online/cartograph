    "The Guildmaster office is roomy and tastefully decorated.  Paintings of previous Guildmasters hang on the wall above the mantle of a stone fireplace.  The opposite wall curves inward, its numerous windows providing a view of the beach and ocean.  Supple leather chairs provide comfortable seating to enjoy the view.  A black marble desk sits in front of a bookcase filled with ancient tomes of lore."
