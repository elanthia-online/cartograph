  "description": [
    "Some warped, wooden storage boxes are stacked in disheveled columns toward the ceiling and partially conceal the damp, musty walls behind them.  The dank smell of mold and mildew hangs heavily in the air.  Muck, more than the sprinkled sawdust, make up the spongey floor.  A few overturned crates rest in the center of the room, visible only by the benefit of the scant light peeking in from the main cellar room's chamber to the west."
