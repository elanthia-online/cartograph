    "Sunlight streams through the branches of the pine trees that surround the springs while short bushes fight for what sun they can gain in the shadow of the pines.  Lush grass creates a ring of green carpet around the pool.  A hollow log rests near a circle of flat stones that surround the hot springs.",
