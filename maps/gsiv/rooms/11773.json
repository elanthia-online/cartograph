    "Wooden planks that long ago warped into bent and twisted shapes are all that allow passage into this dank, muck-filled grotto.

A few trees solemnly greet visitors to the area, their trunks deeply submerged within the swamp, and their long, thick leaves bending down so far as to brush the brackish water.  A pair of guttering torches cast a fitful light against the almost tangible gloom."
