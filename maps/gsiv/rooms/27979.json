    "Hanging down from the ceiling of a voluminous cavern are massive stalactites matched by equally sizeable salagmites that thrust up out of the ground.  Faintly glowing strands of light bob and weave through the air in lazy, meandering paths.  Flowing along from east to west, a fairly sizeable palisade wall blocks any view further into the central part of the cavern.  Oddly, the wall is somewhat insubstantial, as if it only partially exists in this time and place."
