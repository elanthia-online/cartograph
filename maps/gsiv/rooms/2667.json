    "The chamber's center aisle is spanned by an impressive pointed barrel-vault, emphasizing the ceiling's lofty height.  Light falls at the north end, illuminating a twisted form of ice so large, it reaches to the ceiling, as if lifting arms of ice in supplication.  Where the massive ice form begins, side aisles branch to the northwest and northeast.  Curiously, the frozen formation resembles a gigantic dragon's head, its mouth open to reveal curved teeth taller than a giantman."
