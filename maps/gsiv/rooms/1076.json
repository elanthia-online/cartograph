    "Solid rock stretches out in a hard grey sheet to form the plateau's surface.  Stiff and unyielding in the slightest, it is like walking on tempered steel or polished marble.  The wind has buffed the stone to a dull sheen, and though it means there are no protrusions on which to stub one's toe, it also means that footing can be slick and treacherous.  The cold wind has allowed none of the day's sunlight warmth to be absorbed into the plateau, and the stone surface is very chilly to the touch.",

The wind has buffed the stone to a dull sheen, and though it means there are no protrusions on which to stub one's toe, it also means that footing can be slick and treacherous.  Although the sun shines down brightly, the cold wind also removes heat before the plateau can absorb it, leaving the stone surface chilly to the touch."
