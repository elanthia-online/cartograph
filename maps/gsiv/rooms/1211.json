    "The icy peak of Glatoph looms in the skyline to the north bringing to mind visions of frozen peril.  Fortunately, the path skirts its way around the base of the mountain, keeping a clear and relatively safe distance from more dangerous terrain.  You notice a patch of some unidentifiable grey moss growing along the northern base of trees."
