  "description": [
    "Droplets flow from a knotted wood ceiling down to thick banyan roots that form the natural walls of the tiny cavern.  Numerous formations of multihued crystals sprout from the roots and wind along the floor in a pattern resembling musical notes that bend and twist around each other.  The atmosphere is saturated with moisture, and the scent of fresh, clean water and ozone is prominent."
