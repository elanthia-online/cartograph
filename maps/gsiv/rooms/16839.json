    "Two orderly rows of large copper kettles span the length of this massive room, carefully monitored by dwarven workers clad in white smocks.  A network of steel-braced tubes feeds liquid in from the east into each kettle for boiling.  Fragrant dried hops are stored in a pair of giant bins and are added as needed to each kettle.  Kegs, barrels and casks are filled and transported below via an intricate pulley system.  The word \"EXIT\" has been painted in red letters above a pair of steel double doors."
