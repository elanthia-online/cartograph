    "This room is even larger than the entry, yet has one massive rug, the artistry of which is stunning but almost overshadowed by the large, masculine furnishings.  A pair of overstuffed dark wood sofas face each other with a mahogany coffee table between them that completes the conversational grouping.  Near a columned arch, an ironwood table rests against the wall with ornate weaponry displayed above it.  Well-worn leather chairs are placed haphazardly around the room in pairs, lending a lodge-like feel to the den."
