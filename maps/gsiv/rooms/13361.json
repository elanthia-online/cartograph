  "description": [
    "A low, greystone wall looks down on the formal gardens outside the public library, then east across the main business districts of central Ta'Illistim.  A row of meticulously cared-for cherry trees lines the emerald lawn, their pink blossoms filling this end of the garden with delightful perfume.  A pair of generously-cushioned benches offers a quiet place to rest and contemplate the vast cityscape in the quiet of this elevated retreat.",
    "Beyond the low, greystone wall the lights of central Ta'Illistim twinkle and shine, rivalling the starry night sky in scope and number.  A row of meticulously cared-for cherry trees along the edge of the lawn fills this end of the garden with delightful perfume.  A pair of generously-cushioned benches offers a quiet place to rest and study the stars in the quiet of this elevated retreat."
