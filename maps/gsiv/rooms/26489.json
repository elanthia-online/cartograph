    "From a reservoir seated in the chiseled stone floor, water rises through a smoky-hued sphere of crackled glass and courses over its smooth surface, burbling softly as it trickles into the pool at the base.  Shadows play within the depths of the sphere, light trapped, stirred, and sent dancing outward as the water continues in its ceaseless journey.  Tall iron braziers stand between each lancet window that rings this circular space, lending a touch of warmth to the cool bestowed by the stone and sea."
