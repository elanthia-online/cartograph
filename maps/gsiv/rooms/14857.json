    "Meandering through the shadows of the imposing trees, the path takes a skip over a small stream gurgling across its path.  The rill's banks are cloaked in shadow, and its song graces the night.  It has the transient appearance of being short-lived, but, at the same time, an ageless, ancient quality.  The songs of frogs can be heard, their authors hidden in the moss and ferns standing guard over the water.",

The songs of frogs can be heard, their authors hidden in the moss and ferns standing guard over the water."
