    "A subtle musky scent slightly overshadows the smell of the sea air.  Showcased in the middle of the room are some large red chairs, and behind them, an apothecary's cabinet is mounted on the back wall.  A barrel stands in one corner beside a small curtained archway.  Some brass lanterns hang from the rafters, swaying every so often with the movement of the ship."
