    "Falling from the peaked ceiling in tailored pleats, the violet silk forms smooth walls and pools elegantly on silver rugs.  Frosted glass lanterns dangle from silver chains over a glass counter, providing excellent illumination by which to view the wares, while a pendant lantern hangs over a polished white table, which houses additional wares."
