  "description": [
    "The high tower rising to the north and the rounded glaes dome of the aviaries to the south create a deep canyon that remains shadowy and cool throughout the day.  From this vantage the strange dichotomy of the dry, desert-like aviary existing next to the thickly grown jungle environment within the dome is readily apparent.",

From this vantage the strange dichotomy of the dry, desert-like aviary existing next to the thickly grown jungle environment within the dome can barely be made out in the dim moonlight."
