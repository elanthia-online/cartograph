    "An unusual silence pervades the shadowy forest, and the trees press in tightly on either side.  High in the branches of one massive oak, barely perceptible, the long, scaly skin of something reptilian hangs down, apparently abandoned.  Steam slowly rises from the black, spongy flooring as the leafy canopy traps the heat.",
