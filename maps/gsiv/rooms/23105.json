    "Several rusted coiled metal springs are scattered around the room, which is lit with a handful of candles on the floor and moonlight streaming from several holes in the thatched ceiling.  Underneath a broken window framed with tattered curtains, a makeshift table is pushed up against the wall, its length filled with pestles, mortars, liquid-filled bottles, jars of herbs and flowers, and small wooden bowls.  A small wood-framed mirror leans up against the far wall, surrounded by growth pushing up through the ground.",
