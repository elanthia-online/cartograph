    "Small houses line the road, painted in a riot of bright colors.  The dwellings follow no set plan, some with one story, others with two.  Halflings wander down the road, waving to each other and stopping to converse.  One halfling stands on a ladder, carefully touching up the paint on his roof while his wife looks on, giving orders.",
