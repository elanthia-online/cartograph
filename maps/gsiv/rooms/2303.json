    "Small houses line the road, painted in a riot of bright colors.  The dwellings follow no set plan, some with one story, others with two.  Halflings wander down the road, waving to each other and stopping to converse.  One halfling stands on a ladder, carefully touching up the paint on his roof while his wife looks on, giving orders.",
    "Small houses line the road.  The dwellings follow no set plan, some with one story and others with two.  The street is almost deserted at this time of day, with only an occasional halfling passing by with home and hot food clearly on their mind."
