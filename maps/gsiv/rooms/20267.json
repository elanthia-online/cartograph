    "The front of this caravan hosts a series of neatly arranged racks and shelves all boasting ladies' garments.  Checked cloths in bright hues cover two prominently placed tables, beneath which lies a half-hidden, battered wooden dress form.  A silver tray rests atop a glass display case, and matching silver sconces are bolted to the oak walls.  Stray beams of moonlight filter through the open window, and the occasional humid breeze wafts in the faint scent of the swamp."
