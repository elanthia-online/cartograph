    "Beneath a mosaic tiled ceiling, a painting of a sundress-clad songmaiden battling bandits hangs on one of the smooth granite walls.  A mithril treasure chest accented with a veniom music staff and a wide faenor-trimmed table sit in opposite corners while a tiered alabaster fountain rests on a glossy mahogany floor."
