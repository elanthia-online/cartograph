    "A low stone wall meanders along here in a state of disrepair, various stones lying to either side of it leaving small gaps.  Behind the wall sits the remains of a small stone cottage covered with a riot of trumpetvine.  Hummingbirds flit about, sampling the flowers on the vines.",

Behind the wall sits the remains of a small stone cottage covered with a riot of trumpetvine.  The small chittering noises of bats can be heard from inside the cottage, one occasionally swooping out a window frame to search for bugs."
