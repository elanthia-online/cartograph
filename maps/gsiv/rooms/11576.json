    "Saws and hammers of various sizes and designs were once attached to a pegboard on the bulkhead.  They now lie scattered about the deck among a welter of nails, pegs, brass swivels, pins, cleats, and dowels.  Planks and slabs of oak, ash, fel and tarred hazelwood have been jolted from neatly piled stacks into chaotic clusters."
