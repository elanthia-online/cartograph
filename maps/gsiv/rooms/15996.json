  "description": [
    "Simple torches cast light upon the roughly hewn white granite walls, revealing numerous scorch marks and a patch of soot that stands out in one corner, oddly resembling a large, humanoid silhouette.  Ash has collected in the deeper depressions of the floor and lies in small piles on a set of granite steps leading up to the garden.  Clear of all dust and debris, a large wooden bucket rests idly beneath a crack in the wall."
