    "Dense forest encloses the trail, obscuring the ground with thick banks of discarded leaves and blocking vision in any direction with a tangle of black branches and foliage.  Cinnamon ferns grow between the trees, creating lush mounds of arching fronds that wave languidly in the slightest breeze."
