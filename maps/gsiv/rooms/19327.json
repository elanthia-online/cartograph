  "description": [
    "A gentle, fresh breeze blowing through an open arched window plays a quiet lullaby across the strings of an ancient harp, and riffles some papers lying upon the nearby workbench.  A few leaves have blown in, and they lie upon a thick bearskin rug stretched out across the stone floor.  An armor tree stands beside a large, stone fireplace, and against the ash-paneled wall opposite the fireplace stands a large, ebony-framed bed."
