    "Beneath a vaulted crimson-hued glass ceiling, a richly spun damask tapestry hangs on one of the polished black obsidian walls.  A gold-veined black marble counter and a thorn-carved black marble shelf sit in opposite corners while a tiered crystal-inlaid fountain rests on a flawless obsidian floor."
