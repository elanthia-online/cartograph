    "Bashed and battered packing crates litter the ground, providing some traction for the carts and wagons that move regularly through the narrow confines of Trade Alley.  A few humble shops open on the alley, but the thoroughfare mostly serves as a delivery route for the businesses of Commerce Burrow and the homes of Dabbings Mews."
