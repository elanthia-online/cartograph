    "A two-toned stone wall absorbs the heat of the sun, and a young couple leans against it, munching on some pastries.  The sight of food, coupled with the smell of baking that permeates this corner of the town, inspires some passing townsfolk to hurry along to the nearest bakeshop or pub.",
    "A two-toned stone wall still radiates the warmth absorbed during the day, and an old couple leans against it as they rest from their travels.  The cold winds that whip around this corner of the town inspire the few passersby to hurry along to the nearest pub or inn."
