    "The creak of hawsers and the overwhelming scent of salt pervade aboard this oak-hewn dragonship.  Its holystoned deck rolls leisurely as its long oars, pulled inboard, rock with each swell.  Well-worn oarsman's benches are fixed to the exposed timber of its shallow-draft keel, with a carefully folded rectangular sail lashed to the mast stowed amidships, while a sealskin canopy is stowed forward for use in inclement weather.  A carved drake's head adorns its prow."
