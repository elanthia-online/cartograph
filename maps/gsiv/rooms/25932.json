    "Firs, cedars, pines, and spruce trees converge at the edge of the woods, sentries before the brilliant Lake Sasalis.  Its frozen surface is preternaturally smooth, affording a perfect reflected image of the surrounding mountains.  The snow is crisp with a crystalline coating of ice, marred only by a line of large pawprints near the treeline."
