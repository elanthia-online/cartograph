    "A wide, bowl-shaped table of brown granite with a narrow extension sits atop two white marble supports in the southeast corner of the tavern.  Oval and flat, the bowl-shaped end appears perfect for holding a roundtable meeting, although those sitting at the extension end might feel slightly left out.  Deep gouges cut into the surface of the table run from the tip of the extension end down to the center of the bowl end.  A goodly number of stone chairs surround the table, providing ample places to sit."
