    "A large makeshift table surrounded by empty casks for seating takes up most of the space here.  A single lantern provides minimal light for a long and detailed notice that is posted on the back wall of the tent.  Swirls of silvery mist occasionally creep under the edges of the tent and tapestry to swim around the base of the table before fading away."
