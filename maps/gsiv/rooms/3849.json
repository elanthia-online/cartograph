    "The broad sweep of the sea glass floor is interrupted by some puffed raw silk pillows.  Halfway to the cloud-painted ceiling, a wrinkled parchment gown pattern hangs on one of the white silk-paneled walls.  A large oak table and a small brown box are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
