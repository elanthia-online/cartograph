  "description": [
    "At the base of the bluff, various heights of the soaring basalt columns that form the base of the plateau have broken off to create seatings providing a commanding view of the dark beach.  Even faint starlight causes a winking glimmer along the length of black sand.  Tall iron stands buried deep into the soil and filled with oil-soaked, rag-wrapped torches light the way just above the high water line.",
    "At the base of the bluff, various heights of basalt columns cluster and soar to form a jagged plateau, many of their once sharp hexagonal edges near-rounded from exposure to high tides, crashing waves, and the elements for eons.  Broken off pieces mound in the sand like fallen logs, littering the immediate beach with seatings providing a commanding view of the beach.  Cold, empty iron stands mark the high water line, their accompanying torches removed during the day."
