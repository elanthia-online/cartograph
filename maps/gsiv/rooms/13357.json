    "This room is decorated in stark wintery hues.  A silvery-grey carpet covers the floor, while matching curtains frame the pure white walls.  The large four-post bed features black and white spotted pillows above an elaborately embroidered comforter.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of white narcissus."
