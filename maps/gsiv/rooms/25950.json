    "Flowers of every shade of gold, from pale lemon yellow to dark tawny red, surround a massive blue-flecked sunstone sundial that sits on a raised mound of grass on the southern side of the path.  A circular bench sits near the rampart wall, allowing contemplation of either the sundial or the procession of names.  Threading through a sunstone sundial, a walkway leads to an open air shrine next to the keep."
