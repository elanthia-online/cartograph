    "Obviously proud of the work done in the premises, the Shop Master has set up a large glass-topped marble case in which samples of exemplary sheath-making are displayed against a contrasting background.  Although far from impeccable, the work area is uncluttered and well-ventilated as the always-open windows allow for any strong odors to quickly find their way to the outside."
