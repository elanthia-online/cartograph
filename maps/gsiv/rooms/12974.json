    "Pale stones litter the grassy hillside and gleam with the faintest of reflected light.  A dense thicket of briars covers the lower eastern slope in a thorny tangle, and dry runners and tendril vines encroach on the path.  Further up the hill, the rounded side of a tall tower looms against the starry sky.",
