    "Draped over the side of the wagon, a large piece of thick sailcloth creates a large tented area.  Several wooden boxes are piled against the wall with their lids partially removed.  A small basket filled with various pouches and sacks is tucked beside them.  Straw spills from a wooden crate, several sets of mortars and pestles can be seen tucked inside.  A cloth-covered opening leads back into the shop.",
