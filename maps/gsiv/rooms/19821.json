    "Highly burnished mahogany wood, accented with pale pine molding, lines the walls of this small library.  A two-column portcullis bookcase stands against the far wall, overflowing with tomes, scrolls, and manuscripts.  A heavy oak table, surrounded by some plush-cushioned oak chairs, provides an ideal location for a comfortable read."
