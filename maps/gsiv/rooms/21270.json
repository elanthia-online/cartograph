    "The broad sweep of the dark oak floor is interrupted by a plush black bear fur rug.  Halfway to the light oak ceiling, a sphere-hilted mounted sword plaque hangs on one of the stark stone block walls.  Some hammered copper display hooks and a spacious grey slate counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
