  "description": [
    "Here in the Cups, the knotty-pine walls are hung with a variety of game trophies and paintings.  A row of booths lines the back wall, and opposite them stands a long, low bar with a shining brass foot-rail.  Wooden panels suspended from the ceiling sway gently back and forth, propelled by a complex system of cords and pulleys that crisscrosses the wainscoting.  The panels whisper a lazy swish that keeps the air moving gently and dissipates the distinctive aroma of cigar smoke."
