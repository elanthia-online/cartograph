    "Tapestries hang over the wood paneled walls.  They depict a number of scenes, from a brilliant star in the sky to the rocky slopes of Thanatoph to a gently rolling sea.  Oil lamps burn in the corners of the room, providing soft light and a soothing scent.  Several multicolored pillows have been placed in the center of the room."
