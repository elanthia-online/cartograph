    "Constructed from white monir, an altar has been masterfully carved with vines and flowers in all shapes and sizes.  Frosted glass-globed lanterns have been strategically placed throughout the area and cast a warm, soft glow of light, which illuminates the low altar.  Directly behind the altar is a marble statue of a robed female figure, with her head bowed and her hands clasped together as if in prayer.  Piles of pillows in varying shades of yellow, green, and white spread out from the base of the altar."
