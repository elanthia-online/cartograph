    "A gold and crimson wyvern tapestry hangs on one of the dark brocade walls, and a high arched ceiling rises overhead.  A wyvern painted ivory vase sits in one corner of a dark mahogany floor.  There is an intricately carved ebonwood stand on one side of the shop and a polished maoral table on the other."
