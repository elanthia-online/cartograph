    "A thick forest of pine and fir hugs the edge of the plateau.  The trees are heavily draped with fallen snow, and drifts are piled up against the large trunks.  The well-marked trail moves off into the forest to the southwest while to the northeast it slowly descends into the Khalerineth Valley.  Looking east, the waters of Mreanith Lake sparkle in the moonlight, and to the north the DragonSpine Mountains thrust their cloud-shrouded, snowcapped peaks high into the sky.",
