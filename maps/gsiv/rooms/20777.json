    "The timbers of the lofted ceiling are exposed in repeating arches down the center of the stone room.  The large area is split at the northern end by several screens.  Natural light filters in from above through lancet windows, glittering across the contents of a wide oak table.  A pine-framed oil painting hangs above the stone hearth in the eastern wall, and in front, a group of settees are arranged around a burgundy and gold rug.  On the same wall is a carved linden arch and a curved crimson doorway, while opposite, a set of glass double doors leads outside."
