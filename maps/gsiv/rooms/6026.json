    "Two circular pens stand, one to the northwest and one to the southwest.  Long cedar planks intersect within holes cut in vertical cedar beams.  The planks stack up four high, with the width of a plank between each.  This is easily adequate to contain animals that do not tend to jump, such as roltons.  Farther to the west, a turnip patch spreads out, the tops of the vegetables forming curving rows.  Paths also lead northeast, east, and southeast through the scrubby weeds."
