    "The overlook approaches a series of seven immense waterfalls cascading down the mountainside to the east.  As the ledge nears the cataracts, the air is saturated with humidity from the rain of spray.  Ferns grow to lavish size, rooted in patches of earth, and palms wave huge fronds dripping with condensation."
