    "The Music Library is a small, somewhat dark chamber with no windows and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.  A fan hangs from the high ceiling, its quiet swish picking up edges on some of the papers crowding the shelves and teasing them into a lazy flutter.  A few chairs attend a long, teak library table in the room's center.  The table's surface is cluttered with sheaves of music and an array of small flutes and ocarinas."
