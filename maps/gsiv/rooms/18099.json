    "The modwir walls within this small enclosed room are cleaner than the remainder of the wagon.  Small splotches of pink and red ink are the only blemishes on the polished modwir surfaces.  A small table and two chairs sit in the middle of the area.  Glass-paned lanterns hang from overhead beams and bronze hooks on the wall."
