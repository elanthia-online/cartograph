    "This large rock is flat and dry, providing a nice place to stop and rest midstream.  The brook rushes quickly past on both sides, foaming white around the edges of this perch.  A small pool forms on the downstream side of the rock with an occasional fish darting through the cool green depths.  The musical sound of water cascading over stones combines with the song of nearby birds to create a forest melody."
