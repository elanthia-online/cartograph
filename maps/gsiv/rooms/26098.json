  "description": [
    "Faint shimmering wards run along the black walls of this circular laboratory, while the dark ceiling stretches to a high apex of opaque glass windows which allow for a warm glow from the moon to bleed through.  Situated in one corner is a polished drakar-inlaid crucible, just opposite of a slate-topped workbench.  Two large bookshelves stand like wooden sentinels on each side of a rune-carved steel door."
