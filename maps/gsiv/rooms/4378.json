    "Several rainbow glaes sconces are on each wall, providing enough light so that the wares in this room are clearly displayed.  Along the back wall is a row of three female mannequins, while a pair of rich leather armchairs sit opposite each other on the sides.  A small table of refreshments has been placed in the center, seemingly available to shoppers while they peruse."
