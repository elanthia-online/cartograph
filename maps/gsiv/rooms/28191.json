    "[The Primrose Pavilion]"

  "description": [
    "Draping layers of finespun gold silk linen compose the airy canopy of the tall-peaked pavilion.  Several illuminated bronze lanterns are suspended over a wide-curved dark oaken bench that spans across the back of the room, giving off steady, gilded light throughout the space.  The crisp scent of bergamot drifts lightly upon the air, adding a comforting warmth to the cordial ambiance."
