    "Small frosted globes hang from the domed ceiling by slender bronze chains.  Standing in the center is a trio of mannequins arranged in a circular pattern.  Lengths of crimson, ebon and indigo silk wrap about ironwood poles that hold up the thick dark velvet creating the canopy roof above.  Tucked in the back of the area is an iron-banded witchwood barrel, its surface stamped with undecipherable arcane runes.",
