  "description": [
    "The old chapel is sparsely lit.  Once, votive candles burned in red glass holders set in niches in the walls, lighting the room with a warm golden glow.  The room is full of shadows now, cold and silent as the grave.  A dark wood altar sits in the middle of the room, and the kneeling pillow before it is in tatters, but, from age or some other force you cannot tell.  The feeling of the area is one of peace, but somehow, this is not a peace most would choose to experience."
