    "Crenellated like a miniature fortress, the facade of the city's armory towers above.  Though the building's grey stone walls are weathered with time they still show the chisel marks used to form the massive blocks.  Twin bronzed breastplates flank the wide door leading into the establishment.  Several city guardsmen stand nonchalantly nearby watching for signs of troublemakers.",
    "With an undecorated pediment and plain frieze, the facade of the city's armory towers above.  The building's silvery blue stone walls are weathered with time, showing their age in worn water rivulets and soft edged corners.  Twin silver breastplates, each emblazoned with the Illistim peacock, flank the arched door leading into the establishment.  Above the roofline, a dais hovers."
