  "description": [
    "Built beneath a conical shelter, the eastern side of the roof is devoid of a wall and has only a narrow railing that prevents a fall to the ground below.  The northern wall has an enormous opening, where a large ballista sits at the ready and is flanked by several narrow-framed openings that provide clear views of the road beyond the small colony's open front gates.  A small hatch is bolted open, providing access to a ladder that leads to the first floor."
