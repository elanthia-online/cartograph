    "This room is small, lit only by a single blue torch.  A black velvet cloth hangs over a small arch leading into the main chapel, its soft fringe brushing the obsidian floor with a whisper.  Several baskets of herbs sit in the corner.  Opposite the archway opens a black thanot door, runes covering the surface like spiderwebs."
