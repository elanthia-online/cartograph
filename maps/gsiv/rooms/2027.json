    "Where a cliff emerges from the forest, moonlit beach sand sweeps around the base of large boulders in wind-sculpted dunes.  A dark log, beached by the surf, is half-buried in the drifts.  One gnarled branch still clings to the log, its dark silhouette resembling a contorted hand.  It points toward the cliff with its knotty fingers, as if trying to reach a handhold there to escape the ocean's clutch.",
    "Where a cliff emerges from the forest, silvery beach sand sweeps around the base of large boulders in wind-sculpted dunes.  A log, bleached grey by sun and surf, is half-buried in the drifts, its color little different than the sand that holds it.  One gnarled branch still clings to the log, its silhouette casting a ragged shadow across the beach that resembles a contorted hand.  It points toward the cliff with its knotty fingers, as if trying to reach a handhold there to escape the ocean's clutch."
