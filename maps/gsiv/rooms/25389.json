    "This spacious master retreat is an ecclectic mix of child-centric and adult-centric possessions.  A small herd of tiny wooden horses graze beside empty whiskey bottles on a green-quilted, four-poster bed.  Bold drawings in chalk and colored wax are scrawled across the walls.  A floppy, red-haired ragdoll dangles lifelessly on a noose hung from a trapdoor in the ceiling.  Upon the nightstand, toy soldiers stand guard beside crystal bowls filled with stale ashes and the mascerated stubs of old cigars."
