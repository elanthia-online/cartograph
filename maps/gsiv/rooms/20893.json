    "Startling white against the dark green foliage, a jasmine vine weaves a sinuous path through several trees to create a thick screen of brilliant white blossoms that partially obscures the clearing on the other side.  Exotic scents collide as the heady perfume of the flowers mingles with the earthy warmth of the crushed cinnamon bark path that winds through the jungle."
