    "The cobblestoned walkway deviates from its straight, narrow path and takes the form of a ring that borders a circle of well-groomed grass of deep green hue.  Along the western circumference of the curved path is a small building, its walls cultivated with an impressive collection of twining ivy.  Sprigs of moonflowers creep along the grass within the center of the plaza, their peculiar but pleasing scent wreathing the area."
