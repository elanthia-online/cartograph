  "description": [
    "Pale crimson magnolia trees flank the ivory cobblestones, their long, tapered leaves shivering with a multitude of shadowed hues with every faint breeze.  A massive manor towers above the landscape a short distance to the north, while pleasant floral scents ride on the air.  Through the veritable forest of trees stretching out toward the east and west, one can glimpse the peaked roofs of other buildings."
