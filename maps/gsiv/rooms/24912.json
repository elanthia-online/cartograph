    "Multicolored cobblestones spiral out from an impressive stone fountain in the center of the plaza, the effect a dizzying array of colors from expert craftsmanship.  Snow-capped mountain peaks to the north create a picturesque backdrop for the lifelike statues surrounding the font's basin.  In each corner, tables and chairs are grouped together beneath green-striped white canopy umbrellas."
