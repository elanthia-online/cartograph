  "description": [
    "The back yard is not large, and not very well tended.  Long grasses grow near the high pinewood fence that surrounds the yard.  A huge glaes trough, easily as long as a giantman, sits in the middle of the yard.  The ground near the trough sports no grass, and the soil is charred and scorched.  A low, wide barrel of water sits next to the trough.  To the right of the trough is a shining mithril anvil, surrounded by blacksmith tools."
