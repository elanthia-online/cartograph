  "description": [
    "Light streams through the bay window in this tiny portion of the shop.  Numerous containers holding more colors of dye are strewn around the room in a haphazard pattern.  The room is in contrast to many of the other dye rooms, as it is colored with child-sized handprints on the walls and is not as organized as the rest.  A colorful patchwork rug is placed towards the back of the room, leading shoppers on through the shop."
