    "Surrounded by flowering trees, the teak and cedar villa sprawls across a petal-strewn lawn along the northern edge of the street.  Glassless windows provide a view of the cobalt blue walls of the interior, while the exterior is marked by an elegant painted sign and an arched entry that exudes a welcoming atmosphere.  Golden sunlight illuminates the tangled clusters of the surrounding foliage, which provides a pleasant contrast to the bright white of the cobblestoned street.",
    "Surrounded by flowering trees, the teak and cedar villa sprawls across a petal-strewn lawn along the northern edge of the street.  Wide open windows, illuminated from within, provide a view of the cobalt blue walls of the interior, while the exterior is marked by an elegant painted sign and an arched entry that exudes a welcoming atmosphere.  Circles of lamplight pool upon the cobblestones and cast shadows in the surrounding foliage."
