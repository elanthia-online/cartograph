    "Refined oak-paneled walls rise from a varnished dark oak floor.  Just above a woven Vornavian silk rug hangs a fused sun and moon wall-hanging, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  A Vornavian silk-lined display case and a painted white oak table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
