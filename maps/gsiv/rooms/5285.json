    "The path is nearly blocked by fallen rubble from one of the walls of the path here.  Shattered stones lie in huge chunks on the ground, making it necessary to choose the path carefully and climb occasionally to proceed.  Weeds grow amongst the boulders, occasionally dotted with colorful wildflowers."
