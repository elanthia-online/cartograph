    "Pieces of driftwood have been carved to resemble the broad wavy leaves of a mermaid's fan plant.  Each piece has been lashed to the next to form roughly a semi-circular table that tapers into what can only be the stem of the plant at the base of the table.  The driftwood appears to have been dyed a deep green color to give the carving a more natural appearance."
