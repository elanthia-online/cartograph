    "High above the auditorium, this box seat provides a perfect view of the stage and its heavy curtain.  Gold accents on the railings and thickly padded marble chairs sparkle in the lamp light as the flames flicker within their glass containers.  Serving trays rest on wheeled carts on the thick burgundy carpet near an oak door embossed with golden scrollwork leading back outside."
