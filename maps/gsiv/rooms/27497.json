    "You see a triangular space dramatically lit by numerous hanging glass globes, each one containing a single, flickering candle.  The olive colored walls and deep maroon ceiling have been fashioned of a sturdy fabric, cleverly draped to create an inviting space.  A hint of spice lightly scents the air.  Padded benches line two of the tent's three walls and are scattered with overstuffed cushions in a variety of sizes and shapes."
