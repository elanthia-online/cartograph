  "description": [
    "A blocky building walled with squared stones and roofed with drab grey-green tin sits off to the side of the road, interrupting the fence that creates a perimeter for the town.  The split-rail barrier picks up on the other side of the building and travels on, though several lengths of heavy chain are draped across the upper rail nearest the stone wall."
