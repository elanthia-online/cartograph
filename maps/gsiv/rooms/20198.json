    "A large fallen tree lays beside the path, swathed in a blanket of feathery, tendriled moss.  All along its now horizontal bulk, silk ribbons of silver and green are entwined with the moss draped branches, and tiny bells dangle from each ribbon's bow.  A cutout of a painted wooden rolton looms on the other side of the path near a basket of rolton tails and an unshaven huckster.",
