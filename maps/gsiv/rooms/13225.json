    "An austere anteroom of pale-ivory walls that meet a simple white marble floor contains few clues about the nature of this temple, aside from the garlands of fragrant roses hanging along the walls.  A flower blooming from a red heart is painted in loving detail, recognized as Oleani's symbol.  Stray petals of red and white lie on the floor, their scent released as they are crushed underfoot.  A heart-shaped archway leads out to the esplanade, while a short corridor leads north into the temple."
