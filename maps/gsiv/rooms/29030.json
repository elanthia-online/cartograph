  "description": [
    "Rippling smooths out the stratum as it rises to gigantic portions along the westernmost edge of the hard-packed dirt road, while towering rocks provide access to a cave entrance worn into the bedrock above.  Loose gravel, shale, and silt scatter across the ground where mosses and grass attempt to find purchase.  The distant sound of crashing waves echoes faintly in the air."
