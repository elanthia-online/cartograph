  ],
  "description": [
    "Thick, verdant tree ferns line the upper edge of this dank gully.  Both thick earth banks lean over, creating a dark, cave-like area.  Long strings of glowworms hang from above, giving off a soft luminescent light.  Tiny fungus gnats fly about from place to place, occasionally getting caught in the sticky threads.  The moist dirt easily gives way underfoot, releasing the scent of decomposing greenery."
