  "description": [
    "A wide, cylindrical aquarium sits in the center of this dimly lit, round room.  Intense blue-green lamps, placed directly above the big tank, shine directly down upon the water.  The focused lights illuminate the many brilliantly colored corals that make up the living reef, showing off their flashy, fluorescent qualities.  A circular mahogany bench surrounds the attraction, offering a place to rest and get a good view."
