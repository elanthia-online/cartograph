    "[Chamber of the Grey]"

  "description": [
    "Smooth grey stone rises from the even floor to create the curved walls of the circular chamber, their peaks disappearing into the shadows of the distant ceiling.  Warm and bright light emanates from candles that are arranged in tiny alcoves around the archway that leads to the south, while to the north, a series of large obelisks dominates the chamber."
