  "description": [
    "You are standing before a smooth wall crisscrossed by a number of long, deep grooves.  The grooves are scratched and pitted, with no pattern at all, as far as you can tell.  Near the floor, the grooves disappear, only to be replaced by finger-sized holes drilled straight into the rock.  Some rusted tools are piled against the wall and a thick layer of dust coats the floor, casting up swirling clouds every time you move your feet."
