    "Remnants of a massive avalanche that swept across the edge of the quarry and down into the pit have left an immense blockade of snow covering the road.  A large tunnel has been laboriously drilled through the ice and rock to allow passage and stand against future disasters.  Several villagers have taken advantage of the wide tunnel, building homes within its protective cover."
