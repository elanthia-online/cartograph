    "Twigs snap, leaves rustle, and it becomes apparent that something is paralleling your course from deep in the underbrush.  The heavy tree branches above cut off the moonlight, making it impossible to see more than a few feet in any direction, while the rampant humidity and lack of wind lend a tense stillness to the misty air.  A rancid scent of sulfur mingles with the odor of decaying vegetation.",
