    "Toppled on its side, an enormous banyan tree stretches across the pathway and lies its head into the stagnant waters of the nearby stream.  Mold and sludge have claimed most of the verdant canopy, while its roots lie exposed to the elements and still cling to large clumps of moist earth.  A series of tiny black capped mushrooms grow in the dark shelter of the fallen tree."
