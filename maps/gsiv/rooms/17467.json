    "[A Lofty Peaked Tent]"

  "description": [
    "The scent of leather and tanning oils hangs heavy in the air within the tent, unable to be banished by the sage bundle burning within a large clam shell toward the back.  Overhead, suits of armor are hung in various stages of creation, like empty skins left by shedding snakes.  In a half-moon at the center of the area are some leather straw-stuffed mannequins."
