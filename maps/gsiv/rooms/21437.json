  "description": [
    "Quilted silk lines the walls of this small, intimate alcove, the colors pale in contrast to the vibrancy seen throughout the main part of the tent.  A button-tufted champagne silk settee rests in the center of the room, holding court atop a small raised dais.  A table sits nearby, a padded satin sewing basket resting on top of it."
