    "While half of this clearing is still cluttered with the stubs of long-ago chopped trees, the remainder has been carefully cleaned of stumps, roots, and other impediments.  Tiered elmwood benches overlook runways that are outlined in white paint and extend the length of the hazard-free section, ending abruptly at the edge of a deep crevasse.  A pyramid-like arrangement of logs rests on the other side of the chasm."
