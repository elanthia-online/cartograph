    "Centrally placed is a large wooden oak tree, painstakingly carved to replicate its living counterpart.  The branches meld with the ceiling to create a lush, green silk and oak branch canopy overhead.  On the cobblestones beneath the tree, three wax figures rest in various poses on carved juniper bases.  Two black-framed paintings hang on the trunk of the tree, while a carved stone bench sits nearby.  Glass-paned oil lanterns dot the muted blue walls, illuminating the room with a golden glow, while a bas-relief image of a woman hangs nearby.",
