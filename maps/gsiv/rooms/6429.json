  "description": [
    "The old saloon looks as if it has seen a few too many wild parties.  All of the tables, benches and chairs have been broken and scattered about the room.  On the north wall, a long bar looks as though it has been bashed with battering rams.  Overhead, a large chandelier dangles precariously from the ceiling, the bolts that fasten it nearly ripped from their moorings."
