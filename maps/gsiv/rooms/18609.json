    "The high walls of this room are completely covered with the carved renditions of many rows of bookspines, making the surroundings resemble the shelves of some vast library.  Situated in one corner is a life-sized statue of a man sitting upon a high-backed chair, looking as if the thousands of stone books were but a paltry collection to him.  A grey altar sits before the man, looking very out of place amidst the scholarly surroundings."
