    "Thousands of fireflies flit to and fro in the air above the bones.  Exactly what the attraction is for the fireflies is unknown, but their heatless lights wink on and off, illuminating the surrounding area in an eerily shifting, cold light.  Occasionally a bat wings through, mouth agape, harvesting the fireflies and leaving an empty swath in the firefly constellation.  Slowly, though, the fireflies fill the emptiness until the air seems once again occupied by evenly spaced fireflies."
