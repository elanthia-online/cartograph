    "The bones continue to flow imperceptibly to the southeast, southwest, and west, with a slightly steeper drop to the southwest.  To the east, barely noticeable in the firefly-lit gloom, the lip of a large crater rises a couple of feet above the bones.  The crater's sides are rough granite of the same composition as the surrounding walls and have served thus far to channel the bones around the hole to other parts of the cavern. A few more centuries and the crater itself may become the bone repository."
