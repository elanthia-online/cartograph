    "The trail, barely perceptible, snakes darkly among the brambles.  The trees stand closely, their soaring branches denying the moonlight to the twisted, grayish vegetation below.  A bit of faded red cloth, impaled on several pointed brambles, bears witness to the fact that others have gone before."
