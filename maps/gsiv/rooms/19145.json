    "The floor of this small area is covered with a colorful carpet, woven to depict the scenery of the bottom of an ocean.  The flooring is completed with sand, seaweed and coral.  Hanging from the ceiling is a tiny hammock stuffed with toys and a small driftwood shelf rests near the exit.  Large fake palm trees rest in one corner, their branches reaching down to partially conceal an overturned crate."
