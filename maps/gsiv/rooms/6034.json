    "To the west, a stately oak tree spreads its branches over the culvert and part of the turnip patch.  The oak's roots spread throughout the culvert to draw up the moisture that resides there, and the oak appears healthy and well nourished.  The oak's branches allow plenty of light to reach the turnips during the day, and the plants grow well despite the presence of their larger cousin.  For reasons unknown, the farmer has allowed this tree to remain.",
