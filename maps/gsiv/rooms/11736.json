    "From the direction of a hallway to the east, a loud clanking noise as if someone or something is bashing a metal object, Echoes into the vaulted chamber.  The tattered remains of an old tapestry lie heaped in a corner, partially concealing a broken metal rod from which it once was suspended.  Flickering light from five torches to the east create the sensation of dark figures moving back and forth in nearby shadows."
