    "The leaf-covered path wanders through an area in transition.  Large tree specimens from the arboretum are surrounded by wild seedlings trying to stake out their territory, while sword ferns and underbrush have already established their domain.  A large moss-covered maple has fallen nearby, its roots at the base of the giant trunk flaring high into the air.",

From overhead, squirrels can be heard scolding and occasionally seen leaping from tree to tree."
