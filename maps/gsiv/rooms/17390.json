    "Heaps of boxes take up most of the floor in this tiny space.  The only way out seems to be the corridor of boxes to the west.  The rats, however, have created another option.  A hole opens in the wall to the east, surrounded by bits of grain, shavings of wood, and other pieces of a rat's collection."
