    "A pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a glossy mahogany floor.  There is a jewel-inlaid caddy on one side of the shop and a glass-topped mistwood counter on the other."
