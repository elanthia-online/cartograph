    "The scents of salt water and brine are almost overwhelming in this room.  A colorful tapestry adorns one of the walls, its intricate weaves showing a black-sailed ship coasting away from a burning merchant vessel.  The ship's flag portrays the infamous skull and crossbones of a pirate cutter.  A large iron-banded strongbox lies on the ground beneath the tapestry.  You also see a wide black steel table with some maps and tools atop it, and some large chests on the ground beneath it."
