    "The curve of the expansive, smooth stone wall of the tower is broken up by pointed arches leading to light-filled chambers.  A bulky contraption, partially concealed with a swathe of torn sailcloth, is installed on a raised wooden platform.  A magnificent glass lens mounted on the top of the contraption harnesses the colorful light spilling from the chambers and projects a beam upward, slicing into the darkness overhead."
