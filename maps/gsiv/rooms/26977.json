    "Floored in pale blue limestone, the high walls and domed ceiling isolate this section of the gardens from the rest.  Massive rhimar and glass pillars, five in total, stand at even intervals and exude an extremely cold air that causes nearby plants to be kissed in frost.  An enormous ice sculpture wreathed in pale frostflowers and azure iceblossoms rises at the heart of the garden, its outstretched fingers nearly touching the rhimar-framed roof."
