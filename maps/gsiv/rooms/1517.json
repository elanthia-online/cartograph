    "Demonstrating various shades of pale grey stucco, the courtyard walls along this stretch of Scaup Road are otherwise indistinguishable.  Perhaps the various greys are more attractive in daylight and are just too subtle for starlight and moonlight to do them justice.",
    "Demonstrating the range of off-whites that stucco can attain, the courtyard walls along this stretch of Scaup Road are otherwise indistinguishable.  The north side of the road is an undisturbed expanse of first pale beige, then ivory, then dust-grey, while on the south side of the road are displayed alabaster, white with a hint of blue, followed by palest rose."
