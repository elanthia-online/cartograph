    "A draft slowly swings a large candelabra above back and forth over on the other side of the great hall, directly above a wide, black hole set in the middle of the floor.  Dark stains trail from a large examining table over the stone floor to the edge of the hole, from which emanates a rank odor.  Separating this area from the one to the south are a row of bookshelves brimming with tomes, scrolls, and odd artifacts."
