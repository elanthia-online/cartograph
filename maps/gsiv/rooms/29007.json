    "Cluttered with models, the shop has black walls, black ceilings, and black frames around the windows and door, though the floor is golden brown with a veneer that reflects the starlight as it streams in from outside.  Surrounded by bulletin boards that are overloaded with tacked parchments, a small long-legged desk with a tall stool behind it sits under the bright glow of a shielded lantern."
