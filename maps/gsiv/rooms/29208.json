  "description": [
    "An open expanse welcomes visitors to this artificially illuminated cavity formed deep within the earth.  The sheer size of it illustrates the effect of centuries of dissolution of the porous limestone by acidic groundwater.  Scorch marks and a heavy layer of soot mar the faces of several naturally formed columns affixed with brightly burning sconces."
