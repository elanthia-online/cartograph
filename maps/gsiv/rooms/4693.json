    "A sprawling featherbed occupies most of the space in this elegantly furnished bedroom.  A celestial scrollworked ebonwood settee abuts a wall painted in a deep midnight hue, and is arranged with several silvery crescent pillows.  Argent highlights adorn the decor, from the gauzy bed canopy to the plush navy carpet underfoot."
