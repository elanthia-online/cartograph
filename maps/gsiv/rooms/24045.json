    "The despanal-inlaid summoning circle dominates the center of the cavern.  Mottled veins of liquescent crimson stone bleed outward from the edges of the circle and snake toward the ceiling along the pale cavern walls.  Slick with condensation, hoary clumps of glowing lichen cast a murky green glow throughout the chamber.",
    "The despanal-inlaid summoning circle dominates the center of the cavern.  Mottled veins of liquescent crimson stone bleed outward from the edges of the circle and snake toward the ceiling along the pale cavern walls.  The ophidian breaks in the rocks are continued through the side of the cave, where a small stream enters and exits the chamber with a subdued rushing sound that echoes off a small dock.  Slick with condensation, hoary clumps of glowing lichen cast a murky green glow throughout the chamber."
