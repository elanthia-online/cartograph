    "Gnarled tree limbs serve as support for the tent's canvas lining as it sags at various points.  A reclaimed wood trunk rests centered upon a muddied reed mat.  Several broken and empty boxes are strewn across the floor.  Towards the back of the tent, an armoire stands off-balance, propped up on one side by a pile of old and decaying books."
