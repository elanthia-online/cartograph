    "On both sides of the tunnel, lantern light gleams off polished shields hanging from hooks in the dark rock walls.  Those to the north are painted and enamelled, while those to the south are decorated with jewel inlay.  More shields sit atop a makeshift table formed from shipping crates covered with a clean white wool cloth.  Although the tunnel's roof is tall enough for a giantman to walk upright, everything is placed conveniently low for the brown-robed dwarf tending the merchandise."
