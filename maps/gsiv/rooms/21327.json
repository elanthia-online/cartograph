    "The overhanging boughs of the surrounding trees enclose the area to form a quiet bower.  This shaded retreat provides a silent place of contemplation.  The quick flicks of motion as the birds and bees flit from tree to tree, or flower to flower, are the only distractions.  The only break in the warm embrace of the surroundings is a shaded path to the south.",
