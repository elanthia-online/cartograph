    "A gently sloping hillock forms the banks of Lake Tanai.  The narrow lake shimmers in the moonlight.  A few wooden structures and a field of sunflowers are visible on the opposite bank.  The branches of a tall, ancient oak tree form a canopy over the area.  An old, deteriorated stone well stands nearby.",
