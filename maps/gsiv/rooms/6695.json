    "This seems to be a guard post of a sort.  A pile of rough stones looks as if it would provide good cover from anyone entering these caves.  As you peer behind the pile of stones, you notice a round depression in the soil, apparently left by many shifts of sleeping sentries.  To the north, faint light can be seen from the cave entrance, and to the south the caves descend rapidly into the depths of the mountain.",
