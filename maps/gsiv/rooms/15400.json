    "A tall minaret, silhouetted against the moonlight, rises out of the thick brambles.  Only the arched entrance of the structure has been cleared of the twisting, impenetrable mass of brambles.  Although the base of the building is obscured, it's obvious from the upper aspects that it's shaped like an eight-sided star.",
