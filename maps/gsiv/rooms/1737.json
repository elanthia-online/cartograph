    "Small specks against the mountainside resolve themselves into the frozen carcasses of sparrows, thrushes and warblers.  The cause of their demise was most likely the cold, but why the birds came to be here in the first place is a mystery.  Perhaps they were forced down by storms or exhausted on their migratory flights.  Several of the carcasses have been torn open by predators.",

The cause of their demise was most likely the cold, but why the birds came to be here in the first place is a mystery.  Ravens flit among the carcasses, feeding on the icy flesh and keeping a watchful eye on your position through malignant yellow eyes.  Certainly they would like something a little meatier on which to feast."
