    "White shutters, drawn back to allow the sunlight to filter in, surround each of the cafe's windows.  Coral and scarlet tiles create a checkered pattern upon the floor, while the exposed rafters overhead dangle various local herbs and flowers used to produce the shop's teas.  Counters are arranged at angles to the corners and are topped with a variety of treats for purchase.  A welcome mat crafted of woven sea grass rests before the entry, its edges dusty and slightly frayed.",
