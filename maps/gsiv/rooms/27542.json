  "description": [
    "Several stark white chalk drawings decorate the shale walls, which glisten in the flickering torchlight as if covered in ice.  Indeed, a pervading chill further dampens the air while hoarfrost creeps along ivory-hued stalactites that dangle like icicles from the distant ceiling.  A frayed grey rug keeps an iron-bound driftwood rack and a stuffed cotton mannequin relatively protected from the moist floor but does nothing to lessen the sound of dripping water that bounces about the space."
