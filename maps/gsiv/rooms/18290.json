  "description": [
    "Muted by the substantial plant life, the distant sounds of crashing waves compete with the shrieks, barks, and trills from unseen jungle creatures.  Thick grasses create a deep carpet beneath towering trees that become silent, shadowed soldiers in the darkness of night.  Branches crisscross haphazardly in a quest to reach the starry skies above, creating an arbor-like mesh of foliage that enhances the gloom.  Still and heavy with moisture, the air stagnates and takes on a musky scent."
