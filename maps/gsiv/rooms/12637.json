    "This wooden building was utterly destroyed by fire.  The ceiling caved in completely, and now crunches beneath your feet.  The vines that seem to be everywhere have nearly overtaken this wrecked structure, spiraling up around the remaining supports, and crisscrossing overhead to form a living roof."
