  "description": [
    "A wide variety of hardy bushes and shrubs grows with surprising abundance on the steep hillsides of this region.  Equally surprising is the large number of very long, and very sharp, thorns that protect each bush and successfully discourage any thought of venturing off of the path.  In the distance, a deep gorge opens from the steep mountains to the northeast.  A waterfall tumbles violently out of the gorge, splashing to form a river that widens and slows as it flows over more even ground."
