  "description": [
    "The thick fog continues to hide the ground from sight along this east-west path.  Squirrels chitter occasionally from high above, dislodging an occasional twig or acorn that falls silently into the fog.  Sounds seem to be swallowed up by the fog, making practically all movement almost completely silent."
