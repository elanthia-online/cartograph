    "Beneath a low-beam red maoral ceiling, an enlarged Elanthian silver coin hangs on one of the paneled red maoral walls.  A multi-shelved ebonwood cabinet and an expansive red marble counter sit in opposite corners while an open ebonwood treasure chest stacked high with rubies rests on a red-veined black marble floor."
