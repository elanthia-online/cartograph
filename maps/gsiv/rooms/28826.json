  "description": [
    "Cut and smoothed from the waxy black stone comprising the spindly plateau on which it stands, the plaza slopes a bit toward its eastern extremity.  Beyond there is naught but open air and a long way down to a body of dark water that winds sinuously through the great cavern.  From such a distance, the water is mute and featureless."
