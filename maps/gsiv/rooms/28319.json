  "description": [
    "Moonlight flows through the branches of the trees that surround the springs while short bushes fill the spaces between the pines.  Lush grass carpets the area around a circle of flat stones that surrounds the steaming pool, one side of the formation creating steps that descend into the water.  A hollow log rests near a thick hedgerow that grows to either side of a scrollworked wrought-iron gate."
