    "The amphitheatre has been literally carved out of the mountainside.  Stone benches tier downwards towards a granite platform, upon which rests a carved podium.  Delicate glass orbs suspended from ironwork posts surround the stage, illuminating the area with a golden glow.  Moonlight glints upon the sapphire and silver banners as they gently stir in the cool night air atop the amphitheatre's surrounding walls."
