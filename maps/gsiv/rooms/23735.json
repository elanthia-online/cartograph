    "Shielded lanterns flicker with faint candlelight from their recessed positions within the four corners of the small storage room.  Heavy with dirt and discarded dried herbs, the uneven floor transitions from packed dirt near an oak and copper door to roughly hewn planks that support a series of storage shelves.  A thick curtain along the southeastern wall seems as though it might provide access to the floors above, but the heavy nails driven into its edges prevent further investigation."
