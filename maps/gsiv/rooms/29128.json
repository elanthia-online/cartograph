  "description": [
    "Deep furrows in the loose gravel underfoot tell the tale of travelers who nearly missed the sharp turnaround.  Just beyond the edge, atop craggy outcroppings below, scattered backpacks and clothing lay among broken shards of shelfae scales and a few sun-bleached bones.  Half-sized pines struggle to maintain a grip in the loose soil of the crevices nearby."
