  "description": [
    "Bas-relief designs decorate the western wall to create the image of a storm-tossed sea complete with thrashing waves and bouncing boats along a narrow pier.  Opposite, a carved wooden sculpture dominates the wall and stretches towards the ceiling where its spindled limbs dangle frosted globes that provide a soft misty light throughout the space.  Plump dark green cushions encircle the feet of the art piece, their ends decorated in autumn-hued tassels."
