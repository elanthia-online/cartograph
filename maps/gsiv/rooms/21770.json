    "This room is decorated in muted earth tones, giving a feeling of peace and contentment.  Obviously, the owner wishes to relax, away from the strife and combat of the wilds.  A solid oak chair sits before an equally sturdy oaken desk.  A plain but comfortable bed is the room's only other furnishing."
