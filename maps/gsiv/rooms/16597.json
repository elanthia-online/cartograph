    "Blue-speckled sea glass walls rise from a swirled sea glass floor.  Just above an intricate sea creatures display hangs a framed lighthouse painting, and a low skylight-set ceiling completes the picture.  An aqua-hued seaglass display and a shell-lined bamboo counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
