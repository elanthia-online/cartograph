    "A large wooden contraption takes up most of this room.  It resembles a grape or clothes press, with a heavy chain and padlock preventing anyone from raising the upper part of the press.  Beneath a workbench are several large wood blocks carved with words and pictures.  On top of the workbench are several smaller blocks similarly carved."
