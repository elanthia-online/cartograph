    "Well-oiled dark oak paneled bookcases form the walls of the spacious two story room.  Segmented floor-to-ceiling windows along the north wall provide a breathtaking view of the moonlit gardens.  The polished stained oak floor adds a stark contrast to the warm ivory rug, centered with an intricately carved ash table.  Several two-toned ivory and beige couches provide comfortable seating around a carved ivory limestone fireplace, which is centered along the western wall.  A spiral staircase leads up to the second floor walkway, providing access to the books above."
