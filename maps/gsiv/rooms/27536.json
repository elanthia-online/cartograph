  "description": [
    "Perched roughly fifty feet above the water's surface and twenty feet out, this slender outcropping provides access to one of the few sections of the surrounding sea that is not hampered by hazardous rocks.  With no security barriers to prevent a fall, the precarious perch offers no protection from high winds or walking mishaps and is not for the faint of heart."
