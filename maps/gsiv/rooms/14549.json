    "A slide of loose shale and rock, dotted with larger boulders, stems from a steep rocky wall and covers the eastern section of the leopard habitat.  Slightly muddy water runs in a wide arc around the exhibit, acting as a natural moat.  Sycamores and oaks spread their branches over the water, their roots securing the earthen river bank from further muddying the water."
