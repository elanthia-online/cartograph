    "This wooden bridge stretches over a pond filled with deep, clear water.  On the lilypads below, a few small frogs bask in the sun, occasionally hopping from one pad to another, as better spots become available.  A cat on the pond's edge watches this with intense interest.  Narrow wooden walkways lead off the bridge to the snug private homes on the shore.",
