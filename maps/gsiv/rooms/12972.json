    "The narrow path continues to spiral about the hill, ascending to the north above a dense thicket of thorny briars, and descending to the southwest among the hawthorn trees.  Mossy stones litter the grass, bedded down amongst thick patches of clover.  Below, the rooftops of homes, shops, and manor houses are silvered by the night and half-shrouded by the ever-present fog.",

Mossy stones litter the grass, bedded down amongst thick patches of clover.  Below, the rooftops of homes, shops, and manor houses glitter in the sunlight, damp with the residue of the ever-present fog."
