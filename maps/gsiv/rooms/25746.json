  "description": [
    "Glossy leaves of indigenous flora shimmer in the moonlight, with closed blossoms punctuating the dark green foliage.  The slender trees and larger greenery rise out of moist loam, while smaller plants reside in neatly tended beds and painted pottery.  Despite the man-made nature of the garden, the area retains a distinctly natural feel to it.  A cobbled path lined with a thin border of jade sea glass bisects the tropical oasis."
