    "This perfectly square room expands into the depths of the stone walls that surround it.  In the northern apex a recessed alcove is positioned above two folded wings cradling a perfectly formed crystal sphere.  Engraved above the alcove in detailed script are the words, \"With undying love, we commit you to memory.\"  Three massive tapestries line the remaining walls."
