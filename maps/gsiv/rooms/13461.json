    "The trail skirts the face of a bluff to the east, the rock striated with veins of color that are accented by the lacy green fronds of ferns clinging to outcroppings.  Pines have almost overtaken the deciduous trees, and the scent of pine sap mixes with the rich bouquet of mulch and leaves.  Frogs sing in the darkness, accompanied now and then by the hoot of owls.",

Birds dot the boughs with vivid splashes of red and blue, as well as the distinctive yellow of finches."
