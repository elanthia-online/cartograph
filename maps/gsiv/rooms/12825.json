    "Two young yew trees stretch their wiry, twisted limbs toward the sky, their thick, needled boughs casting tranquil shadows across the courtyard.  A faint chill hangs in the air here, and the surroundings appear oddly still, not a single sound of anything living breaking the silence of the garden.  A low-set grey granite building is built between the twin yew trees, its mute and solemn architecture broken only by the large arch allowing entry.",
