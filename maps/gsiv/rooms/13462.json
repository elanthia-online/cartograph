    "Trees and large rock formations force the trail to dogleg, heading toward a grouping of dwellings nestled in the trees to the north, and a bluff to the east.  Cottages sit between the stones, and some of the shadowy outcroppings tower over the roofs of the neighboring buildings.  Thick mounds of hostas and ferns crowd almost every nook and cranny possible, their beds eked out of the rocky landscape.",
