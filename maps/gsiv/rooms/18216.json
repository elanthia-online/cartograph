    "A beautiful crystal skylight provides the illumination to this cozy little bedroom and must provide an excellent view of the stars at night to anyone lying in the large, soft feather bed situated directly beneath it.  To one side sits an antique modwir nightstand accented in polished brass with a small mirror above.  A large, plush black bearskin rug takes up most of the remaining floorspace.",
