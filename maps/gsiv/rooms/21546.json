    "Suspended from bamboo frames, a series of dark velvet drapes encircles the small room and muffles most of the exterior noises.  Wide panels positioned in the ceiling are open to allow air to circulate through the area, while also allowing natural light to illuminate the room.  A black lacquered lattice is suspended from the conical ceiling and displays a variety of chain-strung wares, the lockets at their ends spinning lazily as customers move past.",
