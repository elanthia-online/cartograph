    "A gravel path approaches a majestic fountain to the south.  It is both large and masterfully carved, its marble figures lithe and graceful.  Dolphins soar through the spray of surf as the beautiful figures of sea nymphs cavort with them.  At certain points, larger figures surface above the tumult, their imposing stature marking points of observation around the impressive fountain."
