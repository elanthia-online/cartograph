    "Boxes and bags clutter every corner of this small back room.  A pine counter juts out from one wall, taking up most of the small amount of space remaining in the center of the room.  The air is redolent with the smell of ink and dust.  A wide canvas curtain covers the opening leading back to the front counter."
