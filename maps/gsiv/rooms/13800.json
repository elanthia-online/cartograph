  "description": [
    "Quaint houses are nestled against the hillside, their slate roofs complimenting the wild heather cloaking the slope.  A few large boulders jut out from the incline, the surfaces laced with a rich mantle of lichens.  One alder tree rises in the center of the circle of cottages, its branches thick with leaves and full with song from the birds residing in its protection."
