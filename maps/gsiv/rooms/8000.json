    "The cave ends abruptly with a sheer wall of basalt apparently thrust up through a fissure in the floor by a long ago and forgotten volcanic eruption.  Faint tool marks, rusted bits of broken tools and some small chips knocked out of the glass-smooth surface are the only evidence of attempts to pass here."
