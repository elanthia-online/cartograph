    "Cozy and warm, the common room has a circle of overstuffed leather armchairs and low couches arranged around an enormous stone-worked fireplace.  Rising from an opening in the rough modwir floor, the circular staircase pauses at a landing built against the wall before continuing to ring the room until it reaches a trapdoor positioned in the ceiling.  A door in the western wall leads into the barracks while a wide arch heads into the kitchen."
