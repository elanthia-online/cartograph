    "A large basin of clear water, fed by a stream trickling in from the northwest, has created a small clearing in the thick stand of trees.  The water ripples calmly, tendrils of mist rising from the surface and joining the larger hazy shroud in the treetops.  A single shaft of light has managed to pierce the fog, focusing its bright gaze upon the center of the pool.  An eerie silence dominates the small area, a stark contrast to the cacophony of noises that permeates the rest of this jungle."
