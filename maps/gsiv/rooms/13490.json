  "description": [
    "An open doorway dressed up with blue silk drapes lets into the building above the Cobbler's Shop, the oversized slipper nailed to the door proclaiming it as a related business.  Sheltered by the overhanging roofs of both buildings, the landing is a quiet refuge from the noise and crowds of the street below."
