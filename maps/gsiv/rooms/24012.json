    "Traffic flows around a row of stone benches that surrounds an expansive fire pit, while a large open-air pavilion sits snug against the walls of a limestone coliseum along the southern edge of the flagstone walkway.  Mature flowering plum trees line the northern edge of the walk, adding a soft fragrance and ample shade to the area."
