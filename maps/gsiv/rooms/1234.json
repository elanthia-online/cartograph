  "description": [
    "The steam rising from the baking moss hangs heavily in the valley.  The twisting, bramble-choked trail, impenetrable overhead foliage and clinging steam conspire to limit vision to a few shadowy yards at best.  To the northeast the trail slopes up, out of the valley, while to the southwest it plunges deeper into the damp mist."
