    "The perimeter road runs just inside the protective palisades that protect the north wall of the town, affording shelter from the prevailing winds off Darkstone Bay.  The weathered facades of businesses and warehouses line the road leading south into the center of Wehnimer's Landing.  To the east, the road leads to the riverfront, and the town's main gates lie farther to the west."
