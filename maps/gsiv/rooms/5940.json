    "Thick, clear slimy stuff covers both walls and floor in the room.  A strange green glow seems to emanate eerily from within the unknown substance which illuminates this chamber.  Peering closely within the green slime, the fossilized remains of insects are visible.  Stone steps leading to a balcony, with skulls carefully placed in each corner, stand at the back of this room."
