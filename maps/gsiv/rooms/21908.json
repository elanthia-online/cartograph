    "The large wagon is made of discolored wooden boards, each wall covered by various scorch marks and faded stains.  Yellow and green smoke lazily drifts up from small vials along a large shelf, joined by an assortment of alchemical tools.  The faint glimmer of gems twinkles inside of a banded oak barrel."
