    "Several small cottages line the street, their white-painted exteriors marred by streaks of soot and grime.  Across the wey from the cottages, a small shop has succumbed entirely to the fire, its sloped roop collapsed upon its demolished foundation.  Workers diligently pick through the rubble, while a number of guards watch over the area, eyes alert and weapons ready.",
    "Several small cottages line the street, most painted a clean white with a deep forest green trim.  Across the wey stands a large white limestone building with a flat, tiled roof.  The building boasts wide doulbe doors painted in a dark green hue, next to which is posted a small silver sign.  A tidy herb garden lines the front of the building beneath a row of wide windows.",
