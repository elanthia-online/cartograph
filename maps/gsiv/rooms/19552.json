    "Large and round, the shrine is built at the top of a tower and surrounded by an alternating pattern of limestone pillars and arching windows.  Rising from the heart of the room is the sculpted image of a blooming tree that houses a resplendent statue of Jaston.  Encircling the arboreal structure is a low altar that is pockmarked with bird's nests.  Dozens of birds have made this place their home, their soft song filling the air."
