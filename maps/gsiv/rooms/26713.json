    "Gilt-framed paintings of verdant islands and beaches sit pinned beneath a collapsed support beam, the waterlogged splinters stabbing through the fibrous canvas like splayed claws.  Against the opposite wall, a long side table has become a refuge for several crustaceans, the residents slowly cracking their claws at one another in a show of dominance."
