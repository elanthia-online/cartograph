    "A forest of great tropical trees stands between the volcano to the north and the ocean to the west and south.  The trees are mistwoods, with massive roots, smooth, wide trunks, and an interwoven network of branches that form an almost solid roof above.  A thick blanket of hot mist rolls down from the volcano, swirling over the moonlit ground as it meanders through the trees.",
