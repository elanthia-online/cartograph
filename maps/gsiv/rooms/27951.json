    "A pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the knotty oak-paneled walls, and a varnished golden oak ceiling rises overhead.  An elegantly dressed maiden statue sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on one side of the shop and an etched brass bin on the other."
