    "A wide field opens out to the northeast, filled with soft wet snow gently rolling over small hummocks unbroken by the ravages of the storms that cross the open lands near the Trace.  Residents have taken advantage of the generous snowfall to create elaborate snow sculptures that dot the expansive flats.  Some of the ersatz craftsmen have built basic snowmen, while others have made fantastic scenes of heroic knights battling magnificent dragons."
