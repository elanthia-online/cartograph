  "description": [
    "A sturdily constructed hut, the largest by far in the village, sits directly in the center hub of the surrounding pathways.  Its stacked-stone walls are mortared with mud and clay, and its roof is a conical configuration of white canvas.  An opening at the apex of the roof has clearly been configured to permit the escape of smoke from any fires built within.  A small vegetable garden beside the hut bears a few rows of corn, a smattering of cabbages, and a robust collection of weeds."
