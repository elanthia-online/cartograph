    "Deeper into the cave, the walls are a tad drier and set with several burning torches that reveal a rough carving of winged beasts towering over smaller figures holding spears in their hands.  Small niches are visible on both the east and west walls of the cave.  Burning mullein torches frame a jagged opening."
