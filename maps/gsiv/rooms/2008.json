    "A little brook flows down from the heights and wanders off to the west.  Although the bed is shallow, the brook widens as it passes beneath some willows encroaching to the west.  The water rushes quickly over the mossy stones, dampening the feet of weary travelers with a gentle caress.  The ever-present fog dances over the water's rippling surface, coalescing into swirling shapes in the murky darkness.",
