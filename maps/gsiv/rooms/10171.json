    "This shallow valley spreads west between the rise of two high hills then narrows into a tiny path that continues to the east.  Delicate wildflowers have taken advantage of the shade and protection of the surrounding stone walls, and have made the valley their own.  Purple, white and yellow petal blossoms mingle profusely on every side of the game trail that extends through the valley."
