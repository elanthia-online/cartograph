    "Stone stairs start out wide and even, then become more erratic and twisting back upon themselves in hairpin turns, traversing this passageway.  Each landing created by the snaking steps features a small wooden bench, and yet walls lit with bright oil torches are devoid of any art or tapestries.  A tiny cluster of silver bells is suspended from a small hook set into one of the bench arms."
