    "A shallow tidepool filled with an assortment of bizarre critters sits amidst a congregation of smooth round stones.  The crystal-clear water ripples softly, the tiny waves not seeming to bother the sea life within.  Along the bottom of the pond, a sea star slowly glides along, each of its five arms wildly different."
