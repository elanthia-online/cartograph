    "Scattered through the new growth of young tanik trees are the shattered trunks of older ones.  Massive stumps, charred and splintered, are visible among the young trees, mute evidence of some violent cataclysm.  A narrow trail around a scorched and cracked boulder leads up to a copse of birch trees."
