    "Smooth sandstone walls rise from a patterned hardwood floor.  Just above a verdant elderberry bush hangs a framed Ta'Illistim map, and a cerulean cloud-painted ceiling completes the picture.  A wide knotted oak counter and a heavy lead glass display case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
