    "A variety of dried herbs hangs from a sturdy maoral beam ceiling, their faint, subtle scents mingling with one another pleasantly.  A large empty bronze birdcage hangs in one corner of the smooth grey stone walls, a few stray feathers shifting within its confines from pleasant drafts of air flowing in from a linen-draped window.  An expansive circular fel table stands in the center of the varnished maoral plank floor, a linen-lined woven willow basket set atop it."
