    "Columnar panels of semi-transparent silk hang from the ceiling to just brush the floor with their rainbow of colors.  A long counter with a channel along the edges dominates the middle of the room, providing a work surface for coloring.  Leading to a back room, an arch opens in the wall behind the counter."
