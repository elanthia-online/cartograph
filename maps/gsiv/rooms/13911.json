    "The broad sweep of the limestone floor is interrupted by a thick off-white carpet.  Halfway to the white cedar ceiling, a fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  A white marble shelf and a beveled glass-covered case are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
