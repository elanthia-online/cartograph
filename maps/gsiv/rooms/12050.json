  "description": [
    "Trees sprout through cracked foundations, lifting and tumbling walls with their gnarled roots and expanding limbs -- belligerent invaders claiming squatter's rights in the abandoned ruins.  Drifts of leaves, piled deep through the passage of countless years, cram the cracks and crannies of the broken walls."
