    "Painted a uniform bright white hue, the small ferry is ringed by polished brass railings and has a smooth floor of interlocking teak and cedar boards.  Stretched across the stern is a grey-whorled purple awning that creates a small lounging area for guests and visitors.  Near a wide captain's wheel at the vessel's bow, a shell-shaped protective structure covers a ladder that leads downward."
