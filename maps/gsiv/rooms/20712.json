  "description": [
    "This long hall is carpeted by a dark, burgundy and gold rug that stretches from the hallway entrance at one end to a carved rosewood arch at the other.  Paintings of buildings in Ta'Vaalor hang on the cream-hued walls, illuminated by ensconced candles that flicker in the slightest breeze.  From the east, the scent of food emanates from a gold-edged ebonwood door, while from the west, the aroma of wine wafts in through an open doorway.  The scents mingle, creating an atmosphere of quiet opulence."
