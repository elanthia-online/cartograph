    "Staves, polearms, and other long, stick-like objects protrude from an old oak bin to lean against the rum-stained wall.  Treasures, trinkets, and trash glint inside a cracked porcelain basin, which has been carefully positioned to cover most of a rather suspicious-looking dark brown stain on the rug.  From the top of a rickety walnut coat rack, the unblinking yellow glass eyes of a molting stuffed owl stare at passing shoppers."
