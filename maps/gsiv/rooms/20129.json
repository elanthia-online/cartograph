    "Diffuse starlight filters down through the canopy overhead, dappling the grassy hillock at its base in shadows.  An open space around the foot of the tree is festooned with flags and rimmed with blazing torches.  Beyond the ring, the ground slopes away and down, bisected by paths cut through the ground-cover and into the moist earth.  Here and there the roots of the looming banyan force the trails to twist sharply, their protrusions forming inescapable obstacles of skyward-reaching wood."
