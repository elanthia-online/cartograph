    "The tent walls buldge inward slightly as their fabric is caught up in a passing breeze outside.  Colorful silk streamers criss-cross between the tent poles, ending in an elegantly knotted cascade of fabric just above a rotund mannequin and a flimsy stand.  A strong scent of fresh flowers from some unseen source nearby lingers in the air."
