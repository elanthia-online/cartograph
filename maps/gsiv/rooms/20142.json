    "Tall swamp grasses have been trampled flat, creating a small open field.  To either side of the clearing are long aisles separated by bales of hay, each one ending with a large painted target.  Several logs have been placed about the area, their surfaces cut with an indentation perfect for sitting.  A winding dirt path leads away from the gathering space, back towards the main festival area."
