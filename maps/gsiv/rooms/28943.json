    "Weblike tendrils of smoke weave between the multitude of telescopes that line the walls of the shop, leaving only the faint fragrance of petrichor to linger in the air.  Various glass lenses have been set up across the canvas-draped counters, the convex and concave domes angled to highlight the wares in the dimly lit room.  A long-haired grey cat lounges lazily upon an old velvet chaise at the back of the shop, occasionally scanning the room before returning his nap."
