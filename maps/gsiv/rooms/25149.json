    "Surrounding you is the apotheosis of all deserts, a wildly shifting sea of sands that swirl in pools of tawny and ruddy hue.  Sunlight pounds down from an open sky that is as blue as a jewel, reflecting in rippling waves off of the superheated grit.  Winds sweep down in stinging waves, blowing golden veils before them.",
    "Surrounding you is the apotheosis of all deserts, a wildly shifting sea of sands that swirl in pools of silver and shadow beneath the starlit sky.  Cold moonlight stretches its icy talons down from a sky as black as a bed of jeweler's velvet.  Frigid winds scream by in stinging waves, blowing veils of pallid grit before them."
