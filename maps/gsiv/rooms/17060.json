    "The rippling surface of the large central bath casts back the warm radiance of three glowing orbs high above, the colors of the ornately tiled walls dazzling in the bright light.  Low benches along the walls bear fat white silk cushions and an assortment of towels.  A smaller basin near the entrance holds cool water to refresh bathers as they leave the warmth of the main pool."
