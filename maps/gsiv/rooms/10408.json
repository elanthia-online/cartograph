    "Elaborate iron censers hang from the ceiling, casting a ruddy, dim glow over this portion of the hallway.  The pale marble farther down the hallway gives way here to immense black marble blocks flecked with silver.  Nearly hidden in the shadows, a chipped obsidian archway features a single silvery moonstone set into the apex of the curve."
