    "Melodic chimes dangle above the ash door, signaling the arrivals and departures from this cozy pawnshop.  Dangling above a polished white oak counter, a crooked plank has been decorated with a child's colorful beadwork that reads, \"Pawnshop.\"  A fringed curtain obscures an archway that leads to the rear of the shop."
