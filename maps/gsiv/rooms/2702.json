    "A wide split in the glacier is spanned by a bridge of rock and ice that shakes and shudders wildly whenever the frozen river shifts.  In the chasm far below the expanse, a slick floor strangely resembles an alpine toboggan run.  Towering cliffs to the south encourage travelers to find another way up the mountain."
