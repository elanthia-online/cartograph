    "Ribbed black willow walls rise from a dark-stained oak floor.  Just above a handblown double-heart bottle hangs a faded treasure map, and a varnished golden oak ceiling completes the picture.  A Vornavian silk-lined display case and a long mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
