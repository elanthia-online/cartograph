  "description": [
    "In this inner sanctum, an arched ceiling of wooden beams and clear panes of glass allows the natural sunlight to be filtered down to the wooden boxes filled with flowers and herbs at the edges of a carefully maintained lawn.  Three bronze statues - one light, one dark, and one taller than the others - stand on granite pedestals placed around the room.  Stone tables and benches are placed amongst urns filled with tall, leafy plants and shrubs."
