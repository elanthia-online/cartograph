    "This end of the rickety pier has been covered with a thick puma fur rug, creating a small seating area for a select group of customers.  Rolled up canvas openings create breezy windows, admitting the sounds of the nearby swamp critters infiltrate the space.  A tilted worktable sits at a slight angle in front of a heavy canvas curtain blocking off the very end of the structure."
