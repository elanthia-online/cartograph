    "Tendrils of silver mist snake across the landscape in undulating waves, obscuring the ground.  Appearing out of the massive growth of the garden is a large manor, its windows warm with cool white light that shines through the shadows cast by the canopy of the trees that dwarf it.  There is an otherworldly quality to the light of the garden; with its lack of direct moon- or sunlight, one is left to question if it is even they which illuminate this green and mist-filled world.",
    "Tendrils of silver mist snake across the landscape in undulating waves, obscuring the ground.  Appearing out of the massive growth of the garden is a large manor, painted the colors of an overcast sky, and permanently shadowed by the canopy of the trees that dwarf it.  There is an otherworldly quality to the light of the garden, with its lack of direct sunlight -- if it is even the sun that illuminates this green and mist-filled world."
