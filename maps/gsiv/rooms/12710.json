  "description": [
    "Sturdy pillars rise from the floor to support the ceiling above, forming an archway that leads to the south.  A pair of burnt tapestries flanks the archway, rusted iron poles and decimated cloth strips their only remnants.  Tiny grooves have been carved into the floor, and small streams of water flow gently through them to the east."
