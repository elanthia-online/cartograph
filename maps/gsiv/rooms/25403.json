    "The room is bare but for a long conference table and a number of chairs pushed under it while not in use.  Situated in the middle of the table is a map of Wehnimer's Landing and nearby environs.  Neatly lined up on one side of the map are a set of miniatures depicting Hendoran troops and potential enemies.  Near a small window rests an empty gilded birdcage."
