    "[Illustrated Tent]"

  "description": [
    "The tent is imprinted with colorfully exaggerated depictions of carnival acts.  Between elaborately scrollworked borders, a riot of tumblers, jugglers and dancers vies for space with actors, jesters and mimes.  In contrast to the gaudy figures, the lower border of the tent is frayed and threadbare.  A faint fetid odor of decomposition here nags the olfactories; it seems to originate from a corner of the tent occupied by a heavily trussed iron trunk strapped with bolted chains."
