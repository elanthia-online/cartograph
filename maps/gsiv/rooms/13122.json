    "Baking coves line the eastern walls of the kitchen above three hearths, two of which are banked for the night, while a third houses the morning's porridge.  Several bakers work white-washed preparation tables, kneading and mixing the next day's bread as they quietly converse.  Neatly dividing the cooking area from the dining room is a bird's-eye maple serving table with several dishes still upon it for late night visitors.",
