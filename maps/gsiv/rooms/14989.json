    "Grey watered silk walls rise from a glossy black ebonwood floor.  Just above some puffed raw silk pillows hangs a painted silk wall panel, and a low skylight-set ceiling completes the picture.  Some carved haon pegs and a iron-bound ebonwood chest stand side by side in the middle of the room."
