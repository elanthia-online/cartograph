    "[Miasmic Verge, Outer Swamp]"

  "description": [
    "Tumbled stones, blocky and chipped, lie in a scattered heap along the sloping edge of the swamp and provide a durable barrier that keeps the sludge-covered watercourse at bay.  Drooping willow trees, short and stunted, drape across the path and dangle their spear-shaped leaves upon the spongy ground.  A tangled vine, riddled with thorns, rest in a knotted cluster around a thick growth of bright purple swamp thistle."
