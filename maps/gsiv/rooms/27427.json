    "The dimly-lit, expansive interior of this tent is centered around a large tent pole.  Dark gold tapestries depicting people being run through with various implements drape the length of the walls.  Several sanguine velvet benches are clustered together for an audience on one side of the tent, while the other side is open with a carpeted floor.  A single bright lantern illuminates a giant-sized board bearing numerous puncture holes that has been propped up to face the benches."
