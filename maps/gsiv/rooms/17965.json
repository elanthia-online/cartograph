  "description": [
    "The courtyard widens into an irregularly-shaped ground, bounded by the uneven back walls of the buildings to the north and south.  The ground is soft, and covered with a layer of snow and mud and the tracks of hundreds of passing boots.  The building to the west, unlike the others, seems to have been built facing in on the courtyard, and its small door is guarded by a pair of neatly-trimmed fir trees."
