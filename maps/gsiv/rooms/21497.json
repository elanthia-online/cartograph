    "The walls here are sparsely decorated with ragged ribbons and the tattered remains of some sort of flag.  A soiled basket rests in a corner directly below a row of crooked old nails protruding from the wall.  In the center of the room is a large padded post.  A dowel has been affixed horizontally towards the top of the assemblage, and above that is a round sand-filled bag which droops forward giving the structure a scarecrow-like appearance.  Hung crookedly on its hinges, a warped door leads into a dimly lit room."
