    "The rock-strewn floor of the canyon is cluttered with broken shale, small pieces of gravel, and larger, man-sized stones.  Although many of the smaller stones have long ago been blown away by the raging winds, some pockets of collected dust and sand lie trapped amid the larger rocks.  These few, infrequent deposits are home to small clusters of grass and tiny shrubs, which eke out a living in this sparse region.  The seemingly ill-placed sound of trickling water can be heard from the south."
