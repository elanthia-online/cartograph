  "description": [
    "The interior of the hut is stark and poorly furnished.  A large bronze cooking pot stands in a corner, the walls surrounding it blackened by wood smoke.  A few simple chairs and a round table, all made from ringed sections of tree trunks, are the only other items in the one-room hovel."
