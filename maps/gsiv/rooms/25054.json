    "Occupants of the camp have hung woven lattices of thick bloodied rope that drape from wagons and tree branches, the webwork strung with a variety of hand-carved fetishes.  Feathers, claws, and painted skins dangle along the lengths of hemp, the wards left unscathed despite the blackened ground beneath them.  Wisps of smoke rise high from the south, dancing away on the errant breeze."
