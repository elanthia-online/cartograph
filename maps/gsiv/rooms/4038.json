    "The courtyard evokes a serenity and harmony that express the essence of nature.  With its carefully styled plants and judiciously placed stones, the courtyard is a tribute to the beauty of pure form.  At the north end of the courtyard large gated doors lead to the Hall of Patrons rising behind its corbelled facade."
