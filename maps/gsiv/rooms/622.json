  "description": [
    "A few stray notes of flute music drift along through the cool night air, perhaps coming from one of the lighted windows of the cottages that line the var.  The silvery grey cobblestones give off a subtle glow as the soft moonlight reflects off flecks of quartz crystal embedded within the rock.",
    "A small crowd has gathered around a street performer, who sits in the center of the var playing a flute.  His repertoire includes a seemingly infinite variety of styles and moods, which he weaves together in a subtle tapestry of song.  A little dog wearing a silver conical hat moves in concert with the music, marching in time to martial strains or swaying in place to more sentimental airs.",
    "The back of Ta'Illistim Keep casts a metaphorical shadow over the tiny gardens and blue-tiled roofs of the homes that line the var.  Next to it, even the largest of the villas in the affluent neighborhood appears small, dwarfed by the Keep's multiple domes and sweeping mosaics."
