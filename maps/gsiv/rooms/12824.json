    "A long counter inlaid with polished seashells divides the room, creating small waiting areas dotted with comfortable-looking armchairs.  On the far side of the counter, a few desks groan under piles of unfiled papers.  The walls are hung with portraits of finely dressed gentlemen and ladies, the wealthy burghers whose industry built Solhaven to its current prominence."
