    "A light veil of snow covers the flowering heaths and willows of the guild courtyard, except for a few small patches located underneath the protective overhanging branches of some fel trees.  In these patches, the sedges peek out to seek the rejuvenation of the day's sun.  A carefully swept stone path leads from the main gate towards a columnar complex with walls formed from megalithic slabs of black rock."
