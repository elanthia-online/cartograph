    "Woven tapestries adorn the walls, depicting the intense, red lava flows deep beneath the earth and the windy, icy peaks of the DragonSpine.  Within the northeast corner of this tidy office, a full runestave rack has been draped with an embroidered canvas.  Neatly bundled scrolls lie in a wire basket alongside blank pieces of parchment and an inkwell on a gold-flecked blue marble desk."
