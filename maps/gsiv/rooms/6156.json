    "Jagged rocks jut out at various angles from the cliffs of the Upper Krag Slopes to the east.  A ruined stone walkway travels along the base of the mountain, strangled at times by large patches of dead or dying grass.  A large marble structure breaks the skyline to the west, dilapidated from years of neglect."
