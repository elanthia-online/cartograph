    "Standing guard like silent sentinels, moss-covered trees hold their decaying branches protectively over holes left in their trunks.  Thick shrouds of white cobwebs span the gaps between the branches, their dense forms glistening in the rays of sunlight filtering through the canopy.  A few of the large webs have broken off from their wooden anchors, swaying slowly from their lofty perch like ghosts.",
