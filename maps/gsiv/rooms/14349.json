  "description": [
    "Dark paneled walls along the western side of the hallway provide a striking contrast to the huge marble statue to the east.  The scarlet carpeting is worn in several places, showing the scuffed wooden floorboards underneath.  A blue velvet drape cleverly conceals an alcove across from the statue and some long red silk curtains offer passage to the south, back to the inn proper."
