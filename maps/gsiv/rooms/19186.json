    "The crowded nature of this small dark paneled nook is exacerbated by a claw-footed large wooden table taking up most of the floor space, while several spindly protruding wood poles extend perpendicular out of the wall opposite the table.  Larger bags dangle from the poles, while the table is laden with rows of smaller pouches and purses.  A two-toned blue jute runner leads south to the foyer."
