    "The silent sentinels gaze blankly across the boiling chamber, steamy sweat pouring down their brows and pooling about their wide, glistening feet.  The southern wall of the chamber is slick with water, and a thin white cloud billows across the roof, sharp drops of scalding rain sizzling on the floor in every direction."
