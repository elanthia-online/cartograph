    "Mossy banks line both sides of the bubbling stream that disappears into a pile of stones near the graveyard wall, connected by a small stone footbridge.  Willows sway in the slight breeze, forming a canopy of leaves over the bridge, and several small homes are set in the cool shadows among the trees."
