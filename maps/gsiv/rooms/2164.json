  "description": [
    "Trails radiate from the base of a large megalith of glaes.  Its surface is pitted and scarred from the assault of lava eruptions, and its shape is irregular.  Stunted shoots protrude from its column, reaching in all directions like misshapen limbs.  The confluence of trails stops abruptly at the formation's foot, as if designating it the destination of all journeys upon the plateau."
