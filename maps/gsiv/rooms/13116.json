    "Framed on three of four sides by wide open windows, the tower is bare of all furnishings and connected to the rest of the building by a thin corridor leading east and wide plank stairs leading down.  Each window provides a vantage point for a different area around the building and has shutters wrapped around them that can be pulled tight for protective shielding.  A thin pipe collects water from the roof and deposits it into a copper-banded oak barrel at the center of the room."
