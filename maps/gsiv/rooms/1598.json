    "An overbearing triple-turreted fane rises up on the north side of the avenue and sits well back from the road on a small hillock, giving it a bit of elevation above the other buildings along this passage.  Surrounded by a tall ironwork fence, an opening at the foot of a path leads up to a darkened entry.  A massive crimson glaes arch of flames illuminates the area with its wavering, lurid glow."
