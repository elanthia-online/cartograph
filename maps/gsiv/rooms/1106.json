  "description": [
    "Above, the trail reaches the cliff's summit, while below it continues downward in a switchback to the low mountain range.  The cliff sides are hard and unyielding, as if this tower of rock had been thrust upward from the earth by some gigantic hand.  Sweat from the journey's exertion evaporates quickly in the dry conditions, making the climb more bearable in that respect, but the arid conditions counter this benefit by producing parched throats and rapid dehydration.  Nothing stirs along the trail."
