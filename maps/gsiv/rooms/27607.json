    "Upon first glance, this workshop hardly looks like an appropriate place to do clothing alterations.  Coffins in various states of repair are draped across saw horses, and a thick layer of sawdust covers the floor.  On top of the coffins, however, are clothing patterns and fabrics tacked onto the wood for easier cutting and stitching.  Coffin lids have been fashioned into some makeshift benches.  A dark doorway leads back to the showroom floor."
