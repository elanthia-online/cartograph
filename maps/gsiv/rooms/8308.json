    "You come upon the northern edge of the clearing.  Dense underbrush and closely-spaced pine form an unpenetrable barrier to the north.  The shadowy presence of the black obsidian dome dominates your view, even here.  The area also is the northernmost outpost of the cluster of huts, with one lying to the side of the path's end."
