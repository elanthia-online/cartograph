    "Within the ring of massive stone pillars that comprise this courtyard, the air is unnaturally calm and the atmosphere serene.  Fenvaoks, normally seen at much lower altitudes, flit through the air, chirping merrily.  Small shrubs form a ring inside the pillars, and a lush carpet of grass fills the area.  Lining a series of spoke-like pebbled paths, each bracketed by wrought iron benches, rows of flowers extend from the courtyard to the triskele building at the circle's hub."
