    "A stiff breeze carries the faint scent of Darkstone Bay over the high basalt walls into this small, secluded yard.  Several low marble benches are scattered here and there, and a heavy iron portcullis leads to the interior of the prison.  A slender stone path leads out of the courtyard and back to the crowded streets."
