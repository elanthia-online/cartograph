    "Pale blue-washed walls and minimal decor lend an air of serenity to the expansive room.  Raised on a pallid oak platform in the corner, is a large canopied bed draped with gossamer white curtains which match those billowing at a partially open window.  A soft light emanates from a myriad of glowing sea glass globes hanging on gilt chains from the oak beamed ceiling.  The centerpiece of the room is a low glass-topped table, around which heaps of pale cushions are scattered."
