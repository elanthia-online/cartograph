    "Owls in unseen perches high in the trees hoot at travelers on the path who fumble along in the darkness.  Piles of fallen branches have been pushed to the sides of the path, indicating regular upkeep of the path.  The air here is still and hot, as if it had not been stirred by breeze in years."
