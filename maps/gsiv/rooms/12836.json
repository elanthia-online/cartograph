    "Blackened cobblestones curve sharply around the silver-veined marble walls surrounding this enclave defended by two armed warriors.  Onlookers pause to stare through an elaborate gate only to be hurried along by the menacing guards.  It is not entirely clear if the guards are there to keep the onlookers out or to keep someone inside the walled inclosure.  Behind the gate, a spired palace rises majestically toward the sky."
