    "Sky blue linens create a gentle swirl of color across the high ceiling, only to be bound in place by lacquered bamboo walls.  Soft illumination filters through the room from a gold-wrapped frosted orb suspended at the center of the room.  Framed by a pair of agate-inlaid vases, filled with fragrant white magnolia and orange blossoms, is a low table surrounded by cushions.  Mounted to one wall, a framed linen robe is artistically displayed behind a pane of protective glass."
