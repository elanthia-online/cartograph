    "Silvery moonlight filters through the three portal windows which dot one side of this long, narrow space, falling on the crystal balls displayed on a shallow velvet-lined shelf running the length of the wagon below the windows.  A dimly lit chandelier hangs overhead, casting flickering light and long shadows over the area.  A glass-fronted dark wood wardrobe takes up most of the back wall, save for the space occupied by a crimson velvet drape.",
