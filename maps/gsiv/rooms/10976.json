  "description": [
    "A gentle breeze wafts across verdant green fields, rustling the tall grass and wildflowers, wending its way across the landscape.  Several carefully constructed residences back up onto the picturesque expanse, enfolded by a long grassy knoll.  A lazy river winds through the field, feeding a stand of whispering willows that crowd the banks as if in search of a cooler spot on a hot sunny day."
