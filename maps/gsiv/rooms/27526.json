  "description": [
    "Utterly square, the perimeter of the room has been lined with shelving.  Resting on each shelf is an array of glittering jewels.  A table near the rear of the room holds a silver jewelry tree that displays a variety of wearables.  A crystalline globe in the ceiling emits a fractured light that sends a rainbow of colors across the surfaces.  A soft, woven rug adorns the floor and leads from the front entrance to a doorway in the back."
