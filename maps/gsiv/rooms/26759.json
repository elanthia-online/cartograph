    "Constructed from reclaimed wood, the table is bound by a continuous band of sturdy invar to hold the planks of the top together, while the legs are held by brackets of the same material.  Though obviously old and repurposed, the wood has been well-treated, having been sanded smooth and coated in a layer of thick lacquer."
