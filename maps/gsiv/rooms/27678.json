  "description": [
    "The sound of trickling water provides a bit of background noise echoing throughout the entrance to this wing, though its source is unseen.  In the exact center of the spacious, roughly triangular room is a towering tangle of iceblossoms, the native Icemulian flowers' aroma sporadically wafting about.  Across from a stout cedar and oaken door leading to a large conference room is a hazy oval watercolor painting.  A sleepy halfling guard watches over the area despite a prima facie lack of alertness."
