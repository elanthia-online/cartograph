    "A group of beehives sits on the hillside, each one surrounded by a peppery-looking cloud of bees hovering around it.  Two or three halflings toddle back and forth tending the apiary, wearing netted headgear to protect them from their charges.  A small grove of aspen trees grows behind the hives, their swaying branches lending a dappled pattern to the supers."
