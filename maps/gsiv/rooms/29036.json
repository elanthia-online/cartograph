  "description": [
    "Coils of rope and discarded buoys spill out of a large oak barrel that rests upon the smooth boards of the pier, the container positioned beneath a large white sign that reads \"Pier 1 - Slips 6-10.\"  Several steps lead down to a finger pier that has docking slips in it, each lined with cork buffer pads.  A gentle breeze filters through the air and carries with it the salty scent of the sea."
