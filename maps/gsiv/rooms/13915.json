    "A fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of the wooden floor.  There is a series of low oak shelves on one side of the shop and a plank-covered barrel table on the other."
