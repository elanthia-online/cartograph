    "Swathes of elven, dwarven and human hides decorate the walls of this establishment like macabre tapestries.  A narrow bar shaped out of a giant ribcage stretches across the room, its top set with bleached bone plates as a makeshift counter.  Behind the bar roams an eyeless giantman zombie, spilling more drinks than filling them.  A row of hide-covered wooden stools provide a place to rest and drink."
