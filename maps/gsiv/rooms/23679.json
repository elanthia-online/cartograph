  "description": [
    "Standing back against the jungle hedge is a large indigo and gold canvas pavilion, a pair of spiraling topiaries to either side of the opening.  Several balsawood trees tower above, shading the area, and moving slightly when an errant breeze catches the branches.  Ropes of flower laden vines cascade down the side of the hall and over an out cropping of rock nestles against its wall."
