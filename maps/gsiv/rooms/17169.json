    "Pale lilac curtains are tied back to display half a dozen identical flowerpots, which rest on the ledge of the bay window.  Each pot overflows with beautiful specimens of bluebells, dragonstalks, and other flora.  A watering can is in the corner of the window, partially hidden by the curtains.  A small writing table serves as a desk for the foreman of the place."
