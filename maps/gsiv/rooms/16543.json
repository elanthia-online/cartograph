    "The broad sweep of the sea glass floor is interrupted by a captured princess statue.  Halfway to the seaglass ceiling, a faded treasure map hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls.  An oversized sea chest and a wide knotted oak counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
