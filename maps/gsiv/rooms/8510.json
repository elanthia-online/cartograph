  "description": [
    "Here stand more trees.  One has had a stone ring built around it that apparently sinks down deep into the ground and choked the roots to death.  Another shows signs of insect infestation.  Perhaps some swarm of beetles was let loose to feed on its sap like fleas on the blood of animals.  Again, each tree has an altar before it."
