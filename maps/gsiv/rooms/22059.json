    "An enormous antique armoire takes up much of one wall.  Nearby is a mirrored vanity table and a matching chair.  An elegant black-laquered four-poster bed, dramatically draped in swathes of crimson silk, fills one corner of the room.  A five-panelled silk screen sections off the back right corner of the room."
