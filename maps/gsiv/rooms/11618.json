  "description": [
    "A creek bisects the old road.  The ribs of a fallen bridge are visible through the fog, its rotting timbers now mired below in the turgid creek they once spanned.  The neatly trimmed trunk of a felled tree now spans the creek.  Tall, greasy weeds and scrub brush line the northern side of the road."
