    "Disturbing the sweet harmony of life in the valley, some of the trees in the hills above creak out a discordant dirge.  A taste of rotting fel wafts past you, only to be buried in the sweet smell of the wildflower patches you are tromping through.  The wildflowers provide a welcome dash of color as you hack your way through the deep green of the valley."
