  "description": [
    "Arranged in tidy rows, vegetable gardens housed in sunken planter boxes dominate the southern slope as it gradually dips to the rocky shoal below.  A narrow winding trail follows along a cultivated path that leads to a small fishing pier and shack, while across the cobblestone road a wide-windowed coral-hued villa is surrounded by wandering chickens and geese.  The distant sound of bleating and mooing can be heard from beyond the structure, though the actual source is obscured from sight."
