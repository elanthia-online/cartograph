  "description": [
    "Centered in the light oak floor is an exquisite circular mosaic of colorful sea glass.  A large ship's wheel hangs from the ceiling, illuminating the foyer with frosted glass globes suspended from copper chains.  To one side of the stained glass doors stands a hall tree displaying several hats of various styles.  The model of a large sailing ship rests on the floor between a velvet-draped archway and a curved ocean blue doorway that lead deeper into the manor."
