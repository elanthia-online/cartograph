  "description": [
    "Gigantic toadstools rest in stone pots every twenty feet or so.  The trunks of the toadstools are a bright opaque white and quite thick, reaching up to support a flaring cap.  It is the cap that is of use in the dark mine.  The underside of the cap glows a luminescent white, casting its light to the tunnel floor in a white circle.  The topside of the cap, however, casts a light silver illumination and gives the ceiling a silvery sheen all along the tunnel."
