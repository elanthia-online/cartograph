    "This small space is cramped, with props and scenery piled in haphazard stacks on either side of a narrow walkway.  The rope for the curtain stretches from ceiling to floor near the light switches, the pulleys glisten with oil to avoid squeaking, and the wooden lever is buffed smooth.  Providing access to the stage are two arches, while at the back of the room, a wooden stage door leads out to the hallway."
