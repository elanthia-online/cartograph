    "Dipping into an enormous basin, the park is built within a crater and surrounded by concentric bands of stepping stones and an emerald green lawn.  Rising out of the smooth bottom are a trio of enormous palm trees, surrounded by brightly blooming passionflower bushes.  Moving quietly through the area, a lone janitor cleans up the refuse of the previous day and whistles a quiet tune."
