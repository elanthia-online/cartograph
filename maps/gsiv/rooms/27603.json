  "description": [
    "This room has been turned into an obvious office space with stiff, cream-colored canvas walls, and a large oak desk that dominates the far corner.  The triangular space is brightly lit and smells faintly of cheap cologne.  Two of the three walls have been used to showcase a collection of items; one features a large collage, and the other an ostentatious display of accreditation.  Stools have been strewn about in a disorganized manner."
