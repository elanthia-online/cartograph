  "description": [
    "A large yet simple bed set upon a stout wood frame is flanked by small night tables that grace each side, here in the Captain's cabin.  A giant silver wheel is hanging on one wall and looks to be authentic.  Unlike the other cabins, this one has a fairly large porthole that allows the daylight to enter and provides a very nice view of the ocean.",
