    "An embroidered grey wool curtain has been drawn back from the east wall to reveal a large alcove.  The recessed area is illuminated by an antique iron candelabra set with thick indigo pillar candles.  Bathed in the warm radiance of candlelight is an array of holy wares that sit on display upon a glossy green marble-topped table."
