    "The shadows of damselflies, fireflies, and dragonflies dance across the ceiling, their images created by the decorative cuts in the bodies of the lanterns that are strung in a straight line down the hall.  Large vases, housing exotic flowers, stand upon either sides of a paneled white birch door and an ornate haon door, while a rich plum carpet muffles all sound and keeps the passage quiet."
