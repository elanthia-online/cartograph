    "Midnight blue canvas stretched across the wagon's four walls is supported by slender bamboo reeds to create a domed ceiling that is painted with silver and gold stars.  Tiny glass shards, each dangling from a different support, depict the various constellations of the Northern Skies and twinkle lightly in the light of several nearby candles.  A narrow cot rests beside a pot-bellied stove at the rear of the wagon, while a rocking chair rests beside a small ebonwood display counter."
