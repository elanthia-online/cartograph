  "description": [
    "In the midst of these dark firs stands a lone oak tree, its hefty branches muscling nearby trees aside.  An owlet peeks curiously out of the large hole high up in the oak trunk -- big, round eyes gleaming with a green-yellow brilliance.  A solitary hoot echoes through the woods every so often, the melancholy sound adding to the already gloomy atmosphere."
