    "Glass-paned lanterns hang from iron hooks along the wall.  A long hand-carved sideboard rests near a group of large tables.  Rows of haon plank benches rest in front of every table, their wooden structures supported by iron-banded barrels.  A thin dusting of bleached yellow straw covers the hard-packed earthen floor of the tavern."
