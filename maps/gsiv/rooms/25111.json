    "A row of gold-framed windows are set into wide cubbyholes, each draped with gold-embroidered crimson velvet curtains.  In front of each window is a wilted flower in a ceramic vase bearing the crest of Reim.  Overhead, a diamond-crusted chandelier hangs dangerously low, with a small ladder next to it."
