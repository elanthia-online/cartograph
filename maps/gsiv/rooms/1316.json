    "The stars and moons are reflected in the still lake that is west of the trail.  The water is as dark as the sky, beautifully setting off the reflected clouds.  Sitting on a partially submerged rock, a bullfrog basks in the starlight.",
    "Clouds scudding across the sky are reflected in the still lake that is west of the trail.  The water is the same brilliant shade of blue as the sky, set off beautifully by the intense white clouds.  Sitting on a partially submerged rock, a turtle basks in the sun."
