  "description": [
    "In the center of this well lit area sits a small shrine.  Frosted globe lanterns line the walls, casting a soft glow over a long wooden counter, and the scent of burning candles fills the air.  A small gilded case rests atop a stone pedestal standing in one corner next to a large wicker basket.  Covering the floor is a well-worn black carpet edged with two thin white stripes."
