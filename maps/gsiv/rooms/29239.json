  "description": [
    "Stands of immature firs, spreading hemlocks, and stately pines are staggered throughout the open space.  A carpet of browning needles cushions the ground underfoot, and the husks of deceased beetles lend an iridescence to many of the standing trunks.  Downward draping boughs lightly kiss the tops of the waving grasses at their feet."
