  "description": [
    "As your eyes follow a cobblestone footpath into the trees, a small cottage is nestled snugly, barely discernible, among the foliage.  The vegetation grows so close to the building that it seems to be a part of it.  Flowers and vines cover the walls and roof, yet they grow in such a way that neither the wooden door nor the windows are blocked."
