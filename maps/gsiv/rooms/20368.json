    "The passage is almost completely dark, only illuminated by the light from the candles that filters in through the mouth of the tunnel.  A faint trickle of water can be heard from somewhere in the back of the room, the sound reverberating in the small space.  Just within the dim pool of light, a slatted wooden crate rests on its side, its contents threatening to spill out onto the stone floor."
