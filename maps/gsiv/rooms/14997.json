    "This is the fermentation room of the brewery.  Old oaken vats banded with iron form two rows with narrow aisles along both walls.  Brewers weave between them, climbing up short stepladders to take samples or add ingredients.  Full casks filled of aged ale and beer awaiting transport stand by the mouth of a corridor."
