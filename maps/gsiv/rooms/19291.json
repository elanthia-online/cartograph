  "description": [
    "The vines clinging to the sides of the wooden gazebo are thick enough to enclose the gazebo in soft shadows.  Faint illumination falls through the living lattice, creating a dappled pattern of moonlight on the wooden plank floor that is lighter than the darkness cloaking a bench running the circumference of the walls.  Night sounds of crickets in the ivy serenade the intimate enclosure.",
    "The vines clinging to the sides of the wooden gazebo are thick enough to shade the enclosure from the sun's heat while yielding an appealing dappled pattern of light on the wooden plank floor.  The interior is cool and secluded, and a bench runs around the seven walls opposite the entrance."
