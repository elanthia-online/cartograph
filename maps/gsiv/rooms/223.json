    "Vigilant night guardsmen scrutinize the citizens and travelers arriving and departing through the wide gateway spanning the land route into Wehnimer's Landing.  The cluttered streets of the city to the south are a far cry from the deceptively calm expanse of the wilds of Elanith outside.  Two daunting towers survey the countryside and protect the town, flanking the road to the east and west.",
