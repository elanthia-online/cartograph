    "Hunched in front of a low stone wall, a tubby old dwarf hawks his wares.  The sign says \"Fresh Rabbit,\" but the lumps of meat on the spit look to be neither of those.  On the opposite side of the street, a mud-caked elf snores fitfully against an old crate, clutching a bottle with a distant, dreamy smile."
