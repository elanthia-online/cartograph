    "[White Marble Table]"

  "description": [
    "The square marble table's top matches perfectly with the marble in the second tier of the huge fountain that looms to the northeast.  Thin golden strands course through the white marble, causing the surface to sparkle in the light.  The table's top has been buffed to a fine sheen, and the edges and supports are exactly chiseled.  The table's grey-and-white umbrella is closed, allowing a breathtaking view of the constellation-filled night sky.  A freestanding torch flickers brightly nearby."
