    "The oak-paneled walls are hung with garlands of autumn leaves and pinecones in colors of red and orange and yellow and brown.  Hangings of dried corn and flowers adorn the small stone fireplace which warms the room with its flickering light, and beeswax candles glow merrily among the goods arranged on a carved oaken table."
