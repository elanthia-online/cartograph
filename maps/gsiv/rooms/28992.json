    "Thick cobblestones stretch across the floor, while heavy blocks form the walls and climb towards a rough oak ceiling.  Heavy support posts stand out in each of the corners and also flank the doorways that lead deeper into the structure.  A wrought iron chandelier provides illumination for a cannon merchant that roams about the room providing assistance to various consumers."
