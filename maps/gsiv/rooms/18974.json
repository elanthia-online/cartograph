    "Concentric rings of muted color ripple inward from the walls, compressing to a point in the center of the room before disappearing.  Hovering around a foot off the ground, a block of an unknown, matte black substance provides a stable work surface.  Overhead, a narrow skylight allows a spear point of natural light to enter the workroom and scatter into dazzling motes when it hits the floating workbench, illuminating a striated glass alembic, a crucible, and a platinum gem lens assembly."
