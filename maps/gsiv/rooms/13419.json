  "description": [
    "The frozen visage of a beautiful elven woman lies just beyond the threshold of the ivy-twined gates to the south, the statue nearly enveloped in the verdant creepers.  Black orchids nestle among the roots of several young maple trees, their sweet scent drifting through the surroundings with every faint breeze.  The cobblestoned walkway breaks off toward the south, leading towards the barred entryway to the back of the manor."
