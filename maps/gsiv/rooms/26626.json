    "The color scheme of the haberdashery is reversed from the boutique, the walls paneled in rich ebon fel and the floors tiled in vibrant green malachite and jade.  The broad side wall is stacked with scroll-carved black willow shelves situated over a divided walnut chest.  Spherical crystal-domed lamps brighten a glass-inset ironwood case that rests next to a sleek marble archway.",
