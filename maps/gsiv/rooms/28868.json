  "description": [
    "Ornate doors of heavy bronze muffle sounds from outside of the chapel, a long chamber with a low maple ceiling that has fanciful patterns of leaves and rosettes carved into its surface.  Framed on either side by pews of sturdy spruce, a walk proceeds to the east.  A thickly balustraded stair along the northern wall spirals up into a small loft."
