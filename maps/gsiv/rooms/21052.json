    "Amid the fluttering of several stray hummingbirds, patterns of light and dark fleck the ground where the moonlight is able to penetrate the profusion of heavily branched trees.  Thin blades of blue line almost every inch of the trees and ground where thousands of butterflies rest beneath the humid air.  Delicate blossoms have twisted closed, waiting for the warmth and light of day to awaken them as others bloom vibrantly in the slightly cooler night air."
