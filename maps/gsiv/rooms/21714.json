    "A huge gap yawns before you, the wall between here and the northwestern tower having completely collapsed.  Thirty feet below, the large sections of the wall lay imbedded in the soft earth of the courtyard.  Pieces of the wall continue to crumble at the slightest touch, and any further progress west is impossible."
