    "Small and cozy, this petite wedding chapel has served for many intimate celebrations of love.  Vases profuse with flowers stand to either side of the round white alabaster altar lightly streaked with rusty veins.  Carved into the shape of a kneeling pegasus with its head bowed and wings almost flat, the smooth stone serves as a surface upon which ceremonial items can be placed.  Thin ledges about midway along the walls are lined with white candles that contribute their soft lighting."
