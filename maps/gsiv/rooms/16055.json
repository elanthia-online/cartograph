    "Wrought iron chandeliers dangle frosted globes throughout the area, the brightly glowing orbs providing ample illumination for the wandering shopper.  Tidy racks, all perfectly dusted and neatly arranged, line the left hand wall of the shop, while the right has been left clear to allow for ease of movement.  Parchments decorate the sides of each rack and describe the various wares housed upon their shelves."
