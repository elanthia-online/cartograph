    "The northern end of the Great Hall has been set up as an auditorium of sorts.  A roughly hewn podium stands a giantman's length away from an enormous stone fireplace, while dozens of benches are scattered around to the sides of the room.  A hunting horn made out of a polished mammoth tusk is fastened above the mantle."
