    "A small group of owl butterflies gathers upon the low-laying fronds of moriche palms, the pineapple-shaped red fruit born of the trees dangling in abundance from the joints of each frond.  Large clusters of tall grass impede passage between the palms and the assortment of vine-laden trees crowding for space in the jungle, while the rustling movement of local wildlife echoes in the dense surroundings."
