    "An unruly flock of birds circles the center of this island where a soaring keep protrudes from the tree line.  Seemingly chiseled from a columnar rock formation, the solitary tower is actually formed of precisely-cut stone blocks set by masterful hands.  Half a dozen windowed turrets and several open landings emerge from the tower's smooth walls below an onion-domed peak.  Heedless of the obelisk, the river continues its inexorable journey south and east, swirling lazily round the island's graveled shore."
