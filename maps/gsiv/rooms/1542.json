    "Weathered flagstones stretch along the causeway, leading out from the mainland to this tiny isle set with an opal-like jewel of a temple, doors open and awaiting.  Close to the isle, sidings of openwork blued steel create an ornate lattice to keep visitors from falling into the water below.  Every few steps, a silver dolphin is set within a circle, above which sits a glaes-covered oil lamp lighting the way.",

Close to the isle, sidings of openwork blued steel create an ornate lattice to keep visitors from falling into the water below.  Every few steps, a silver dolphin is set within a circle, above which sits a dormant glaes-covered oil lamp, snuffed during daytime."
