    "Weathered flagstones stretch along the causeway, leading out from the mainland to this tiny isle set with an opal-like jewel of a temple, doors open and awaiting.  Close to the isle, sidings of openwork blued steel create an ornate lattice to keep visitors from falling into the water below.  Every few steps, a silver dolphin is set within a circle, above which sits a glaes-covered oil lamp lighting the way.",
