    "Placed to the side of the entrance, a suit of plate armor stands guard, while on the opposite side, a small gold plaque is affixed to the wall.  Hanging from bronze chains, a chandelier holds dozens of lit candles, their flickering lights illuminating the granite floor and the sandwich-board sign resting on it.  The room splits in two northerly directions, with short hallways that lead deeper into the structure, and between them a narrow flight of stairs heads up to the next floor."
