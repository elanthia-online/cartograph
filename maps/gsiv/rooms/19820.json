    "Mute grey silk swaths span the lengths of the marble columns in this hall, hiding the sheer white splendor of the surrounding architecture beneath layers of tranquil grey.  Stylized designs of polished moonstone arc across the floor, their sharp angles and dramatic curves weaving an almost crazed, yet beautiful pattern across the stone.  A soft, dim luminescence flickers in from the east, casting a pale, unearthly light across the hall."
