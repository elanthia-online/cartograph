    "Plush carpeting in a burnt sienna hue muffles the footsteps of guild members as they peruse the library's extensive collection.  Each towering shelf has been equipped with its own rolling ladder for easy access to even the highest of stored tomes.  Polished granite tables have been arranged in the central area along with comfortable padded chairs for quiet reading and studying."
