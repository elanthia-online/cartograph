    "Clustered together in several small circles are high-backed leather armchairs.  Nestled in the center of each group of chairs are tables, which are constructed from black willow and trimmed in rhimar metal.  Delicate wisps of cigar smoke drift lazily in the air as its sweet, pungent scent fills the room.  Heavy brocatelle curtains completely block the bay window behind."
