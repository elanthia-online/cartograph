    "A thick stand of trees has grown up along both sides of the path, casting deep shadows upon the trail and somewhat blocking the view ahead.  Greyish moss hangs from the leaf-covered branches, gently swaying with the island breeze.  A colorful red parrot lands on the ground, then flies off squawking with triumph while carrying a fat green bug in its beak.",
    "A thick stand of trees has grown up along both sides of the path, blocking the light of the moon and stars from reaching the trail and making it quite difficult to see.  Moss illuminated by numerous glow worms in the tree's branches hang from the leaf-covered boughs and gently sway with the island breeze."
