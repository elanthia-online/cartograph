    "Brilliantly aglow with a dazzling array of lanterns, this area is extremely cluttered.  The walls of this space are nearly completely filled with bins of all shapes and sizes.  Various doll parts, from eyes to arms to legs and torsos, fill every bin.  An unfinished doll, missing her head, sits atop a large table that nearly fills the center of the room."
