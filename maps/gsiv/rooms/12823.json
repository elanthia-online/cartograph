    "The bustle of the milling crowds below hardly troubles the quiet of the upper hall.  Sunlight streams in from a large window by the wide staircase leading downward, illuminating motes of dust.  Thick carpets of rich aquamarine and cerulean tones line the hallway, muffling the tread of the occasional prosperous merchant or adventurer who has business with the town officials.",
    "The bustle of the milling crowds below hardly troubles the quiet of the upper hall.  Pewter sconces line the hall and a wide staircase, their highly polished surfaces reflecting and amplifying the flickering light of tall beeswax candles.  Thick carpets of rich aquamarine and cerulean tones line the hallway, muffling the tread of the occasional prosperous merchant or adventurer who has business with the town officials."
