    "Bursts of swearing and intermittent laughter fill the area, the sound broken only by intermittent knocks from an adjacent room.  Completely covered with ale-filled mugs and decks of cards, a group of halflings sits around a grog-stained table, while another pirate stands guard at a paneled door, opening it occasionally to let a customer inside.  Tucked into one corner, a wooden crate partially obscures a wide hole that has been gouged into the wall."
