    "Sounds of laughter and conversation echo from the residential cottages along this pleasant, cobbled street, where clumps of decorative bushes by the roadside add splashes of green to the lamplit townscape.  A small boy smiles and waves from the front steps of his home, then goes back to counting stars.",
    "The laughter of children at play echoes along this pleasant, cobbled street, where clumps of decorative bushes by the roadside add splashes of green to the mostly brown and grey townscape.  A small boy, obviously the quarry in a game of tag, darts by in an attempt to escape from his pursuers."
