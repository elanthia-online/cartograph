    "The rooftop terrace looks out over the luxurious gardens behind the manor and provides an expansive view of the town and the bay.  Large grey paving stones tile the terrace, which is dotted by beautifully groomed shrubs.  Carved stone benches are placed throughout the garden and around a large iron firepit.  A large arched trellis covered in green foliage and tiny purple flowers offers an inviting place to dance or relax under the stars.  In the far corner of the terrace sits a large brass-fitted telescope."
