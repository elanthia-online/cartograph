    "A naturally steep embankment connecting the island slope with the shoreline has been made safe for visitors with the addition of a sturdily constructed egress of pine planking and some carved stone steps leading down towards the sea.  Bright lanterns swaying in the sea breezes provide the only respite from the encompassing darkness.  Steep cliffs rise to the inland areas, though the blackness of night obscures what lies above.  Narrow, broken stone pathways to the east and west lead off toward the rest of the island.",

Steep cliffs rise to the inland areas, though a heavy, silvery grey fog obscures what lies above.  Narrow pathways of broken stones to the east and west lead off toward the rest of the island."
