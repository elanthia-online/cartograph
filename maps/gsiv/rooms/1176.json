    "Several tall maples have tumbled down into the river, perhaps victims of a combination of the river's erosion and high winds.  The trunks are strewn helter-skelter down the bluff's side with some of them coming to rest in the river below.  From all appearances they have been down quite awhile, for most of the branches are shorn off leaving jagged protrusions from the trunks.  The exposed roots on the higher ones block the trail a bit, but not enough to cause a bothersome detour."
