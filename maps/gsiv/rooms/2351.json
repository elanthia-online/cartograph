    "The chamber is huge with dense, carved stone vines curling across its walls and ceiling as if they have grown there.  On the west wall, the vines retreat, faced with the imposing portrait of a man.  Rendered in vivid colors, the man's posture is quietly intimidating.  Overhead, the bas-relief fauna almost conceals a mural that spreads across the ceiling.  From its shadows, golden eyes stare vehemently down.  A grey altar sits before the west wall, and a red altar rests in the center of the room."
