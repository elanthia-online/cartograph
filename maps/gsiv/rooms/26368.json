    "The four walls are each comprised of floor-to-ceiling mirrors, casting reflections back upon each other and leaving no angle out of view.  A throw rug in the middle of the floor, a pair of flanking leather armchairs and a small table laden with shop samples all appear duplicated over and over.  Even the arched doorway leading in and out of the shop appears copied."
