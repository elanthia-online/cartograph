    "The workshop is meticulously maintained, clearly run by somebody with a great deal of pride in what they do.  An assortment of leatherworking tools are carefully hung on the walls, outlines just visible around them for ease in replacing them once done.  There is a faint odor in the air, a bit acrid, but not unpleasant."
