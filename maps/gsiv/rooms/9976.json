    "The ground is boggy at the foot of the grassy mound that rises from the moor just to the north, and patches of delicate wildflowers thrive near the collected moisture.  Several roughly rectangular stones lie scattered around the windblown field, obviously shaped by some sentient hand but whatever purpose they once held now concealed by their scattered arrangement."
