    "Long tendrils of cobweb trail down from the shadowy ceiling, creating a haphazard garland that attaches to the burial slabs.  The biers are spaced closely together and each one carries its silent passenger covered with a shroud of netting.  Light from the crypt's door barely trespasses, as if in deference to the chamber's inhabitants."
