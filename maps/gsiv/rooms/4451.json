    "This section of the shop is slightly secluded, situated around the corner of a roughly hewn half-wall of stone.  Numerous display cases line the perimeter of the area, each filled with an array of vials that glimmer in the soft, flickering torchlight.  Set on the rear wall, just above the cases, a long oak shelf bearing flasks of various shape and size stretches across the width of the nook.  A slightly sweet scent hangs in the air."
