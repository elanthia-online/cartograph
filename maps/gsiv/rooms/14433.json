  "description": [
    "Set off from the main nave by a mistwood banister, the haon benches here have been cushioned with seats of plush blue-green velvet, indicating a more elite seating during services.  On the far wall, a wave has been skillfully painted in the changing colors of the sea complete with a white foamy crest.  Above the roiling water, an indigo starry sky adds a bit of surreal depth to this end of the temple.  A white alabaster altar stands at the center, raised up slightly on a round white marble dais."
