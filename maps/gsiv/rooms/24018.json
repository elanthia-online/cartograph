    "Rows of cots flank the path between the open tent flaps and a partitioned area in the rear.  A small staff of elven medical personnel, clearly exhausted, move smartly between the cots, doing whatever they can to ease pains and heal wounds.  Muffled grunts can be heard coming from behind the partition, and from time to time a chirurgeon wearing Ta'Vaalorian livery enters from the back room to speak with one of the medical staff before returning to her patient."
