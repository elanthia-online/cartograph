    "The southern entrance to Silver Park is guarded by a massive wrought iron gate encrusted in clear crystal.  Moonlight reflects off the prisms, illuminating the area in a soft glow.  Marking the southern side of the road, undulating earthen mounds act as fences to for small houses with a spectacular view of the beautiful grounds of the park.",
