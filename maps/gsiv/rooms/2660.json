    "The ice coating the platform flows unbroken into the nave's huge iceberg, a seamless sweep of graceful spirals that eventually merge with a monumental figure towering above.  There, a dragon plummets from the sky, its wings trailing behind it like tattered streamers.  Icy shafts protrude from the drake's neck and body and rivulets of ice seep from the wounds.  The form hovers moments before impact, its features a study of agony and at the same time, resignation to the finality of its endless fall."
