    "Nature scenes, in the form of murals, cover the walls in this cozy little room.  In the center of the room stands a large glass-covered counter, while a large mahogany armoire, painted to look like a tree stump, sits in a corner.  A lavender cedar shoe rack is nestled next to a sun-painted white oak door on the southern side of the room."
