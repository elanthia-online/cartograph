    "The glazed sandstone walls and floor of Melisii's cozy shop are lined with a large selection of fireplaces and heaters, and soft candlelight glints warmly on the various metals and trims.  The merchant smiles brightly as she demonstrates her wares to potential customers, commenting favorably on the fine workmanship of her expensive models and emphasizing the excellent value offered by her braziers and firepits."
