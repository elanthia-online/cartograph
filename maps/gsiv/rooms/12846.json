    "Lingering odors of sweet herbs and acrid resins hang in the air, commingled with thick smoke rising from misshapen candles spaced around the room.  Many of them are clustered around a skeletal spiral of black wood at one corner of the room, the tiered shelves attached to it etched with disfigured faces and twisted forms.  They lend a wavering, moody light to the area, their faint glow illuminating several displays covered in stacks of old, mildew-ridden books."
