    "The large, barn-like structure that dominates the north side of the block is the city stable.  Through a ground-floor window can be seen the rows of now-empty stalls in the dark interior.  The pavement just outside is strewn with straw and debris that merits a careful step along this part of the road.  To the west is the main square and its cobblestoned bazaar, where furious trading takes place on a daily basis."
