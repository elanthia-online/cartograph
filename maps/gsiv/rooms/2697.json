    "The great chasm turns into the mountainside, wedging itself in between two tall bluffs, creating a small ledge along the southern wall.  A small footpath follows the overhang created by the massive cliffside, edging right up against the deep canyon.  Icy spots glisten brightly as light bounces off the far side of the wide crevasse, the only cheery sight in this otherwise bleak wasteland.",
