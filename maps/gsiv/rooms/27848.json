    "Luxurious panels of black and grey flyrsilk completely line the walls of this small sanctuary.  A massive crystal sphere-shaped chandelier hangs directly over a statue of Jastev that is positioned in the center of the room.  Multiple small black candles inside the chandelier cast dancing patterns of light throughout the room.  A small grey altar painted with a black artist's brush is carefully placed just in front of the statue.  A padded black flyrsilk prayer rug sits at the altar."
