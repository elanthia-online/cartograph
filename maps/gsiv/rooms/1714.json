    "The snow blankets everything around...the tree branches, the holly bushes, the ground...to reflect the moon in a ghostly display of whiteness.  Although the wind is clearly heard in the treetops, closer to the ground the air is still, and nothing disturbs the tranquil forest except the soft crunching of feet upon the snowy trail and the occasional 'plop' of some snow escaping an overloaded tree branch.",
