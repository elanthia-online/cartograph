  "description": [
    "One of the paths traversing this section of the cavern dips sharply to the south, disappearing into the darkened depths.  Little can be seen or heard from the sections further down, discouraging the timid from further exploring the lower environs.  A slick coating of algae from the seepage across the floor only increases the danger of venturing further."
