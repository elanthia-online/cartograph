  "description": [
    "Bone-handled spades hang precariously from the roof of this shop, the faintest of breeze stirring them to clang about like an eerie metallic cacophony, reminiscent of windchimes.  Each wall is grotesquely ornamented by bloodied hooves, horns, or even lambskin tapestries splattered with dried blood and bone fragments.  An entire swathe of animal fur is draped over a bent wooden counter, which stretches out in front of some high maoral shelves."
