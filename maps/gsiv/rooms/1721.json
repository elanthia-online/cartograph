    "A thick cloudbank, trapped by the wind against the mountain, envelops the area at this altitude.  The dense clouds limit vision to only a few feet, and their moisture coats the rocks with damp, slippery ice.  More time is spent moving laterally to find just the right hold than progressing either up or down.  The wind howls and gusts all around, seemingly intent on dislodging anything foolish enough to traverse this mountainside."
