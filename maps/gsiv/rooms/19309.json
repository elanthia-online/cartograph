    "Willow Hall's library is a cheerful room despite the dark chestnut paneling and like-toned floor to ceiling bookshelves, largely due to the soft moonlight pouring in through windows across the west wall.  Leather-bound books ranging from light brown to deep burgundy are arranged along the shelves, the pattern of their colors taking on a jewel-like appearance.  Sitting on a cherry wood stand is a large open journal.",
