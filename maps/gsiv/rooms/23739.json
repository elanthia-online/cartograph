    "Dark planks of scuffed wood run the length of the hallway traversing the banks' interior.  Several broken spots along the floor's edged molding show evidence of nocturnal visitors in the form of scattered rat droppings beside each crack and hole.  Dust motes swirl with the occasional flutter of air through the hall, but the greater accumulations of debris in the corners lie largely undisturbed."
