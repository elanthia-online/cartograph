    "The roof of the tower has collapsed, and the remains litter the floor of this upper room.  Among the rubble grow a scattering of flowers, grasses, and a small sapling.  The northern wall of the room has caved in as well, giving a magnificent view of the surrounding forest and decaying cathedral."
