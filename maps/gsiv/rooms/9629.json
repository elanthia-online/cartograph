    "A log cabin resides silently in the clearing.  Moss has begun to take root on the exposed logs, and the thatch roof has collapsed, exposing the supporting rafters.  Logging instruments, rusted from lack of proper maintenance, are propped neatly against the side of the cabin.  The front door stands partially ajar."
