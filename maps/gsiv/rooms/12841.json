  "description": [
    "The feldspar flagstones of the strand here are red in tone.  Immediately catching the eye, a circle of heavy iron chains encloses a black fel weapon tree fitted with various types of whips, flails and daggers in purposefully designed slots.  Flanking opposite sides of the weapon tree, twin circles of thinner steel chain bound cultivations of startlingly contrasting white and red bleeding heart blossoms.  Providing howled warnings of intruders is a trollish lookout, manacled securely to a stout iron post."
