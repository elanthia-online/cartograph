  "description": [
    "You find the water of this quiet pool suprisingly warm, and at its deepest point no more than about six feet.  The water is just clear enough for you to see the sandy bottom, and a number of small but colorful fish in the pool with you.  At the far end is a small shallow area covered with lily pads, many in full bloom, their white and pink blossoms imparting a refreshing fragrance to the air around you."
