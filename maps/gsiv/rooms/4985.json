    "The pear-shaped objects that occupied other parts of the cavern line the floor.  These stand empty now.  Cracked and jagged pieces from their tops are scattered across the ground as if something fought its way out of their interiors.  Beside the eggs are heaps of gnawed bones.  On the very top of the bone-pile lies the skull of a human child."
