  "description": [
    "A path of red and grey stones leads away from the gate and runs along the spiked iron fence that encircles the round courtyard.  Sprouting from the center of the circular path, lush flowerbeds filled with rare exotic foliage lend their heady perfume to the air.  A colonnade of black-veined grey marble columns supports an elaborate curved entablature and creates an imposing facade for this rounded marble edifice."
