    "Silvery hoarbeam panels cover the walls of this large central room.  A few tables sit across from the bar, lit with small chandeliers suspended from the ceiling.  Above the bar, a large painting hangs directly opposite an archway.  The clanking of tankards and the sometimes loud conversation of patrons make this tavern a lively place."
