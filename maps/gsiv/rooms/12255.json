  "description": [
    "Spears of white grass cover the ground, frosted and frozen in place.  The sky is a panorama violets and blues, silvered with gusts of wind full of glistening snowflakes.  Orbs of liquid hover in the air, both near and far, and tiny sprites are suspended within, trapped in the viscous fluid.  As the blobs bob through the air, the sprites' malformed limbs struggle to move, their ragged wings are frozen, and their tiny mouths work slowly, as if chewing with their vicious teeth.",
    "Every hint of green is gone from the landscape and brown blades of grass are all that can be seen stretching to the horizon.  From the darkness of that line, the sky opens up in shades of crimson and orange, streaked with clouds of saffron.  Against the sky, small figures flit to and fro, back and forth, some huddling in groups so large they blot out the sunset hues.  Closer to the ground, sprites flitter by, their wings ragged, their bodies deformed, and their tiny mouths full of needle-like teeth."
