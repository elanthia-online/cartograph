    "The tiled walkway is cool in the shade of the portico.  A few bamboo mats and rugs are scattered around a wooden trash barrel.  An exquisite brass lantern hangs from the portico rafters.  A small, hand-lettered sign hangs on the wall.  The portico extends south.  To the southeast is a salmon-colored awning."
