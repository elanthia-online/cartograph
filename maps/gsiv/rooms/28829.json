  "description": [
    "Stalactites hang low over the rough terrain of the subterranean plateau, their sharp, curved tips almost close enough to touch.  They are clad in eerie green and blue patches of fungus that wobble in the air like fleshy protuberances.  To the east, slick steps have been carved into the rising surface of the plateau, leading upward toward a towering, shadowed figure that is vague and featureless in the darkness."
