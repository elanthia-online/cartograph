The ceiling is partially missing, allowing tree branches to encroach on the man-made structure and moonlight streaked with falling dust to filter into the dimly candle-lit space.  Rusty needles and jars with labels that have been smudged to the point of being illegible are stacked in a small pile on the ground, next to a small wood-framed mirror.",
