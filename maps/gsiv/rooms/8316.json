    "From the northwest corner of the grounds of the spider shrine, you overlook the dense pine forest surrounding the entire area.  Far to the east, you see a clearing in the trees, and the cluster of thatched shacks that serve as the dwellings of the fanatic servants of Arachne, the demanding and relentless spider goddess."
