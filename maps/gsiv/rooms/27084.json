  "description": [
    "Shadowed by arboreal giants in the distance, a coppice of rowan trees grows beyond the edges of the ambling pathway that cuts through the dense forest.  The distance between the softwoods is covered by a blanket of periwinkle and ivy vines, the purple, white, and pink blossoms forming a zig-zag pattern as they grow across the darker, heart-shaped leaves of the adjacent plant.  Withered cosmos and alpine poppies darken the soil as the creepers overtake their natural habitat."
