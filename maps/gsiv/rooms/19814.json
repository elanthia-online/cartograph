  "description": [
    "Flows of water trickle down opposite of each other on the tall, gold-veined white marble walls.  Small pools located at the base of the waterfalls ripple quietly, fed by the streams.  An elaborate statue of faceless spirits ascending toward the ceiling within a shrouding veil of roiling mist dominates the center of the room, its features cast in an illuminated glow from the twin arched windows above.  Prayer mats of alternating black and white are arranged in a circle around the statue."
