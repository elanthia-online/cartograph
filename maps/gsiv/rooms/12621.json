    "Water sweats from the ceiling, disappearing between the flagstones of the floor.  No doubt any that seeps all the way into the chamber below is vaporized quickly enough and recycled.  Now and then, a mischance causes one of the columns of steam to waver and a cloud of scalding vapor billows across the room."
