    "This massive cave dwarfs the few supplies stored here.  What few items that are here, have all been placed near the exit to the northwest.  Your footsteps echo strangely in this wide cavern.  The lighting is so dim that you cannot see into the furthest recesses of the cavern.  A fine mist gently rolls out along the floor of the cave from the west."
