    "The high rolling hills clearly visible to the south and east have become a surprisingly flat and open plain.  A faint trail heads off to the west towards an area of tall grass and odd shaped trees.  In the distance, the gentle winding course of a river is visible, marked by the flickering reflections glancing off its surface."
