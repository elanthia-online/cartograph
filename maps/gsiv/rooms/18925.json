    "Dust covers everything in the chamber with a translucent dullness, the exception being a worktable set in the center of the room and a single long shelf placed on the wall behind it.  A single candle situated atop a cast iron stand offers just enough light to reveal a well-trod path through the thick dust covering the floor to the worktable."
