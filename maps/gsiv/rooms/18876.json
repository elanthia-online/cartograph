  "description": [
    "Thick heavily stitched hangings cover the windows, leaving this room bereft of natural light.  Dozens of candles in wall sconces and silver candelabra cast a soft glow across the room.  A large four-poster bed with a hanging silk canopy occupies much of the room, with an altar sitting in one corner.  A fine bow is mounted on one wall in a place of honor, above a nightstand containing several scrolls dotted with musical notes."
