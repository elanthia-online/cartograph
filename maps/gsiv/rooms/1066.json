    "A huge grey boulder juts up from the earth directly to the north, forcing those wishing to travel in that general direction to veer to the northeast.  The top of the boulder is shrouded in the mists, and one side extends at least a hundred yards to the west before disappearing in the gloom.  The boulder's sides are slick and shiny, almost gemlike, and no path of ascension presents itself.  Small rivulets of water trickle down the surface of the boulder to drip onto the grass."
