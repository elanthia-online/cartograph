    "For a moment, you feel as though you have been somehow transported into the forecastle of some sailing ship.  This room is long and narrow, with wooden shelves on both walls that may have once served as bunks.  Even the windows here appear to have been salvaged from portholes, as they are small, round, and heavy.  The only disturbing note is a human skeleton, stretched out on the floor, one hand pointed towards the doorway in mute warning."
