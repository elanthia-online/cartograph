  "description": [
    "From the high perch of the crow's nest, the entire lounge and bar below are visible, and the din of voices and glass clinking is muted.  A large, lumpy pillow covered in patched fabrics is smooshed against the curve of the railing as an impromptu seat, and atop the banister across from it sits an age-darkened spyglass on a bronze stand.  A dark bronze masthead lantern hangs from the mast at the center of the platform above a rope ladder leading down."
