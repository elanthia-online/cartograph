    "The entry to the tent is cool and dark, offering relief from the elements outside.  The far wall is blank, save for a beaded curtain serving as the only break in the opaque black silk.  Arches to the east and west lead deeper into the structure, and a soft crimson carpet dampens the sound of footfalls on the floor.  Near the tent's flap is a metal rack that dangles scarves in myriad colors."
