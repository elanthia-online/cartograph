    "Honey-colored oak floors glow with a deep, rich varnish as they stretch to the arched white walls framed in golden linden molding.  Dangling over the center of the floor, and glowing brightly with dozens of candles, is a copper chandelier fitted with mother-of-pearl and sea glass shards that create prismatic swirls upon the stucco ceiling.  A series of hammered verdigris leaves rings the pillars that frame the entries to the north and south, while carved trilliums decorate the passage to the foyer."
