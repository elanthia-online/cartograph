    "The spicy scent of tobacco permeates the cozy room tucked beneath the inn's wide staircase.  Its walls are painted a deep shade of hunter green that compliments the rich grain of polished oak shelves lining the walls.  On the back wall, the shelves are filled with wooden tobacco boxes, while books crowd the others.  A painting of a hunting scene occupies the only expanse sans shelves, keeping watch above two over-stuffed leather armchairs."
