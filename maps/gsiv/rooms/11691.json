    "The reeds bend in and over the pathway, leaving little room to navigate without stepping off into shallow pools of tepid water or brushing against the tall plant life.  Spiderwebs decorate reeds with glistening beadlets of moisture and small, silken lumps of unfortunate victims.  The faint sound of moving water comes from the north, fading in and out depending on the stillness of the wind."
