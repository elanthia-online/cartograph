    "Slender branches arch and twine to form the walls of the ballroom, shutting out the outside while allowing a cooling breeze to enter.  The springy moss that covers the ground begs to be danced upon!  A large window stands open allowing a cool breeze to enter the room and giving access to a large branch outside, and a lilac-twined arch of leafy branches leads deeper into the tree."
