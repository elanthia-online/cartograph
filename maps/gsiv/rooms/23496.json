  "description": [
    "The room is lit by several brass lanterns that sway in time to the gentle rocking of the ship.  Cloyingly sweet cigar smoke hangs in the air, drifting in from a carved maoral arch that leads into a shady-looking casino.  A brass rod suspending a heavy black curtain with muffled sounds coming from behind it -- clearly inaccessible to the public -- is positioned near a long modwir bar at the back of the room.  A heavy scarlet curtain is draped over one of the walls, providing a dark wash of sanguine color to the bar."
