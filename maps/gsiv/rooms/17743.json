    "Long shelves hold stacks of rolled parchments while studious empaths sit at small desks in between the shelves, intently concentrating on the unrolled parchments before them.  Interestingly, the majority of the shelves appear to contain information on honing one's will, meditation, and combat prowess rather than healing arts.  Thick emerald carpet effectively muffles the sound of footsteps, and the muted lighting from the small small table lamps contributes to the atmosphere of quiet contemplation."
