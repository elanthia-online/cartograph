    "[East Barbican, South Tower]"

  "description": [
    "The tower's interior is protected from both the elements and attack by a massive ironwood door further reinforced with dark steel.  A long, winding stairway spirals up the edge of the circular walls, ascending towards the very top of the barbican.  An iron-barred gate stands before the very first step, its bars glistening with a faint coat of ice.  A few simple glass vases rest at the foot of the gates, each filled to the brim with a collection of dried flower petals."
