    "This room is damp, and mold grows between the natural cracks in the rock on both the walls and the ground.  Dripping water slowly trickles down the mossy wall and disappears through a small hole in the rock floor.  There are several overturned yellow and orange crates along one wall that serve as display units for many different dyes."
