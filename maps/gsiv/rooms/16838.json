    "Promotional scrolls for many of Bluerock Brewery's signature beers and ales have been tacked carefully upon the bleached stone walls.  Neatly furnished, the tidy office features a glaes-paned curio cabinet, an immaculately clean desk, and a sturdy high-backed chair.  The faint aroma of roasted barley lingers in the air, mingling with a distinctly earthy scent originating from somewhere unseen."
