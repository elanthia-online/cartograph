  "description": [
    "Faded silken pennants trail from narrow patinated rods jutting outward over the bronze double doors of the entryway.  Walls of smooth sandstone stretch high above, stippled with reflective circles of hammered copper.  Intermittently gracing the tiled ground, diamond-shaped verdigris accents add tenuous slices of color to the neutral stonework."
