    "A dry coolness pervades the inside of the barn.  The walls keep the night's cold out, and the layer of chaff on the floor absorbs much of the moisture from the air.  High above, the upward cant of the roof reverses for a few feet, and spaces purposely left between the boards allow moonlight to enter the barn and illuminate the area.
