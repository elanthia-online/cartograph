    "A bulbous-nosed Paradis halfling greets patrons through loudly chattering teeth as they drift near his wares and explore the goods for sale.  He glances around before ducking slightly and stealing a sip from a small silver flask before returning it to his coat pocket.  He straightens again and and smiles widely, rubbing his arms in an effort to stay warm."
