    "Benches, weapon racks, and other odd pieces of wood are stacked atop each forming a makeshift barrier that blocks all but one side of the corridor, where it apparently was breached.  The area behind the barrier is littered with abandoned and broken weapons, smashed helms and shattered shields.  Three skeletons lay stacked one atop the other, their dull white bones separated only by rotting leather armor."
