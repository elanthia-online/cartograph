    "Crafted from rich oak and maple woods, this rickety dome-shaped structure seems even more enormous from the inside.  Anchored on the floor in the center of the structure is a twisted crystal spire that stretches skywards, through a large hole cut in the ceiling.  Surrounding the base of the spire is an ornate wooden bin etched with a golden anvil."
