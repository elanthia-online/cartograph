    "A woven net hangs limply between two oaks, its web-like material tattered and broken.  Resembling a hammock, the net is cluttered with dead leaves and the broken ends of branches, its frayed ends hanging low enough to touch the leaf-covered earth.  A faint overgrown trail breaks off from the crumbling cobbled path, heading off into the deeper shadows of the woods."
