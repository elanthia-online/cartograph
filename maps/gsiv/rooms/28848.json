  "description": [
    "A bend in the stone walls fosters a small cache of crates.  Straw litters the ground and pokes from between their slats in a few places, but the crates seem intact.  Similarly, a round ironwood vat pushed to the back of the stockpile is meticulously sealed with pitch, the ironwood construction reinforced with bands of heavy steel."
