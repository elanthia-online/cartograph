    "The fine, white sand and rounded pebbles on the floor of the dry creek bed make walking difficult but the dense thickets of the spinewood trees and traesharm shrubs along the banks make the former watercourse the best route.  Better to struggle through the sand than to get lost in the trackless wilds that can hide all manner of unpleasant surprises."
