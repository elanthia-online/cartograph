    "The cool interior of the shop is filled with racks of clothing, and one wall holds shelves displaying footwear and accessories.  A muted crimson carpet spreads across the stone floor, and the wood-paneled walls are painted a subdued grey.  A pair of young elven clerks work diligently, organizing the wares by type, color, and size, and politely greeting customers as they enter the shop."
