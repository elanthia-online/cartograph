  "description": [
    "Marking the northern boundary of the valley, a narrow gorge slices through the plain.  A row of trees lines its edge, visible only as vertical streaks smudged across a dull, gray canvas.  The land begins to rise and fall past the gorge, forming low hills that strain upwards as if trying to match the magnificence of the mountains they sit beneath.  The wind whistles hauntingly."
