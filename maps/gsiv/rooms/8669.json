    "Sheltered from the traffic and patrons of the dining room by stained partitions topped by colored paintings, this table for two still gives you a view of the dining hall. The candle at the edge of the table creates flickering shadows which dance hypnotically alongside the walls. Linen napkins have been folded on the tablecloth, and a single wild rose sits freshly picked in a tiny vase."
