  "description": [
    "A long terrace snakes around the side of the cliff to the east.  Light grey ice plant cascades down the northern wall from above, clinging to the white limestone outcroppings.  To the south the ground drops steeply away, tumbling over the wall to the canal below.  Various stations have been set up to allow training in weaponry, martial arts, and bodybuilding, and several sets of sandbags rest under a tall gingko tree.  Far to the east, two figures stand as if awaiting someone."
