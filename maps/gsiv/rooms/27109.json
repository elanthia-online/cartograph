    "Narrowing abruptly, the ledge becomes precarious as loose bits of earth tumble and roll down towards the tidal pools.  Evidence of an earlier landslide litters the beach where the debris is relentlessly pounded by the surf.  Rising like a brilliant sun from the gap, a matted tangle of fiery orange blossoms adds a splash of color to the neutral tones of the sun-bleached grass and rocky soil.  Taking advantage of the abundance of small outcroppings, a purple-footed lizard suns itself on a rock."
