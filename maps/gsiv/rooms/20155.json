  "description": [
    "Cedar trees spread all around, their ancient, cracked limbs sticking out at every angle imaginable.  Thin rivulets of a black, sticky substance wind through the grove in a snake-like path, slithering out from somewhere below a small wooden shack.  The thin stream moves toward the clearing to the south, but at its edge, it veers off into a more dense area of cedar before disappearing from sight."
