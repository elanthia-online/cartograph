    "Herbs and flowers of all kinds are planted in an orderly fashion in beds surrounding a small stone cottage, the plants clearly benefiting from a large patch of sunshine streaming through a break in the surrounding forest.  Bees whir happily betwixt the various blooms as the heady fragrance of the flora drifts on the air.",
    "Herbs and flowers of all kinds are planted in an orderly fashion in beds surrounding a small stone cottage, the cool night air stirring the plants just enough to waft their heady fragrances upon the breeze.  Golden yellow light shines from the cottage's glaesine windows, a welcoming beacon in the darkness."
