    "Through an opening in the city's fortifying walls, a large dock extends out over the Mistydeep.  Although the boats anchored at the docks appear to be primarily pleasure crafts, there are a few cargo barges floating further out in the river.  A few elven sailors wander the docks seeing to various maintenance tasks.",
