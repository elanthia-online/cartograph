    "The thick mists drape heavily.  Long blades of wet grass overhang over the trail, soaking anything that has to move between them.  The soggy ground squishes underfoot, and the mashed grasses on the trail combine with mud from underneath to form a slick, treacherous surface.  One misstep could result in a soaked, dirty backside or, perhaps worse, a face full of muddy grass.  Keeping one's eye on the trail and trudging diligently forward might be the best plan."
