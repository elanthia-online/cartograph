    "An ornamental pond occupies the northeast edge of the sculptured gardens, its surface almost covered with water lilies.  From its center, a statue of a fish spouts a fountain of water, throwing off rainbows in the light.  A row of statues opposite it carry on the aquatic theme, displaying forms of leaping dolphins and curled seahorses.",
