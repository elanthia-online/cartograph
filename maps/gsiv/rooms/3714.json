    "The dim flicker of torchlight casts shadows that flit across the uneven stone walls in a macabre dance that evokes images of death and demons.  A heavy, iron door hangs from rusted hinges.  A crude, iron ladder leads up to a sturdy-looking trapdoor.  The trapdoor has a strong-looking spring mechanism across its underside."
