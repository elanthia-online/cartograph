    "Murals of beautiful white horses fill the walls between the entrances to other rooms.  Above, a stained glass scene depicts an old shaggy-haired man with wings on his back, his feet surrounded by the dark, purplish-grey and green-tinged hues of a storming sea.  Plain white tiles underfoot have been painted with fanciful conch shells of various sizes."
