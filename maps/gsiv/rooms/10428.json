    "A large glaes bay window hides behind sheer gold-threaded ivory voile curtains, giving discriminating shoppers a modicum of privacy as they look over the displayed wares.  Suspended by thin gold chains in the center of the window, an ebonwood sign has been painted with the name of the shop on both sides."
