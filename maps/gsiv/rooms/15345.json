    "A midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A potted palm tree sits in one corner of a mistwood plank floor.  There is a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on one side of the shop and a glass-topped mistwood counter on the other."
