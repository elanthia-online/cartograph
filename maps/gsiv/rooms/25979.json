    "Resting in the center of the thick ivory carpet is a tall linden-framed mirror.  Several benches cushioned in deep green Vornavian silk are placed about the dressing chamber. The far wall boasts a large sea glass mosaic of a grand swan that glistens as warm tendrils of sunlight from the skylight above illuminate the beautiful creature."
