    "The tile on the floor gradually changes over from an off-white sandstone to a floral-patterned white sandstone.  Several benches and comfy-looking chairs are positioned throughout the room to provide patrons of the cafe a relaxing place to rest and have a drink.  A domed stained glass skylight and several windows allow the soft glow of the moons to enter the cafe.",
