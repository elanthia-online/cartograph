  "description": [
    "Barely as wide as a human's arm span, the mist-slicked ledge mocks any who try to move swiftly.  Loose pebbles of chert and quartz underfoot prevent a firm footing near the foreboding drop.  The pervasive scent of the sea lends a sharp tang to the winds whipping up from below."
