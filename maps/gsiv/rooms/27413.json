    "The walls of this canvas tent move with the breeze from outside.  Bare earth serves as the floor, and the ground underfoot is littered with peanut shells.  At one end of the room is a stage of sorts, built out of heavy stone sturdy enough to hold heavy props.  No seating has been made available, leaving only the meager space between the front of the stage and the tent walls for spectators to gather."
