    "Shelves full of books line two sides of the compact booth, which is fashioned from unfinished cypress wood, and a pocketed wall-hanging holds various painted cards.  Plastered around the sale items are colorful posters depicting both exotic and mundane locations, each marked with a different signature.  A small counter situated in the center of the stall holds a large basket of quills."
