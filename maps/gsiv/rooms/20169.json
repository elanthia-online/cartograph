    "Resembling a repurposed and aging granary, the small structure has rounded walls of rough oak that display signs of past water damage.  Swollen boards mingle with newer ones where the more rotted pieces have been replaced, while a roof of fresh thatching sits above.  In the center of the small space, an enormous crate is filled with blown glass bottles and has a small steel pail resting beside it.  A dirty-faced human child hangs out near a high wooden stool and watches over everyone that enters and leaves the granary."
