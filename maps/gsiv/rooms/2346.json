    "Deep shafts cut into the glacial walls bring sunlight streaming into this open gallery.  Bright and colorful banners hang from the ceiling, dancing in the gentle swirls of wind that carry down the center of the hall.  A harp and voice, unseen, blend melody and harmony in a gentle, joyful song.  In the middle of the hall, at the intersection of color, form, and sound, stand three wooden altars in hues of blue, gold, and grey."
