  "description": [
    "The bustle of the crowds gathered along the market path is interrupted by the occasional whinny of an armor-clad horse making its way from the stables located in the southern area of the woods.  Brightly colored vermilion pennants wave to and fro from slender wooden poles, creating temporary shade from the elements above.  The sounds of the cheering crowd burst through the chatter, coming from the jousting arena to the northeast."
