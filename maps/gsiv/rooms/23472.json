    "Makeshift walls formed by canvas-draped stacks of crates reflect the lantern light, creating an oasis within the otherwise dark cargo hold.  Near a gap in the canvas stands a small wooden bin that contains an assortment of wands.  Further back in this cargo hold-niche, a low canvas-covered box bears a few odds and ends, and against the back wall a tall modwir rack supports several wand harnesses."
