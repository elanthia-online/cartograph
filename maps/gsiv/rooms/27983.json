    "A large oaken table sits at the center of this small room, its surface carefully carved and painted to recreate the streets and structures of Ta'Illistim.  Colorful glass flacons sit atop the table on display, almost serving as monument markers.  A many-pronged chandelier casts the graven landscape in bright candlelight."
