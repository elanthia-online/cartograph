    "Four massive white columns stand at the corners of this raised pavilion.  Draped around and between them are large swathes of white silk.  Bright lights are carefully placed so as to be diffused by the silk, blunting their effect while still providing plenty of light.  A free-standing armor rack stretches across one wall of the pavilion, and a low marble table dominates the center of the space.  A scrollworked plaque is prominently mounted on one of the colums.",
