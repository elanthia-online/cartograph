    "This cabin was likely an officer's quarters.  A complex lock, rusted and inoperable, hangs amongst the remains of the door.  A broken and rotting desk sits tipped on one side in the northeast corner of the room.  A looted footlocker, broken and empty, sits in the middle of the room.  The door leads north into the hold.",
    "This cabin was likely an officer's quarters.  The remains of a lock, molten as if by great heat, glistens from the ashy remains of the door.  A pile of burnt wood that might have once been a desk sits tipped on one side in the northeast corner of the room.  A looted footlocker, shattered and empty and coated with soot, sits in the middle of the room.  The hole where the door once hung leads north into the hold."
