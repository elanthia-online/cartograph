    "The forest ends at the edge of a tranquil meadow.  Against the dark shadow of the trees, the meadow grass is a silvery sea in the moonlight.  A stream cuts across the sward, its edges bordered by the black silhouettes of boulders and tall cattails where bends in its course create a marshy terrain."
