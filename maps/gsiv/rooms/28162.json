    "Strong maple poles support the ceiling and walls of this spacious tent.  Shimmering crimson silk hangs from the frame and falls to the ground in a puddle of soft fabric.  Several lanterns hang from the supports shedding a warm light over the room.  A large ebonwood sign sits on the corner of a thick gold rug covering the ground."
