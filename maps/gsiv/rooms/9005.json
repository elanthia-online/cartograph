  "description": [
    "Dark velvet curtains cover every inch of wall space, seemingly in order to keep out both sound and the bitter cold.  Seated upon a richly cushioned chair of highly polished modwir is a rather youngish, but richly dressed, halfling.  You recognize a resemblance to the statue of the warrior in Porter Street and realize that this must be his infamous descendant, Trevor Dabbings, who first showed the residents of Wehnimer's the way to Icemule Trace."
