    "Meandering through the lawn and a meticulously manicured flower bed, the flagstone path moves about a grey marble reflecting pool filled with large goldfish.  Flowering bushes and bright blossoms grow about, their color reflecting off the stone.  Nestled in a secluded verdant nook, a colorful woven hammock hangs between two giant twin oak trees.  The lawn drops away at the western edge, where a set of stone steps lead down toward the beach."
