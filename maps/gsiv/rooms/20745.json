  "description": [
    "Providing both a rustic and elegant backdrop to a stately lodge, tall birches grow along a large expanse of finely-trimmed, emerald green lawn bordered by a thick pine forest.  To the east, the trees are more sparse, the ocean just barely visible through them.  A long, rectangular reflecting pool stands in the center of the lawn, bordered by two thin strips of brightly hued flower beds.  Resting on the lip of the pool is a small earthenware bowl that holds a handful of birdseed."
