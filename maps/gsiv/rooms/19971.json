  "description": [
    "The whole room is set up to resemble a street at the brink of a town's protective barricade, which is built into the museum wall and depicted standing wide open, giving a glimpse of the surrounding countryside in a detailed landscape painting.  Amidst the replicated buildings are specimens of Wehnimer's Landing's most interesting fauna.  A replica shaggy mutt sits on the street, head cocked to one side.  Near the Furrier's facade, a stuffed tiny kitten crouches, frozen in the act of pouncing on a perfectly preserved giant rat."
