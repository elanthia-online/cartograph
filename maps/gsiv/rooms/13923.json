  "description": [
    "Below the dock, a smaller raft-like platform floats on the river, while many large barrels keep the mooring afloat with several thick hemp ropes tying it firmly in place.  White froth churned up by the moving river dances about the edge, occasionally disturbed by small fish swimming underneath.  A few crates and barrels are stacked ready to be loaded on to one of the small fishing dories secured to the landing."
