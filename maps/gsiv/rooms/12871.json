    "Deep marks in the mud lead from the road to a collapsed wagon pushed near a rotting shed and marred with deep grooves, ash, and water stains.  Opposite the wagon sits a pair of well-kept houses, freshly painted and trimmed with polished wood.  Innumerable footprints line the street to and from both the north and south."
