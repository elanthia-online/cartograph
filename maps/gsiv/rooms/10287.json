    "Thick wooden planks support the walls of this tiny underground room, trying none too successfully to keep mud and dirt from entering.  The tiny room is cluttered with boxes and barrels, as well as some raggedy patchwork blankets.  Low on the southern wall is a gap in the boards that opens onto a tunnel leading down."
