    "The landscape is wild and challenging here, remote and forbidding.  The ground dips and rises between thick, close undergrowth and rocky outcroppings.  The level of the land rises to the south gradually at first, and then more sharply, disappearing up into the distance.  To the north, the slope is gentler and less hazardous."
