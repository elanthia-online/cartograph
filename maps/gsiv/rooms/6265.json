  "description": [
    "The ground slopes downward and the thin yellow mist that clings about the vale hangs heaviest to the west.  Northward a wooded promontory overlooks the vale.  The great splendid oaks of the Dragonsclaw lean out over the precipice as though peering in disapproval at the shabby squatters below.  Some of the huts here have been built against the face of the promontory: an architectural style favored by lazy builders and maggot-hunters."
