    "Interestingly, the walls have been crafted with stacked bones and skulls in artsy, symmetric patterns.  Even more unusual than the walls is a massive statue, meticulously crafted into a detailed image of a rat.  The statue stands at least ten feet high and looms in the center of this chamber.  The raised platform that the statue resides on is a pile of skulls and bones.  Located on the base of the platform is a plaque."
