    "The ceiling slants downward from a peak overhead, mimicking the shape of the roof above.  Hooks have been placed on the lower part of the ceiling towards one side of the room, various tools used in the art of locksmithing and repairing lockpicks hanging from them.  Beneath them is a worn oak table that looks as though it might once have been a fine piece.  Windows up near the peak of the ceiling on either side of the room provide the only light, the lamps overhead unlit.",
