    "You notice a small firepit in this room with many furs laid out across the floor as beds.  Several crates are stacked along the south side of the room containing more furs and chunks of rusted iron.  Along the north side of the room, several timbers have been set in place to support the ceiling and wall from a possible cave-in."
