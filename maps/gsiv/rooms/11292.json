    "Only small areas of the stone walls making up this building are free of scorch marks and cracks.  It's obvious that this was the scene of intense fighting, as the defenders made a desperate last stand.  To the east the walkway leads past a fractured stone entryway.  To the northwest it heads towards a small green mound."
