    "A multihued Vornavian silk tapestry hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls, and an exposed pine rafter ceiling rises overhead.  A slender umbrella tree statue sits in one corner of a water-stained light pine floor.  There is a Vornavian silk-covered table on one side of the shop and a set of carved felwood shelves on the other."
