  "description": [
    "A thick wool rug covers the wooden floor, a carved table resting in the center.  Several cushioned chairs are set about the intimate gathering space with a large sofa taking up much of the room.  A small wicker basket is tucked to one side of a cast iron stove that occupies a shadowed corner of the room.  Curtained with blue silk, a picture window looks out over the var below."
