    "Sconces line the walls in neatly ordered rows, their bright orange flames casting flickering shadows across the smooth earthen floor.  The dank air holds a faint scent of decay, the smell hardly noticeable through the moist air.  A deep pit has been dug into the middle of the floor, the iron bars of an oubliette barely discernable in the murky shadows."
