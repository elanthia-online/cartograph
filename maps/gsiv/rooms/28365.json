  "description": [
    "A crescent-shaped stained glass window high on the wall allows a few stray moonbeams to filter in, but the soft glow that pervades the room comes from the red, white and black candles lining the top of an intricately-carved ebonwood table.  In the center of the marble floor is a summoning circle with points facing north, east, south and west, each clearly marked with a silvery imflass star.  Evenly placed around the edge of the circle are nine more stars."
