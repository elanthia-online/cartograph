    "A braided bronze railing guards the edges of the wooden balcony, which is separated from the rest of the sanctum by a painted paper screen and a series of short steps that provide the balcony proper with sufficient elevation to see over Vornavis's western wall.  Resplendent in the sunlight, the graceful city spreads beyond the dark stone barrier.",

Slumbering in the pale moonlight, the graceful city spreads beyond the dark stone barrier."
