    "Almost as tall as an average human, the stalks of artichoke grow upright in the field, which is better accessed via a narrow path that leads toward the center.  Small buds dot the artichoke stalks, and although their petals are tightly wrapped around the hearts, they do not seem quite ready to harvest.  Off to the side of the field, several thin tree stumps are ringed with tiny mushrooms."
