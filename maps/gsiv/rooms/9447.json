    "Brightly lit by several torches set in iron sconces on the walls, the smoothly tunneled corridor allows no room for shadows to dwell.  Colorful iron doors mark the entry to each cell, each with a different native gem set into the doorway to make differentiation simple.  A set of low steps leads north and down to a lower level of the prison, while to the south, the entry can be glimpsed beyond the burly dwarven guard who stands watch."
