    "A round invar-framed window hangs on one of the smooth sandstone walls, and a sturdy white cedar ceiling rises overhead.  A glazed ceramic snail planter sits in one corner of a weathered cobblestone floor.  There is a painted red cedar rack on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
