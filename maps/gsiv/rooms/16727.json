    "A river of fire extends around the walls to converge in a sea of flame underneath the gigantic altar.  The blaze's red cast reflects off the russet mithril curtains and the crystal-encrusted ceiling, bathing the room in a warm, flickering glow.  Long benches provide places to sit and quietly contemplate if one does not feel distracted by the crackling fire all around.  The room has been arranged so that all attention is directed toward the gigantic altar and the rising wall just behind it."
