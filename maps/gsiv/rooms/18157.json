    "The chambers open up into a vast, yawning expanse, and the dark waters of an underground lake spread onward into the darkness.  A constant rhythm of drip-drops continually echoes through the massive chambers, the unseen stalactites above dutifully carrying on their eternal cycle of growth.  A small upraised path winds its way through the lake, the faint torchlight that flanks it appearing as fireflies in the deep blackness."
