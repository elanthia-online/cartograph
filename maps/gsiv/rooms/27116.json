  "description": [
    "The abundance of vegetation characteristic of the untamed jungle suddenly gives way to a towering kapok tree, the giant of the forest dominating the scenery in its majestic presence.  Giving the massive being a wide berth, the thick carpeting of grass and fallen leaves provides a moisture-soaked home for the flourishing mushrooms and fungi occupying the rarity of space in the clearing.  Mist infiltrates the area, lending further dampness to the muddy soil as the smell of decay permeates the senses."
