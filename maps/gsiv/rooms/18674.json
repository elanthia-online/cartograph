    "A room of modest proportions, its design is clearly more functional and less decorative than the rest of the guild.  Boasting little in the way of ornament, the only point of interest is a glass hurricane lamp mounted high on the wall.  Within the bulb of the lamp, a pool of silvery-blue liquid resides, giving rise to a steadily burning, brilliantly white flame."
