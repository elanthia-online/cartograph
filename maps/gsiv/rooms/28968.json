    "An errant breeze ruffles the gauzy curtains that frame a picture of a frog sitting on a box.  Backlit by candles in wrought iron wall sconces, tiny motes ride the current, eddying around and over a wide assortment of baubles, curios, and statues.  A thick layer of fresh reeds supports a braided burgundy rug, and a well-used broom leans against a brass plaque affixed to the wall.  Mounted strategically above a windowed blue door is a brass bell."
