    "The wide staircase comes to an end at an enormous round room.  A flat walkway extends from the stairs to a pure white altar in the center of the room, while elsewhere the floor has been carved to resemble the surface of the planet, complete with oceans and forests and high mountain ranges.  The thin ice of the cavernous domed ceiling not only permits sunlight to bathe the room, but opens up a breathtaking view of the heavens above.",
