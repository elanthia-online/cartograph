    "Hanging from the northern wall is a tapestry dedicated to Sheru.  The remainder of the wall is devoid of any adornment, leaving Sheru to appear as if set off from the rest of the dark gods.  Large slabs of granite make up the floor and walls of this hallway, cut to perfection to form a seamless surface."
