    "Belonging to a child or perhaps to a halfling member of the manor's staff, a small bed lies collapsed in the room's northeast corner.  The room's floorboards appear intact, but sag in several places, and cobwebs fill the corners.  Soot from the room's small fireplace has been blown out across the hearth and covers almost half of the floor."
