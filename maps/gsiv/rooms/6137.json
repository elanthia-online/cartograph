  "description": [
    "A cold, wet mist rises from the hard-packed ground that is strewn with crushed pieces of stone.  Huge boulders and slabs of rock are separated here and there by trails which lead off in many directions, like the spokes in a wheel.  Tufts of fur cling to the wet surface of the nearest rock, which has a footprint of enormous proportions visible at its base."
