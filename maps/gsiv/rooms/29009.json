  "description": [
    "Exposed rafters hold iron-caged lanterns aloft and illuminate the small jailhouse with a bright light that is reflected in the polished oak floorboards.  Several chairs sit outside a white-edged cinquefoil archway, a board of wanted posters tacked above them, while a dented and scratched door occupies the eastern wall and has a small rainbow glaes window next to it.  Hooks and pegs flank the entry, some holding foul weather gear and others empty."
