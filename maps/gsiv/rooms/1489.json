    "Just to the north, Baron's Bridge arches over the waters of the Vornavis Canal, connecting South 'Haven with North 'Haven and Marshtown.  A constant flow of townsfolk moves in both directions over the granite span, occasionally delayed by horse drawn wains hauling loads of sun dried marsh hay from the Marshtown haycribs to the South 'Haven mews.",
    "Just to the north, the shattered ruins of the Baron's Bridge jab up through the waters of the Vornavis Canal, looking like nothing so much as accusing, fleshless fingers pointed at the heedless sky."
