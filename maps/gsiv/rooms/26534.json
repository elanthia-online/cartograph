    "Disheveled sand meets tidy rugs along the backside of the pavilion, the two proprietors' personalities clearly clashing in this small space.  The eastern edge appears to be filled with storage boxes, discarded traps, and fishing nets, while the opposite side houses an orderly workbench with clean tools spaced at even intervals.  The southern wall of the pavilion plays host to a very large painting surrounded by a frame carved with decorative oyster shells."
