  "description": [
    "Tucked away in the back of the manor is an elegant sitting room.  A sliding glass door dominates the north wall, giving a peek at the bright sky and the verdant garden beyond.  Several cushioned chairs are placed around a small mistwood table, creating an intimate setting.  A small porcelain stove sits in the corner, a basket of supplies open beside it.  A buffet table decorates the east wall, atop it sits a small ceramic pot filled with thick greenery, its long tendrils of leaves creeping down the side."
