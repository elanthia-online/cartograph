    "A long, polished mahogany desk takes up most of the northern space in the room, its front surface carved with a bas-relief of a large kraken with tentacles that reach to the outer edges of the desk.  A series of slots and pigeon holes line the wall behind the surly innkeeper, a few of the room keys visible inside their recesses.  A plush sanguine runner travels the length between the foyer and front desk, its soft material covering the rough oak floorboards."
