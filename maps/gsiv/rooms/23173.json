    "Small boulders mark the pathway that leads into the area, their grey faces lost beneath yellow-tinged moss and the dust of frequent footsteps.  Where the path's end opens into a clearing, a tall wyrmwood tree stretches upward, and within its branches are small, hollow-reed windchimes that add flat, discordent accents to the out of tune melody from the painted wooden carousel nearby.  A creeping mist silvered by ambient light haunts the ground, and its grey fingers reach into the air as it is stirred by churning breezes."
