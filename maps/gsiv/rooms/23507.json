    "Bare wooden planks serve as walls in this brightly lit, though sparsely decorated room.  Ropes of varying length and thickness hang from the ceiling, tied to the beams above with all manner of sailor's knots.  A sturdy modwir table holds a number of lengths of rope tied in various knots available for purchase.  Toward the back wall, the ceiling is clear of dangling obstacles, creating a slightly less cluttered workspace."
