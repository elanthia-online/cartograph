    "Stifling heat is nearly overwhelming in this small room, the result of hundreds of tiny votives lit and displayed in tiny glaes holders set into low ironwork frames.  Almost every square inch of wall space here has been tacked with squares of parchment curling with humidity and fading.  On a simple table is a stack of fresh parchments, an ink bottle, and a quill, for those wishing to leave a prayer of need or thanks to the Messenger."
