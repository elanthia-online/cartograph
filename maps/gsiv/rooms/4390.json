    "Smooth, grey granite makes up the surfaces of this cavern, which is carved out into a perfectly orb-shaped area.  Tied around nails that have been hammered into the ceiling are thin ropes weighted down by a long, iron candle fixture.  An unusually carved sign hangs down in the midst of the candles.  To one side of the cavern is a tall iron rack, while a short iron stand crafted with various grooves and hooks stands opposite."
