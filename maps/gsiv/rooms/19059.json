    "The galley spans the aft end of the deckhouse, with a door leading out to starboard.  A work counter fills the north wall, and cabinets are built above and beneath it.  A stove sits opposite, its smokepipe extending through the roof.  Large kettles bubble on the stove's black, iron grill, filling the galley with the aroma of a hearty stew.  Obviously, these sailors eat well, at least while they're in port.  Hanging on the wall is a cargo list."
