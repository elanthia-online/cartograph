    "The trail straightens abruptly, as though the trees are standing aside to usher the path along.  On either side, huge trunks stand side-by-side, making any deviation from the way impossible.  Sunlight is unable to penetrate the thick canopy overhead, leaving the ground a dark tunnel ringed in black foliage and bark.",
