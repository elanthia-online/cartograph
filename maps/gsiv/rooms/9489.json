  "description": [
    "A long narrow room extends northward from the faux-maple door on the south wall.  The granite floor is painted a light sienna color, and small, black oval rugs affixed to the floor lead to the bed against the north wall.  The walls and ceiling match the floor in color.  Two toadstools in large stone pots, one near the door and one near the bed, illuminate the room with a soft amber-and-white glow.  No other furniture intrudes upon the rather austere setting."
