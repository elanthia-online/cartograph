    "The amber cast of the torchlight makes the damp, grey stones glisten with a green iridescence, giving the widening chamber a sickly countenance.  To one side, shelves have been carved into the rock, and they rise into an arch that shelters a carved granite altar.  On the other lies a seeming shrine of bones, stacked high and wide and arranged in configurations both mystical and profane.",
