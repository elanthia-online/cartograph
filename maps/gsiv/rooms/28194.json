    "Strong maple poles covered with rich crimson silk form the walls of this spacious tent.  A small ebonwood sign hangs from one of the varnished supports.  A thick deep red carpet covers the ground, a golden sunburst pattern in the center.  A pair of lanterns hang from above, bathing the area in halo of bright light."
