    "Standing near the railing, the entire ground level of the showroom can be viewed from this vantage point of the gallery.  A wide curving staircase leads back down to the main floor.  Emanating from the iridescent, domed skylight above, pale moonlight creates a rainbow of cascading colors.  Streaks of colors rain down over an antique thanot wood cabinet containing a few brawling weapons set securely behind heavy, etched glass doors.",
