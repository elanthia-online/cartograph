    "The Locksmehr river sweeps lazily through the grasslands in a series of oxbows, its clear, spring-fed waters gently rolling on towards the sea.  Streamers of aquatic vegetation writhe hypnotically in the slow current, as if they were swimming against it.  A path parallels the western bank of the river, allowing travel towards a clutch of wooden buildings to the south."
