    "[Chartreuse Wing Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Yellow-green hues, the color of a ripe pear, are predominant in this section, from the tufted seat cushions to the samite runner along the floor with its gold and chartreuse tassles.  A border of dragonflies runs along the outer edge of the table, each fitted with a mosaic of peridot, malachite, and aventurine shards.  In the center, several tiles help to keep serving vessels cold or hot, as needed."
