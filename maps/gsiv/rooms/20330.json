  "description": [
    "A gnarled tangle of creepers suffocates the little dry land in the area.  Breaking through the barrier of vines that float over the top of the water, bald cypresses rise up toward the heavens, their limber branches laden with thick, draping moss, their trunks surrounded by knobby knee growths that look like stunted stalagmites rising from the depths of the swamp."
