  "description": [
    "Sunlight streams through a small dormer window, bathing the hallway in a soft, golden light.  An unlit brass lamp hangs above the winding stairs.  A small, ale-stained, sisal rug covers the floor.  The pleasant smell of ale and the sound of clinking glasses comes from the west."
