    "Brilliant yellow butterflies flitter around a patch of tall white-flowered weeds that grow at the edge of the woods along the western edge of the path.  A few head-sized stones have been moved from the open field and placed in a rough row just this side of the trees, arranged in a crude boundary line.",
