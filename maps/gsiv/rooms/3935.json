    "A warm gust of air counteracts the dank chill of the tunnel as it blows in from an opening to the north, and through a side passage to the south.  Graves are excavated at close intervals into the walls along the east-west axis of the tunnel here.  Several small streams flow into this room to connect with a larger one running down the center of the floor."
