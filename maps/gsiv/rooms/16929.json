    "The footpath continues to cut through the verdant lawn, curving gently from north to southeast.  To the northeast sits a fountain and set of stone benches at the courtyard center.  A tall, spindly poplar lends some sparse shade where you could, if you were so inclined, sit and watch most of what goes on within the Guild walls."
