  "description": [
    "The hushed closeness of thick, cut-stone walls embrace the murky darkness of this windowless anteroom.  The few rays of moonlight penetrating from outside vaguely illuminate the floor's uneven paving stones and the ladder ascending to a small platform that projects from an otherwise featureless north wall.  The sharpened ends of a massive, iron-pronged deadfall suspend perilously overhead from a heavy chain affixed to a hewn oak beam supporting the roof."
