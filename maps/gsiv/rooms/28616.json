  "description": [
    "To either side of the entry arch, the flames of twin candles flicker softly through a pair of translucent red glaes honeycombs to bathe the room in gentle carmine light.  Sounds are muted by the plush carpeting, whose sunny shade complements silk-slashed velvet drapes enshrouding a bower of monir heartwood.  Within, its snowy edges undimmed by the shadows in which it rests, resides a smooth rosewood altar that is partially draped in golden satin.  A vast and intricate tapestry spans the ceiling from wall to wall."
