    "The trees along the pathway through the slough have a diseased look about them.  A patch of color visible through the dull grey fog reveals itself to be a deep, reddish-purple patch of mold on the side of a gnarled and dying haon tree.  The boggy path disappears into the fog to the north and northeast."
