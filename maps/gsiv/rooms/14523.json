    "The rocky path continues here, leading to a ring of aloe palms.  Each of the spike-leafed plants hosts towering sets of bright red flowers, their soft scent filling the area with a sweet but musky smell.  Scarred openings on the elongated leaves ooze a viscous, green substance, globs of which lay drying in the dirt beneath."
