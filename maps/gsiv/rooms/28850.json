  "description": [
    "Flat and sleek, the barge has no room for crew quarters and a small depression in the deck that suffices as its hold.  It sits low in the water, weighed down by crates and a reinforced ironwood barrel so heavy that it sets the deck at an uncomfortable cant.  Faint, sickly green light seeps from between the slats of the barrel.  Sagging and warped, a gangplank leads down to the bordering dock."
