    "A crude path snakes down to the waterline through the boulders, no doubt the result of animals coming to drink.  The narrow width of ground is muddy and pitted with animal tracks, too many to leave any distinct.  Bits of moss and lichen on the path create tones of green and gold that glow against the drab grey of stone and white of snow patches."
