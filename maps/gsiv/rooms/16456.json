    "This luxurious office is panelled in fine cedar that fills the room with its woodsy scent.  Finely-carved tables are set here and there, bearing models of a variety of elegant rural manors and lodges.  A tall, red-haired woman in a forest-green riding habit, a hint of elven heritage evident in the curve of her ears and her haughty bearing, glances over a leather-bound registry as she nods instructions to the workmen who hurry in and out of the room by the rear entrance."
