    "The trail opens up into a clearing bounded by huge stones ringing a pool of water.  Lichens and vivid green moss mottle the stones, growing to the brink of the water's edge in a thick mantle.  The pool is still and deep, bounded on the west by a high escarpment of granite that throws a shadow across the water's surface."
