  "description": [
    "More of a store cupboard than a functional room, the snug alcove is filled with all manner of hunting trophies.  Mounted animal heads loom over distressed leather armchairs and dusty lepidoptera display cases.  The sidetables are cluttered with glass-domed stuffed birds and stacks of tattered leather books.  A beeswax candle casts a meager light over an antique counter in the corner on which sits a locker and a slate blackboard."
