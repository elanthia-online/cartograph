  "description": [
    "Leafless boughs of mangled hawthorn draped with amber lanterns arc over the surroundings, casting faint shadows across the wide pool of a steaming hot spring, its surface burbling with a bevy of bubbles.  Sinuous coils of a two-headed copper serpent statue wind their way through cinnabar slate rocks jutting up from the water, its moist, patinated scales reflecting in the scant daylight.  Low crops of bulrush are strewn around the water's edge, their vertical canes resplendent with drops of moisture.  To the north, a passageway through the haw leads to a glaes-bound mithril door at the face of the mountain.",
    "Bare boughs of mangled hawthorn draped with amber lanterns arc over the surroundings, throwing dark shadows across a wide pool of a steaming hot spring, its surface gently roiling.  Sinuous coils of a two-headed copper serpent statue wind their way through the cinnabar slate rocks jutting up from the water, its patinated scales awash in a faint, warm glow.   Low crops of bulrush dot the edges, their vertical canes resplendent with drops of moisture.  To the north, a barely discernible route leads further into the haw toward a glaes-bound mithril door at the face of the mountain."
