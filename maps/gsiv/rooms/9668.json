  "description": [
    "Tall mahogany shelves house numerous texts and tomes, the highest of which can only be accessed by a sliding ladder.  Situated around the library are several glass display cases, housing a few tokens of remembrance from the Aelotoi homeworld.  Cozy, ruby-hued armchairs and lacquered reading tables have been arranged near the windows along the far wall, looking out over the inn's indoor garden."
