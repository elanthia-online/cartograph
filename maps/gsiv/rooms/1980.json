    "An ethereal silence looms along this corridor of stone. Residents of Kharam-Dzu move solemnly about their business, as a pensive elven acolyte maintains a respectful watch.  To one side, an elaborate white marble arch decked with garlands leads to the wedding chapel.  A black marble arch solemnly ushers passing travelers to the altar of Lorminstra."
