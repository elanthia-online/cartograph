    "Deep azure walls enclose the shop on three sides, while white stucco columns line the open-air storefront.  Marking clear paths along the glossy teakwood floor are silken runners embroidered with liana and tropical orchids.  An eclectic array of mannequins have been carefully arranged throughout the well-decorated area, artfully displaying the fine garments for sale."
