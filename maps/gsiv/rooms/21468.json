    "Dusty mauve canvas haphazardly drapes from a dry-rotted wooden tent frame.  A myriad of patchwork from leftover fabrics and roughly sewn thread has been used to repair years of apparent neglect.  In the center of the room stands a stout headless male mannequin opposite a slender headless female mannequin.  The tent's flap has been tightly rolled and secured to the side of the entryway with a thick strand of frayed rope."
