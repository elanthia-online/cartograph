  "description": [
    "The grass in this area is uniform in both length and hue, creating a breathtaking panacea of emerald green.  An ornate wooden fence encircles the meadow in dazzling white, and each span of the fence contains a different equestrian silhouette at its center.  Each post in the fence is topped with a brass lion, brightly polished and facing outward, placid and regal.  At the far end of the meadow, a wide white barn with deep umber accents can be seen."
