    "The broad sweep of the wooden floor is interrupted by a handblown double-heart bottle.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the polished oak walls.  A gilded maple table and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
