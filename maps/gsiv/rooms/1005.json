  "description": [
    "A huge monument dominates the center of this donut-shaped confluence of avenues.  Several dwarven warriors, rendered in gleaming white marble, battle a dozen orcs, depicted in black obsidian.  Several stone benches rest around the monument, facing outward in a circular pattern, while other benches sit on the outer edges of the circle, facing the monument.  Wide streets lead in from the north, south, east and west, and each thoroughfare is lined with luminescent toadstools in wide stone pots."
