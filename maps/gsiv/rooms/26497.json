  "description": [
    "Cots of thick, dried grass lay close to the sandy ground in the confines of this thatchwork tent, providing makeshift respite for the infirmed.  From within a small, dug out firepit, wide bundles of sage release their wafting, pungent aromatics into the air.  A small driftwood cabinet off to the side is stacked with plates, cups, food, and brews.  A seeping indigo-grey mist continuously winds itself around every object in the hut, periodically gathering itself near a large bloodstain in one corner."
