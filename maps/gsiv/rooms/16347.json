    "Glaesine orbs dangle from the ceiling and cast rainbow swirls upon the various wares on display upon the wide oak shelves that line the walls.  Tiny hooks house chains and pendants, while jewelry trees arranged on long tables display earrings, bracelets, and rings.  A plum-hued carpet stretches from this section of the shop into the central foyer.",
    "Glaesine orbs dangle from the ceiling and cast rainbow swirls upon the various wares on display upon the wide driftwood shelves that line the pale violet walls.  Gem-inlaid jewelry trees shaped like tropical flowers are arranged on long green tables, displaying items that glitter in the colorful light.  A plum-hued carpet stretches from this section of the shop into the central foyer."
