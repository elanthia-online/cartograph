  "description": [
    "A plush pale pink rug covers the majority of the plank flooring.  Spanning across the far wall, a wide four-poster bed carved from magnolia wood is dressed with vibrant red and white bedding.  Issuing a shadowy, flickering illumination, copper sconces are lit with dim flames, several of which are clustered around a narrow door.  Behind a tall armchair and a rustic table, the outline of a door, minus a knob and hinges, is barely discernable in the framework."
