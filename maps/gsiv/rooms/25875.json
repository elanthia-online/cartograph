    "Flooding the area with moonlight, polished casement windows stretch from floor to ceiling along the northern wall.  A thick elven-crafted rug patterned in an intricate lor leaf design partially covers the villswood floor, while nicely complementing two window seats upholstered in a pale brocade, a delicate lor side table, and matching bookcase.  A carved lor archway leads east into the library, while a vaalin inlaid oak door leads west to the private living quarters."
