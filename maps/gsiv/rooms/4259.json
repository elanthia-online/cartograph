  "description": [
    "A cliff rises through the treetops here, and rude steps have been carved into its face, leading upwards.  Beside the bottom of the cliff is a cairn, but it is hard to tell whether this cairn marks the final resting place of a fellow explorer, or is just the refuse of the stonework completed in the cliff face."
