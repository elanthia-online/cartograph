    "The scent of creosote and tar still pervades this room which once was used to store boat repair supplies.  Lumps of old tar litter the floor and walls, being flung haphazardly around the room by someone or something in a frenzy.  A coil of rope once used to stuff into cracks and leaks looks ready to crumble into dust at a touch."
