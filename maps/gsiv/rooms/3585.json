    "The sanctum is large, with walls constructed of immense stone slabs.  Against the back wall stands an enormous statue, which guards the room wearing a stoic expression.  The wide southern entrance admits light, enough to bathe the place in a hazy gloom animated with shifting shadows.  They play over the colossus, giving it the appearance of movement every now and then.  A crevice on the northwest wall gives access to an adjacent chamber."
