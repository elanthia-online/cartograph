    "Tapered logs lay in disorganized piles against the tall starboard bulwark, some dangling precariously over the edge of the deck where the bulwark is interrupted to allow the heavy wooden ballista free movement.  Erratic geometric patterns are carved in the aft-facing railings, while the support beams are carved to resemble avian shapes."
