    "A panoramic mural of Maelstrom Bay covers the walls of this long hallway.  Beneath the mural sit soft leather benches dyed a deep burgundy.  Plush velvet draperies frame the north entrance to this hallway, and proudly displayed at the opposite end is a silver shield bearing the coat of arms of the Beacon Hall Archives."
