  "description": [
    "Fallen boulders cant at precarious angles within a span of stalactites and stalagmites, creating a crumbling stone bridge rising up over a channel of water, and making it a dangerous proposition to cross.  A violent churning within the depths of the stream brings a boiling fury of bubbles to the top, then it subsides.  A moment later, it begins anew in a different spot."
