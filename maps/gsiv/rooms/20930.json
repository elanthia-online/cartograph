    "Continuing from the west, an eroding line of boulders outlines the end of the deep jungle.  Moisture gathers at the top of the rock formation and trickles down a timeworn path.  The small fall of water ends in a pool-like basin.  The fine mist from above falls gently, covering the area with constant precipitation."
