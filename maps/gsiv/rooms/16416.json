    "Arched in four directions, the redwood tree is hollow and polished to a lustrous warm, reddish glow.  Tiny orbs set into the high ceiling provide ample light for any that wish to traverse the stairway, while sconces set on the right side of each entry provide illumination for the catwalks that lead to the various balconies that ring the inn."
