    "A deep green glow blankets this room and it takes only a moment to recognize its source -- the window on one wall has been covered with a heavy layer of vines.  Their only support is a thin lace curtain which strains under the immense weight.  Long thin tendrils of green reach out across the paneled walls, disappearing down into the cushions of an easy chair sitting near the fireplace.  A small table has been overturned, but beyond that, and the vines, there are few signs of anything amiss here."
