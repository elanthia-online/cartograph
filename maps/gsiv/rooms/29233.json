  "description": [
    "Scorched and disfigured trunks hold fast to their long-claimed patches of ground along the western edge of the weald.  Many of their past compatriots lay spawled across the earth, their scarred lengths felled by the forces of lightning strikes, fire, or wind.  A few young oaks, maples, and yews struggle to gain a foothold in the harsh, unforgiving terrain."
