    "Smooth black stone walls run north from a spiral staircase that winds upward and out of sight.  Several chairs and tables lie stacked to either side of the hallway, forcing a narrow passage between them.  Behind the makeshift barricade, skeletons in timeworn uniforms and rusting armor lie sprawled across the ground in a mess of broken and discarded weapons."
