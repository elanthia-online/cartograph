    "An array of crystals hangs from the ceiling of this room and dazzles you with a rainbow of lights.  As your eyes slowly adjust, you see that they are reflecting the light from the full height windows spaced around the walls of this tower room.  Blinking to clear the last of the stars from your eyes, you notice a circular workbench set in the center of the room."
