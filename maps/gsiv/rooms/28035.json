    "A hastily constructed open-air stall is draped with a sunbleached canvas awning, providing a small swath of protection from the elements.  Along the front of the stall, open wooden crates are turned facing toward the road to give passersby a preview of the merchandise on offer.  An old wine barrel sits at the end of a long counter along the back wall, upon which a fuzzy white kitten has taken up residence in a woven reed basket filled with scraps of cloth."
