    "An intricate knot-worked wall-hanging hangs on one of the textured red silk walls, and a high arched ceiling rises overhead.  A wyvern painted ivory vase sits in one corner of a parquet red maple floor.  There is a carved oak table on one side of the shop and a twisted dark metal rack on the other."
