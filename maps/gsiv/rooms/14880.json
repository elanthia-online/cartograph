    "Not as lush and colorful as the rest, this part of the garden is dominated by a larger-than-life statue of two female warriors with their arms wrapped around each other's shoulders in easy camaraderie.  A green lawn, sprinkled with small white daisies and bright yellow buttercups, surrounds the base of the statue."
