    "Walls painted the subtle hues of a desert sunset, and overlaid with wind-blown cloud wisps, are illuminated by diffuse rays of moonlight that saturate the room through frosted glass windows etched with the alchemical symbol for wind.  Resembling metal box kites, wall sconces cradle pillar candles whose flickering flames glitter off eagle feathers inlaid in azure ceramic tile flooring.  The musical tinkling of a wind chime can be heard from high above the brushed steel workbench as gentle breezes trickle in from the piazza.",
