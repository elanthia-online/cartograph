    "The pearlwort carpeting blends with a thick blanket of pachysandra, its glossy emerald leaves a stark contrast to the pearlwort's delicate white flowers.  Bright blue mournblooms trail from several ironwork posts surrounding a white marble statue.  A quartz-inlaid white marble bench sits beneath a nearby hawthorn tree."
