    "Stout pillars of golden oak march in even intervals along this section of hallway, framing three stained glass windows high in the clerestory.  The brightly hued sunlight from the windows plays upon a wall tapestry woven in the vibrant colors of summer.  The hallway continues its downward slope to the west, but the darkness in that direction obscures the view below.",
