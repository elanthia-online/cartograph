    "Beneath a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling, an elaborately faenor-framed portrait hangs on one of the polished ebonwood plank walls.  An oversized sea chest and a vine-carved mahogany table sit in opposite corners while a writing desk arrayed with various nautical maps rests on a sturdy planked floor."
