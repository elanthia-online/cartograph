    "Tiny bubbles and squishy sounds are emitted from the moisture-laden soil with any passing footsteps of trespassers on this land.  The earthy aroma of decomposing organic matter hangs heavily in the still air.  Overhead, a lush canopy of cypress branches thrives on the nutrient rich miasma.  Narrow game trails nearby skirt the edges of the deepest pools of standing water."
