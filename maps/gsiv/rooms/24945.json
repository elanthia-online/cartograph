  "description": [
    "From a towering gate in the north, rows of houses crowd both sides of a dirt road leading up to the village square.  The cobblestones at this end of the square are a faded yellow, though tiny flecks of gold suggest that it once was a dazzling, golden thoroughfare.  A small garden, filled with a few scraggly bushes and a timeworn stone slab, marks the entrance to the village plaza."
