    "The dark plank flooring is worn in many places by frequent use and surrounded on all sides by pale yellow-painted walls.  A recessed brick fireplace faces the arch leading back out, while a long wooden counter holds a wash basin, a bread box, and two built-in cupboards.  Lit beeswax candles rest on the spindly-legged table, casting a warm glow on the room, and a fat orange tabby cat sleeps on one of the matching chairs."
