    "The western view from the widow's walk is much more somber, looking out over nature in a more raw state.  Rolling waves crash against The Fang, the breakwater jutting south into Solhaven Bay, protecting the harbor from the rough Western Sea.  Off to the southwest, the sparkling sands and vertical pilings of the Kraken Sands glint in the sunlight.",
    "The western view from the widow's walk is much more somber, looking out over nature in a more raw state.  Rolling waves crash against The Fang, the breakwater that protects the Solhaven Bay harbor to the south, subtly visible in the dark-on-dark of the night sky and the rough Western Sea.  Off to the southwest, the sparkling Kraken Sands occasionally glint in the moonlight."
