    "Markedly different from the other room in the tent, this octagonal space is quite clean and free of the beastly chaos of the salesroom.  Thickly piled carpeting of a scarlet hue covers the floor, obscured in many spots by large, particolored black and white floor cushions.  A heavy black velvet curtain blocks the view of the rest of the tent, muffling the sound surprisingly well."
