    "Two ebony chairs sit to either side of a matching table.  An elaborately carved mithril lamp hangs over the table.  A large bed sits on a black pedestal and is covered with a matching coverlet.  Spread on the floor in front of a roaring fireplace is a rug made from the pelt of a black bear of tremendous size."
