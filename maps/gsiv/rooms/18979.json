    "A trio of giant luminescent toadstools resides upon the landing, casting each third of the area in a slightly different hued light.  Thin veins of crystal weave across the stone walls, creating fanciful patterns against the darker rock.  The floor is punctuated by a few stout stalagmites around the perimeter."
