    "Shelves of books fill this room, lining the walls and standing in the middle of the floor to form narrow aisles.  Uncounted years of rats and mice and cold and damp and dust have taken their toll, to the point where the books fall apart at a touch.  Pity -- some of the titles look VERY interesting."
