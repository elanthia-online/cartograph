  "description": [
    "Puffs of foul-smelling steam rise from a pot of simmering, scum-covered liquid resting atop an ancient cast-iron stove, condensing on the formerly whitewashed walls to form dripping, greasy smears.  A stained wooden counter stands along one wall, a row of iron hooks hanging above it, and a heap of filthy rags and aprons in the corner occasionally twitches with the explorations of hungry vermin."
