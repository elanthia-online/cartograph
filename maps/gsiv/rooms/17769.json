  "description": [
    "A large painted panel shows the dramatic skill of the artist and his intimate appreciation of the cavern's quirks, shown to good effect in one corner where a single line of deer heads in profile is painted just above a ledge.  The ledge is worked into the composition as a river, through which the beautifully drawn herd is swimming, antlered heads uplifted against the current.  The crystalline deposits in the walls and ceiling gleam with a warm and welcomed light."
