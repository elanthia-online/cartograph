    "Animal pens fill the yards between stone cottages flanking the passageway to the village square.  Behind one home, a scarecrow in tattered clothing peeks out of an untended garden overgrown with sickly, black carrion flowers.  A pine tree, nearly seventy feet tall, has toppled over and crashed through the thatched roof of one cottage, its tangle of roots and earth blocking part of the lane."
