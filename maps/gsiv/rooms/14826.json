    "The white rock path leads through a short-hedge maze, twisting and turning around itself in a confusing fashion.  Dainty red flowers bloom on the walls of the squared-off bushes, a perfect counterpoint to the marble sculptures and fountains that hide in the puzzle.  Visitors can lose themselves for hours within, although help lies close by from the gardeners tending to the constant pruning that keeps the attraction in shape."
