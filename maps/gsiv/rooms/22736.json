  "description": [
    "Splintered bark and broken limbs litter the viscous ground around a stunted black willow tree.  Discolored leaves precariously cling to branches, though a greater number lie scatted about the mud.  Upturned tufts of wildrye grass display their intricate root systems to the sky along edge of the watercourse, their blue-green blades barely touching the scum-covered liquid."
