    "Recent renovations are apparent in this small shop, from the new tile floor to a rather pristine wood-paneled walls.  The tang of metal and faint scent of oil linger in the air, drifting over from the neighboring forge.  A small burnished counter stands before several organized racks that display the numerous weapons for sale."
