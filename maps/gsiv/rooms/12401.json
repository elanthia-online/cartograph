    "Someone has erected a monument here.  At least, it might be a monument.  It might also be a huge pile of dirt.  Running about its base are a trio of rag-clad young humans waving sticks overhead, apparantly engaged in a nonstop round of \"Knights and Goblins.\"  Seated on a crate across the way, an old matron keeps one eye on her small, leather book and the other on her budding heroes and monsters."
