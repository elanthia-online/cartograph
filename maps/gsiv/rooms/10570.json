  "description": [
    "In the midst of the dark trees is a circular area surrounded by black and silver painted rocks.  Inside the circle, all undergrowth, leaves and branches have been cleared and burned to leave only the bare soil.  A pool of reddish-brown liquid had been spilled onto the soil in the center of the circle at some point in the past, leaving it slightly darker than the surrounding dirt."
