    "A wall-mounted blowfish hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A colorful seashell collection sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is an oversized sea chest on one side of the shop and some hammered copper display hooks on the other."
