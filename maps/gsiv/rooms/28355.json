  "description": [
    "A set of stairs leads down into darkness, the silver and onyx elegance of the main hall giving way to rougher stone as they descend, curving with the outer wall.  A dark marble arch on the inner wall faces a narrow spiral staircase leading up to the balcony above.  A single black doomstone adorns the end of each polished rail of the staircase."
