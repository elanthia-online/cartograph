    "Set beneath a canopy of faded black linen curtains is a mid-sized four-poster bed with a high carved headboard of thick black walnut.  Twin nightstands rest to either side bed, while a large oval mirror with a twisted gold frame stands against one wall.  Long black curtains frame a large bay window that overlooks the square outside, though the view is mostly obscured by a layer of filth on the glass."
