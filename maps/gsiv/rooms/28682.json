    "Rough stone blocks stacked in a cylindrical pattern create a grey stone beacon tower that climbs up out of the wilderness.  Wood is piled high in a triangular pattern under the conical roof.  A strong iron ladder gives access to the fuel above and next to it is a bin of torches.  Hanging from a hook imbedded in the wall is a lit copper brazier.  A wild tangle of fragrant blossoms gives way to a smooth sandy path that leads back to the main trail."
