    "Though this room is typical in many ways for the private workspace of a tailor or seamstress, it is relatively dark, and the omnipresent mist of Caligos Isle seems to collect and writhe around itself very slowly in one corner.  In an opposite corner, a long table is covered with a disorganized collection of pins and strips of fabric.  Beside the table stands an antique dressmaker's dummy wearing only an unfinished scarf.  A single, large candle with a leaping flame dominates the center of the room."
