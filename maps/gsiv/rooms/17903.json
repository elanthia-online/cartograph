    "Shallow carvings adorn the black marble, creating mesmerizing designs of light and shadow in the presence of strategically placed luminescent toadstools.  The corridors meet at a t-junction, where a huge carved red jasper has been set into the gold-sheened lintel above a pair of ornately carved white granite doors."
