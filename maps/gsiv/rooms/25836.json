    "Lanes of trimmed lush grass stretch across both sides of the courtyard, and tall rose bushes line each wall.  Polished riverstone fountains rise up on each side of a white pebblestone walkway that snakes from a high rolaren gate to a pair of dark mahogany doors.  Burnished wooden benches form half-circles around each fountain."
