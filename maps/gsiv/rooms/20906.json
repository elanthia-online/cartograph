    "A thin mist floats close to the treetops here, offering but a hazy glimpse of the leafy canopy above.  Humid air envelopes everything like a blanket, causing the dampness to cling to the vegetation.  The ground is spongy, covered in layers of rotting greenery.  One particularly massive rosewood tree shows signs in its outer bark covering of many types of fungal infestations."
