    "Dove grey-colored walls provide a neutral backdrop for racks of clothes, all neatly organized by color and style.  Several linden workstations are spaced out on the floor, the silver veining in the cream marble tiles accentuating the cool tones of the other fixtures and fittings.  Hung on either side of the archway are a series of concept boards, each filled with a composition of ink sketches and fabric samples.  A pair of glass doors offer an inviting glimpse of a moonlit orangery beyond."
