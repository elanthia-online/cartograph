  "description": [
    "The inside of the wooden booth provides just enough space to allow shoppers to sample the wares set out upon a few low wooden shelves.  Tacked onto the far wall of the booth is a sign that reads, \"Walward's Eastern Emporium.\"  A stout wooden stool rests just at the edge of the area, a pile of wood carvings littered around it."
