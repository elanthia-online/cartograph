    "Utilitarian and sparse, the room smells strongly of cedar and pipe tobacco.  Maps are pinned to the rough oak walls, covering the space between a dark green chalkboard and a bulletin board filled with parchments.  A small desk and chair in the northeastern corner sit at an angle to take full advantage of the room's two windows."
