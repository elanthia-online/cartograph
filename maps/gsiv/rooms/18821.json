    "Swarms of tiny moths flit about in the moonlight, attracting the occasional bat to swoop in from the higher ground to the west.  The dense reeds and bog grasses make travel difficult, but the river seems not too far to the northeast.",
    "Swarms of tiny, biting insects buzz about without ceasing, searching for any exposed bit of flesh to provide them with their next meal.  The dense reeds and bog grasses make travel difficult, but the river seems not too far to the northeast."
