    "The walls of the warehouse are left unpainted, their rough-hewn plank sides apparently made of pine, given the fragrance.  The warm, pale color of the pine siding indicates the newness of the building.  A small office sits to the west while a steady stream of townsfolk and shoppers head due east."
