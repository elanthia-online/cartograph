    "The footpath narrows and cuts back sharply in this small, bramble-filled hollow.  Scattered among the spiky brambles are ragged bits of cloth and tufts of fur, the evidence of people and creatures who have been less careful passing by.  A rather putrid stench suggests that some small, unfortunate creature has crawled under the brambles and died."
