    "The hillside rises to a small summit to the southeast.  Lizards skitter about the area, stopping to survey the interlopers that have invaded their area before zooming under the nearest rock.  The moons shine down from a cloudless sky, and a warm, stiff breeze sweeps across the hillside, raising dust in small tornadoes as it goes.  It is pleasantly warm here, albeit a bit dry.  The lizards seem to like it, though.",

The sunlight beats down from a cloudless sky, but its heat is counteracted by a stiff breeze that sweeps across the hillside, raising dust in small tornadoes as it goes.  It is pleasantly warm here, albeit a bit dry.  The lizards seem to like it, though."
