    "The black dunes grow larger to the north, obscuring the view of the coastline.  To the south, smaller dunes support struggling grasses.  A huge, pillar-shaped boulder rises from the beach near the cliffs here.  The boulder is broken near the base and leans against the cliff face.",

A huge, pillar-shaped boulder rises from the beach near the cliffs here.  The boulder is broken near the base and leans against the cliff face, providing a bit of cool shade on the otherwise sun-scorched beach."
