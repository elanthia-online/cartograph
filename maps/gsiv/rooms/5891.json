    "A carpet of green grass fills the area, only interrupted by a scattering of fallen leaves.  A nearby monir seems to be the source of the leaves.  The tree's branches are regularly trimmed to keep them from hanging too low.  To the south, the path begins a gentle ascent up a hillside.",

The tree's branches are regularly trimmed to keep them from hanging too low.  To the south, the path begins a gentle ascent up a hillside.  The monir's branches sway menacingly in the night air."
