    "Pink marble columns streaked with white quartz, black obsidian, and flecks of silvery mica hide beneath a lattice roof thickly covered with honeysuckle vines.  Sheltered by the trees that hug the creek at the base of the cliffs, the small arbor hides from the moonlight, yet still gazes out over the meadow domed with a star-filled sky.  The susurrus of rushing water nearby marks a small trailhead to the south.",

Sheltered by the trees that hug the creek at the base of the cliffs, the small arbor is protected from the bright sun much of the day.  The susurrus of rushing water nearby marks a small trailhead to the south."
