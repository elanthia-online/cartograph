    "A huge fire pit dominates the center of this room, large enough to roast a wild boar.  To one side are a two oversized cast iron baking ovens, beside which hang large wooden paddles used to handle loaves of hot bread, and a blackened krodera-veined cauldron rests on squat legs.  Numerous pots and pans dangle from hooks overhead, and the large china cabinet holds enough tableware for a small army of hungry patrons.  There appears to be a small cage or pen built into the south wall, with a thick chain securing the door."
