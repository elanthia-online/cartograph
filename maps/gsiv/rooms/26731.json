    "Tiny rivers have bored their way through the shale walls forming divots and dips throughout the broad, ebony expanses.  Wrought iron shepherd's crooks are planted into the spongey ground, their curved tops holding glass and wire lanterns that fill the area with a bright light.  A row of pews, their backs to the entry, provides seating for visitors, while an open space in front of them has space for various activities to unfold."
