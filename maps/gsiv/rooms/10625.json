    "The trail breaks from the deep cover of oak trees just as it reaches the top of a small but high hill.  From that vantage, one can see numerous trails snaking off into the distance.  One trail descends into the river bottom to the northwest.  A second path, to the north, climbs a rocky ridge.  The third traces to the northeast before plunging into a dense forest of towering elms.  The others fork to east and west before disappearing beneath the oaks halfway down the hill to the south."
