  "description": [
    "A carved oak armoire and a polished oak writer's desk are pushed up against the wall opposite the door.  Scarlet red drapes stifle nearly all of the light from the outside.  Tall white candles in iron candlesticks add a soft light to the room.  A dark, iron-framed bed lies under the window, the covers turned down and pillow fluffed perfectly at the head."
