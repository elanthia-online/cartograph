    "An oil-filled silver sconce hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls, and a dark and light oak ceiling rises overhead.  An iron candelabra sits in one corner of an ash grey granite floor.  There is an open-front willow display case on one side of the shop and a claw-footed wide mahogany desk on the other."
