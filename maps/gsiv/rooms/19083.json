    "[Spitfire, Coach House Pantry]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The pantry is small, apparently leaving most of the real preparation of victuals to the galley on the main deck.  A polished maple table sits against the bulkhead, along with a couple of barrels.  Racks of utensils line the bulwarks and a large stack of baskets takes most of the remaining space.  These are filled with tarts and various other pastries.  The business of sailing the Spitfire must work up a considerable taste for sweets."
