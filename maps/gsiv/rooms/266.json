    "A respectful quiet blankets this area like the deep shadow cast by the high north wall.  Those people that move along this section of road walk with their heads bowed and speak in hushed whispers in obvious consideration to the local empath, who practices the restorative arts at the strange tent that is set back from the roadside in the middle of an overgrown vacant lot here."
