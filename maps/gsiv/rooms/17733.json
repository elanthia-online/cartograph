    "A large flat area extends to the southeast populated by majestic oaks and stately magnolias, and a small honeysuckle vine clambers over one of the oaks to fill the air with a sweet aroma.  In other directions patchy bluegrass covers the ground for several yards until it slopes down into the impassable black swamp waters.  Various forms of exercise and training equipment reside in several sections, and two weeping willows stand a short distance away with a leather table resting in the shade of each.",
