    "A pair of crossed bones hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls, and an ebonwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is an intricately carved ebonwood stand on one side of the shop and a spacious grey slate counter on the other."
