  "description": [
    "The north wall of the game room is made entirely of rough stone, its focalpoint a mammoth fireplace, over which hangs a crimson banner embroidered with the golden wyvern crest of House Vaalor.  The west wall boasts a dart board mounted next to a polished wooden rack, offering an opportunity for soldiers to let off a little steam in friendly, if fiercely competitive, games."
