  "description": [
    "This cozy bedroom smells of sweet incense with an undertone of chocolate.  The lovely rosewood and maoral floor is uncovered, while the walls are liberally draped with silk from the palest green to the deep verdant hues of the forest.  A large comfortable bed rests in a corner next to a full length mirror.  Above the bed hangs a large painting."
