    "Marching from the lobby to the end of the hallway, fossil-pocked limestone columns provide a framework for the panoramic windows and barrel-vaulted ceiling.  Marble-framed alcoves, each filled with a statue, rise within the bones of the corridor and have woven reed prayer mats positioned before them, which promotes silent contemplation."
