  "description": [
    "A solid wall of etched stone surrounds this derelict clearing.  Malignant, low hanging fog creates a ceiling of dripping miasma that coats everything in a noisome mist.  Beneath a malformed cocobolo tree lie the shards of tiny, broken headstones, inscribed not with names, but with crude, childlike drawings of small animals."
