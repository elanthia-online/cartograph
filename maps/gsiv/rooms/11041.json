    "The oft-trodden dirt path snakes around grassy knolls in this wide-open meadow.  Views from the small rises reveal a building off in the distance southeast of here.  A wide, meandering creek keeps travellers company as they make their way to their destination, while benches made of tanik and stone provide a scenic resting place by the water's edge for the weary.  A southwest turn in the path heads further into the meadow."
