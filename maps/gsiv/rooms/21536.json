    "Brilliantly aglow with a dazzling array of lanterns, the clothing section is spotless.  Some intricately carved oak stands line the east and west walls.  Several racks on either side display tiny articles of clothing.  The deep crimson rug edged with intricate gold threading continues in from the south maintaining the central aisle from which to browse the accessories.  Hanging from the ceiling is an ornate gilt sign."
