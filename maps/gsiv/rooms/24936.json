    "Thick, flowerless vines crawl up the sides of a two-story inn with yellow shutters and a balcony overlooking a plaza to the west.  On the inn's front porch, several chairs huddle together around a small stove in between a pair of spruce-carved doors with peeling green paint.  A tarnished brass bell hangs from a low branch of a lemon tree in the yard."
