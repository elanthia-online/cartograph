    "Nestled amongst creeping trumpet and wisteria vines and drawn back from the beaten path, the gazebo's copper ceiling reflects sunlight upon the polished white birch dance floor.  Benches are arranged in a semi-circle around its smooth steps to create a quiet resting area to relax in.  The ebb and flow of the distant ocean punctuates the chorus of birdsong, while a gentle breeze is warm with the day's heat.",
    "Nestled amongst creeping trumpet and wisteria vines and drawn back from the beaten path, the gazebo's copper ceiling dangles painted paper lanterns in the shape of large orbs over a polished white birch dance floor.  Benches are arranged in a semi-circle around its smooth steps and create a quiet resting area to relax in.  The ebb and flow of the distant ocean punctuates the quiet chirp of crickets and cicada, while a soothing breeze cools the air."
