    "The walls of this room are bathed in blood, its sticky crimson fluid dripping even from the ceiling.  Cold, stone slabs create a row of makeshift tables in the center of the area, while an assortment of limbs and other body parts have fallen to their sides.  A spectral figure floats about the room, giggling to himself as he moves through the shadows."
