    "Rich panels of wood covering the walls are lit by faintly glowing orbs that dangle from crisscrossing overhead beams.  An elderly man sits on an uprooted, sawed-off fir stump vigilantly polishing a longbow, glancing up only momentarily to acknowledge your presence.  Just beside him rests a cracked mahogany coffer."
