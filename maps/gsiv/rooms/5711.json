    "A middle-aged man wearing a bushy salt-and-pepper beard and a sour expression stands behind a modwir counter that bears the rounded edges and marring of a thousand transactions.  The cracked and yellowed plaster walls, dilapidated counter and the appearance of the proprietor suggest a distinctly Dwarven influence, if not lineage."
