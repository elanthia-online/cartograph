  "description": [
    "As steep as it is dark, this rocky slope is difficult to traverse without sending loose debris skittering off into the darkness.   The occasional distant *plop* is the only way to tell which steep side leads down to the black sea below.  Waves battering themselves against the rocky coastline drown out the rest of the area's prevalent nocturnal noises.",
    "The steep climb inherent on this rocky slope is difficult to traverse without sending loose debris skittering off into the distance.   The occasional *plop* indicates yet another rock that has met a watery grave in the black sea below.  Waves battering themselves against the rocky coastline drown out all but the most insistent cries of sea birds and the bellowing of a group of male sea lions.",
    "Perched roughly fifty feet above the water's surface and twenty feet out from the main path, this slender outcropping provides access to one of the few sections of the surrounding sea that is not hampered by hazardous rocks.  With no security barriers to prevent a fall, the precarious perch offers no protection from high winds or walking mishaps and is not for the faint of heart."
