    "A large fallen log rests underneath the towering forms of several of its companion trees, its roughened jagged-edged body illuminated with pale moonlight that filters in through the breaks in the trees.  Crickets chirp incessantly amongst patches of moonflowers, their loud calls mingling with the occasional rustle of a nocturnal creature moving about the foliage.  The presence of an occasional breeze, wafting in from the nearby river, accentuates the cooler temperature of the jungle during the night hours.",
    "A large fallen log rests underneath the shade of several of its companion trees, its roughened jagged-edged body covered in an array of vines and insects.  Butterflies flutter in and out of small patches of wildflowers flourishing near the edge of the jungle, their jewel-toned wings creating a subtle, yet distinctive, buzz in the humid air.  The presence of an occasional breeze, wafting in from the nearby river, alleviates the discomfort of the sauna-like surroundings."
