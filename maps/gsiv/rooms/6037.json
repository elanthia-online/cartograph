    "The ground slopes downward to the southwest and becomes soggier in that direction.  Rainwater cascading from the huge boulder has furrowed the soil as it rushed southwestward, carrying dirt particles with it and leaving small channels of gravel and exposed stones.  For the time being the erosion is minor, but more rains could easily undermine the entire section and destroy all the turnips planted here."
