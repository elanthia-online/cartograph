    "A musky scent, strong and wild, rides the light breeze.  The oak trees rustle with its presence, as if some fierce beast walked in their midst.  Although nothing is distinct, the sensation of being watched from the darkness of the surrounding foliage is unmistakable.  To the south, a small clearing opens in the woods, just visible under the dim light of the night sky.",

Although nothing is distinct, the sensation of being watched from the shadows of the surrounding foliage is unmistakable.  To the south, a small clearing opens in the woods, the rounded edge of a hut or cabin visible through the lightly swaying branches."
