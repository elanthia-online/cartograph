    "Light maple paneling compliments the sparkling silver carpeting in this stately library.  Long, heavy, white tables with silver footrests extend down the center of this expansive room, and silver chandeliers provide ample lighting.  Dozens of tall bookcases carry much of the written knowledge of the lands, including many volumes in foreign tongues.  At the north end of the room, a stern-looking librarian keeps a careful eye on those studying from his vantage point at a small wooden desk."
