  "description": [
    "Bursts of molten, orange-red magma bubble up from the center of the ever-expanding terrace.  Once ejected from hidden tubes deep within the earth, the viscous lava flows across the black and crackled surface, adding additional depth to the cooled pathways along the terraced perimeter.  Steam rises in plumes from pockets of cooling crust near a porous lava rock fissure, and a fine-grained ash chokes the air before being wafted away by the incoming sea breezes."
