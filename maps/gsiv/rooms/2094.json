  "description": [
    "This plant was once a large fish processing plant.  You can see a number of large vats designed to hold the catch.  This room is where the fresh fish would be brought for sorting and processing.  A chute in the north wall would have allowed the fish to slide into this room from a ship moored just outside the building."
