    "The din of BriarStone Court is barely discernable from this distance, as the cacophony drifts across rooftops and between buildings.  To the south, the peacefulness of Greyar Wey beckons.  Torches mounted upon thin iron stakes line the var, casting just enough light to walk by.",
    "A small school, with a tetrastyle portico of columns, sits close to the var.  The building is topped with a sapphire-tiled dome, atop which a silver-on-white pennon flies.  The cobblestones come almost up to the building's steps, separated by a thin rime of grass."
