    "A stand of parkia trees grows alongside the trail as it meanders between the tall trunks of Greymist and the swamp neighboring it to the north.  The parkias are covered with bright red globular flowers, which cascade down the long stalks and give off a heady perfume.  Heavy odors from the marsh mingle with the sweet scent of the blossoms, creating an eloquent atmospheric statement of growth and death within the jungle."
