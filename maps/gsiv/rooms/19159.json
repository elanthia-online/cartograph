    "Painted upon the smooth walls is an expansive mural depicting a horde of glistening treasure.  The white sand that graces the floor in the rest of the shop is present here.  One central spot in the chamber features a reclining, woven rattan chair and a bright red, standing umbrella with a plush green rug underfoot."
