    "A series of life-size sketches hang on the walls, each detailing the body and the various types and degrees of wounds that can be sustained.  Bandages and herbs are neatly stacked on a long monir table, while a large book sits open next to them.  Several velvet chairs face a cozy alabaster fireplace, and a blue wool rug is soft underfoot.  A silver-framed parchment sign is affixed to the wall above a white willow tray."
