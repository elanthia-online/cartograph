    "Mismatched sconces erratically line the walls, their flickering candles cast oddly formed shadows toward the warped wood ceiling.  Muffled carousing voices carry themselves though the stuffy air from the various off-shoots of rooms lining the hall, and the smell of ale permeates the small space.  A few broken peanut shells litter the floor near the far end of the hall."
