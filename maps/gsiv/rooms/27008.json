  "description": [
    "Whorls of purple and fuchsia invade the light of the red dome above, the glow bright enough to eclipse the area in its pulsating light.  High above, the source of the alien lights are twin nebulas that rise upon the northern horizon of Liabo and are encircled by seven brightly gleaming stars.  Nearer at hand, the terrain is smoothed by bright golden tiles that lead to a sunken crater ring encircled by red glass."
