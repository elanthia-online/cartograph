  "description": [
    "Gaps in the boards below reveal a dizzying drop to the jagged chasm floor.  The bridge sways with each footfall, and periodic shifts in the wind cause minor buffeting.  To the east, the chimney rock looms large against the sky.  The west end of the bridge is secured to a relatively small, flat mesa occupied by an unusual structure.  Rough-hewn stone pillars, far larger than the marker below, form a large circle around a central wood and stone building there."
