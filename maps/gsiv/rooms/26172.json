    "Brightly burning from its stone prison against the crenellation, a large fire supports a tripod housing an iron cauldron.  Waves of heat emanate from that section of the rampart and help to stave off the chill of the rushing winds.  A large rain barrel, charred from some past fire, sits near the ramp that leads to the floor below."
