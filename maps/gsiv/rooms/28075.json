    "Jasmine-perfumed smoke wafts upward from a circular silver and gold censer that is placed in the corner nook of the silken tent.  Tapered candles burn in iron-worked holders that flank an ivory marble worktable, illuminating a latticed bamboo bench that is nestled just behind the bright lighting."
