    "The hallway ends abruptly as half of the ceiling has collapsed on the eastern side, piles of rubble opening up a view of the mist-shrouded dark forest beyond.  One wall hosts a few old wooden frames, each one missing the original portrait inside.  In their place, small child-like sketches have been scratched into the wall within the empty frames.  At the end of the hall is an open doorway with rusty broken hinges."
