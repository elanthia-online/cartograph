    "The wispy tendrils of pale-grey cobwebs cling to the uppermost corners and crevasses in the twisting tunnels, their weavers apparently absent or hidden within the deep pockets of shadow surrounding them.  Although much of the tunnel system appears to have been created by the normal flow of water through the mountain, small chiseled supports and the rounding of certain corners remain as evidence of intelligent construction within the otherwise natural passage."
