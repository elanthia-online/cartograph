    "One leg of the colossus is immersed in the river and hidden from view by the muddy brown water.  The river churns along the length of stone that still remains above its surface, forming frothing whirlpools in the carved nooks and crannies of the statue, and grumbling mightily at its inability to engulf the rest of the mighty warrior within its depths."
