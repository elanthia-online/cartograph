    "Enclosed by star-speckled ebon glaes walls, the shop features a curved sapphire velvet sofa in the center of its honey oak floor.  A tall electrum looking glass hangs under the silk-tented ceiling.  Right near the front is a velvet-lined silver jewelry box and a bronze-framed clothing rack.",
    "A tall electrum looking glass hangs on one of the refurbished driftwood walls, and a low skylight-set ceiling rises overhead.  A curved sapphire velvet sofa sits in one corner of a carpet-topped honey oak floor.  There is a velvet-lined silver jewelry box on one side of the shop and a bronze-framed clothing rack on the other."
