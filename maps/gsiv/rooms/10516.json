    "Moonlight shines through the heavy fog that blankets the ground, making it appear as if the fog itself glows with an inner white light.  Yellow grass conceals fallen twigs and branches, which snap and crackle underfoot.  From a distance, the sounds of bubbling water and low growls fill the air.",
    "Yellow grass conceals fallen twigs and branches, which snap and crackle underfoot.  A heavy fog blankets the surrounding area, making it difficult to see more than a few feet at a time.  From a distance, the sounds of bubbling water and low growls fill the air."
