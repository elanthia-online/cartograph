    "Tall trees stand sentinel on both sides of the road, blanketing it with a thick layer of browned pine needles and other foliage.  Colorful streamers hanging from the branches of the trees dance wildly on the breeze.  Clumped beneath a few of the trees are mushrooms sporting mottled white egg-shaped caps.  Underneath this miniature forest of mushrooms, a white powder coats the ground.  A gated main entrance leads to the fairgrounds."
