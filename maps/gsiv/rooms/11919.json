  "description": [
    "The stump of a modwir tree sits in the middle of the path, its decaying wood soft with decay and riddled with termites.  Other trees in the area show signs of gnawing by industrious creatures with sharp teeth, most likely the handiwork of beavers seeking lumber for their dams and dens."
