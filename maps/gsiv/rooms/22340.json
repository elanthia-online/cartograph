  "description": [
    "Several small houses line the end of this neatly paved street, the road abruptly ending at the base of small hill.  The homes are well tended, and very clean, but there is not a single window without a curtain covering the glass.  Carved into the nearby slope, a smooth trail leads upward to Koar's Crown."
