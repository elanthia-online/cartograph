  "description": [
    "You are nearly bowled over by a large group of children dashing by on the cottage-lined street.  They seem to be chasing an impish lad who is carrying a small shoe and, as one of the pursuers has a single bare foot, you can see how the chase started.  Given the situation, you aren't certain who to root for.",
    "A cold wind bears the promise of a coming storm down the street.  Most of the cottages are quiet and dark, but here and there a candle burns in a window to light the way home."
