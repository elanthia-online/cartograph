    "What appears to be a huge mound of dirt from outside, actually slopes to a hole in the center, as though a rabid giant rodent had tunneled there, throwing dirt in all directions.  The hole is protected from the shifting earthy dunes by a sheath of rotting boards.  A confused mass of knotted ropes and pulleys dangles down into the darkness."
