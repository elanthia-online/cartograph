    "A grassy trail leads across the sparsely wooded hills to the northeast, nearly concealed by a patch of half-charred brush.  A spacious field stretches out to the southwest, its wild covering of weeds and scrub and neglected patches of wheat indicating that it has not been farmed in many years."
