    "Creeping vines of ivy twine along the gaps in the cobblestones underfoot, trailing towards the base of a large, gnarled oak tree upon the crest of a small, verdant green hill.  Pale ivory blossoms line the path, their thin petals casting a soft, bluish light over the grass as sunlight passes through them.",

Pale ivory blossoms line the path, their thin petals casting a ghostly bluish light over the grass as moonlight passes through them."
