    "The land slopes upward, and bare patches of dirt show through the overgrown grass that has a smattering of purple racemes peeking out across the pasture.  Dwarfed bramble dots the landscape, and thorny rosebushes are intertwined within the gaps of a split rail fence.  Propped atop the gate of the fence, the wooden statuette of a hulking male figure clutching a thick log tilts slightly to the left."
