    "An oil-filled gold sconce hangs on one of the midnight-hued ebonwood walls, and a domed ceiling rises overhead.  A large black marble fountain sits in one corner of a sweet-scented rush-covered floor.  There is a small white wicker display on one side of the shop and a large white wicker basket on the other."
