    "Iron sconces line the stone walls, barely illuminating the narrow entryway.  Within the center of the room, a glass-topped red marble counter is draped with a cloth that spills out toward the floor.  A dark beaded curtain on the northern wall leads toward the back of the structure, while two passageways fork off around the curtain."
