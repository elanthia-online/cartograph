    "Carved butterflies create a beautiful border for this large oval mirror, their bodies raised and life-like.  Saffron yellow wood dyes worked into the wood give the device and warm sunny coloring that is preserved behind clear polish.  An oddly formed tripod supports the device and also bears the carved talents of the original artist."
