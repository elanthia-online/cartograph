    "Colorful arbors laden with blooming plants are placed over the path that winds through the garden.  Benches are set to the side in semi-secluded nooks surrounded by shrubbery.  A clear glass roof peaks out above a verdant hedge row with a smoky glaes door placed between the thick bramble.  Beds filled with bright flowers cover the ground between blossoming trees, their heavy fragrance filling the air with a rich, sweet scent."
