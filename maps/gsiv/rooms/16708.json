  "description": [
    "Three beaten paths break off in a northerly direction, curving around a number of poorly built huts and tents.  A pile of broken bones and rotting flesh compete with a pile of steaming offal for the most nauseating odor available.  Over the top of the tents, a tall wooden flagpole marks the center of the warcamp just ahead, while a broad dirt path leads south to the sole entrance and exit of the encampment."
