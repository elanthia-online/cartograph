    "A banister of dark oak lines the southern edge of this carpeted loft, allowing only a glimpse of the keeper's office below.  Providing the loft with a sweeping view of Ta'Vaalor, three large windows take up the entire northern wall.  The two adjacent walls display shelves that overflow with books.  Glinting in candlelight shed from an ornate chandelier, a solid gold plaque has been set into the carpet at the head of the stairs."
