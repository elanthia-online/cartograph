    "A thick forest of fel, pine, and yew trees lies in both directions down the winding, well-kept path.  A few cottages stand along the border of the dark woods, situated so as to take advantage of the patch of sunlight here.  Wildflowers grow among patches of grass, and clinging vines cover the wrought-iron fence that surrounds the area."
