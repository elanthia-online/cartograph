  "description": [
    "A low brass rail ornaments the edges of the wagon's roof.  Polished to a glinting gleam and a mere six inches high, the rail's usefulness as a safety device is dubious.  From a pair of brass-trimmed vents drifts an aromatic air of barbershop smells: talc, oil of cloves, shaving soap.  The bracing scents are brief relief, soon corrupted by the noxious gases of the swamp."
