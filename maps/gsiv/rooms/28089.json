    "Thick woolen carpets woven in patterns of green and brown are layered on the floor, creating a soft covering.  Some fluffy pillows covered with rabbit pelts are scattered about a rough hewn wooden table.  Centered in the room is a hammered copper brazier, its beautiful surface shimmering with the smallest light.  Tucked to one side of the enclosure is a small woven basket filled with sticks, while standing to another is a beautifully carved maple tree."
