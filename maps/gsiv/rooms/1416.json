    "Named for the half-dozen gibbets that bear their hideous fruit just beyond its northern end, this bridge's heavy timbers stretch over the Cairnfang River as it flows west to the bay.",
    "The gibbets for which the bridge is named are barely visible just beyond its northern end.  Heavy timbers that make up the bridge stretch out over the Cairnfang River as it flows west to the bay, but end in jagged splinters halfway across, preventing passage across to the southern side."
