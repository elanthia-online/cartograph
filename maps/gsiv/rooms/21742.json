    "Within this serene courtyard, a variety of young trees and flowering bushes thrive along the flagstone path leading from the archway to the main building.  A small grove of cherry trees provides a shady retreat near some polished wooden benches placed along a grassy bank leading down to a small bubbling spring.  Nestled within the shade of the fruit trees sits a small cherrywood beehive.  A polished cherry dart board inlaid with a rising phoenix hangs from a willow tree."
