  "description": [
    "An oak tree divides the animal trail running along the perimeter of the wall into two narrow paths that circle its trunk then merge once more on the other side.  A thick carpet of leaves and a sprinkling of acorns cover the ground beneath its branches.  Young saplings sprout near the edge of the path, but are nearly unnoticeable amongst the underbrush."
