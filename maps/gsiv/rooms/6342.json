    "Sand-colored walls, lined half-way up with woven rattan matting, are illuminated by diffuse rays of moonlight that saturate the room through frosted glass windows etched with the alchemical symbol for earth.  Crafted of unfired clay pottery, wall sconces cradle pillar candles whose flickering flames glitter off tiny bits of quartz inlaid in the umber ceramic tile flooring.  The musical tinkling of a wind chime can be heard from high above the brushed steel workbench as gentle breezes trickle in from the piazza.",
