    "The lazily flowing Opalsand river is just visible beyond the tiny cabins that dot this street.  Dragonflies dart along the water's surface, skimming along the stream with rapid beats of their long gossamer wings.  A quaint bridge crosses the small stream just to the south, the structure just wide enough for one or two people at a time."
