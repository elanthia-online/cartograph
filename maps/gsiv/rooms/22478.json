    "Large cushioned benches are scattered about the secluded, yet spacious workroom.  A thick carpet of rich furs cover the modwir tiles beneath them, the different hues and thicknesses patch together creating a mosaic of color.  Bright crimson, gold, and ivory silk adorns the support beams before draping to the floor in elegant pools."
