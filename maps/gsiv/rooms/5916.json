    "In the center of the room sits a huge boulder.  Tattered and torn clothing rests among some white ashes and sticks, which protrude from beneath the rock.  Closer inspection reveals them to be a skeleton, which is turning to dust.  In the far corner and missing several rungs, an old rickety ladder leans against the wall.  Only the portion that is eye-level is visible as the rest of it ascends upwards into total darkness."
