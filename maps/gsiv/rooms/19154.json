    "This room seems to be the least cluttered area in this part of the ship.  One could even go so far as to say it was neat.  A few crates stacked carefully against the wall appear fairly new and in good condition, aside from the scorch marks that removed their identifying marks.  Along the ceiling, a series of steel hooks holds various toolkits and sundry items, while a set of plank shelves line the wall behind a cloth-covered counter."
