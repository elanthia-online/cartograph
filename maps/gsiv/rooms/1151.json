  "description": [
    "The river adjacent to the trail on the eastern side rages angrily as it winds through the woods and out of the mountain ranges to the north.  The river has carved its way through the soil, leaving large rocks stranded in the water and bluffs on either side of the gully.  The trail hugs the river to the northeast and shifts inland around a large, dense copse of trees to the south."
