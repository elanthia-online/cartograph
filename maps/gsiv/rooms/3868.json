    "Brightly painted cobblestones in red, blue, gold, and green transition into a sandy path to the north.  Jutting out into the pathway here and there, razor grass lines the path interspersed with stems of torch ginger, their blooms a brilliant red.  Obviously well traveled, the sandy part of the path is well packed into an almost rock-like surface.",

Jutting out into the pathway here and there, razor grass lines the path interspersed with stems of torch ginger, their blooms a brilliant red.  Obviously well traveled, the sandy part of the path to the north is well packed into an almost rock-like surface."
