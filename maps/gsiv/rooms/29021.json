    "Perched at the fork in the road, a rough wooden sign painted with arrows and thick blocky letters provides directions to various locales.  Rows of trees and neatly hewn stumps dimple the northwestern edge, while a sturdy wooden railing follows the opposite side.  Burlap sacks encircle the roots of small, new growth trees that are prepared for planting."
