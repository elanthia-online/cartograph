    "Powdered herbs, beakers, bottles and other paraphernalia lie scattered among potted chrysanthemums, violas, pansies, and carnations on long tables.  The dirt floor is littered with plant cuttings and fertilizer, and it is difficult to tell if this room is used more for preparing potions or for growing plants.  Several long, thick strips of glass allow sunlight through the ceiling, and unlit torches hang near hot iron pipes in each corner.  The scent of pollen mixed with manure fills the humid air.",
