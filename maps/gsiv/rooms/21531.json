  "description": [
    "The turf around this little food stand has been worn down to dirt from heavy foot traffic.  A makeshift counter has been formed by using a plank of polished oak supported by stacked crates on both ends.  A red wagon is pulled up behind the stand, providing a safe place for the proprietor to stay."
