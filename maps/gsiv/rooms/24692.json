    "Bright patches of moss cling to the outer rim of a huge hollowed log that dominates the center of the woodland clearing.  The fragments of a family of rabbits, most half-eaten, can be spotted just within the entry of the fallen tree, indicating a predator left in a hurry, or will be back soon."
