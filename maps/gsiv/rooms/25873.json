    "Framed by rich velvet pumpkin-hued curtains, a pair of leaded pane windows dominate the far wall of this cozy setting.  Several tall wingback chairs are centered around a long low table in front of a pale grey granite hearth with a dark stone mantle.  Ornate teak moldings add a subtle elegance to the otherwise simple furnishings."
