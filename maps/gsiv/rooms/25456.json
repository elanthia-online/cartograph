    "Wide wooden planks stained with muddy footprints stretch across the wagon floor.  Heavy taupe fabric drapes over high-arching, wooden bows, creating the illusion of spaciousness in the wagon.  Rows of velvet covered shelves displaying a collection of wares line the wagon sides.  A woven tapestry hangs over an opening leading deeper into the wagon's interior.  An iron-banded wooden cask sits beside a sturdy table near the door."
