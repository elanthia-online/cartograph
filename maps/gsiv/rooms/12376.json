    "Light filters in through delicate leaded glass windows to sparkle upon an immense white granite altar bedecked with bridal roses. The scent of roses lingers softly in the air, wrapping around you and bringing a pleasant smile to your face.   Many a happy couple has stood and pledged their troth before this simple shrine, and a feeling of joy seems to linger in the air.",
