    "This old, wooden structure is barely still standing.  Moonlight shines down through the roof in beams that highlight floating motes of dust.  In the quiet, a faint 'cooing' can be heard, revealing the presence of doves roosting in the rafters above.  Derelict horse stalls along the back wall march east, down the length of the building.",
