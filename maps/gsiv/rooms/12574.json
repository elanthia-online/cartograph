    "Sunlight filters in throught the gates, glittering off a wide staircase that leads upward, spiraling round and round beneath the enormous, glass dome ceiling.  The room is quite spacious, and though sparsely decorated, exudes a sense of elegance and respect.",
    "The moonlight adds an ethereal glow to the torchlight in the room.  A wide staircase leads upward, spiraling round and round beneath the enormous, glass dome ceiling.  Even at night, the sparsely decorated room exudes a sense of elegance and respect.  A seemingly endless blue-black sky glitters with the hundreds of white starstones that dangle from the ceiling far overhead."
