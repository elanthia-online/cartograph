    "Crescent-shaped and sandwiched between two plateau headlands, this black sand beach sits slightly protected from strong winds and rough tides.  Waves are forced to merge as they enter the shallow bay and then spread outward in calm ripples normally, though high tides and extreme weather can make this a dangerous entrapment.  Several feet from the curving wall of basalt blocks jutting sharply, staked irons holding brightly burning torches run the crest of the berm.",
