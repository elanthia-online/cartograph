    "The trail, coming from the southwest, suddenly ends at a sheer dropoff, perhaps caused decades before by raging floodwaters or a sudden settling of the land.  Massive tree roots extend out from the cliff face, then curl back to reenter the soil, keeping the entire face from tumbling down into the murky darkness below.  A huge boulder shores up part of the cliff, and the choking growth prevents movement along the edge for more than a few yards in either direction."
