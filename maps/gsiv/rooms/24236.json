  "description": [
    "This stretch of the lake spans from the cavern shore to a large block of limestone floating atop the water's surface.  Though it appears murky and dark, the lake's water is strangely silky, like a mixture of oil and satin that moves of its own accord against your skin.  Small bubbles float up from the depths, creating a burbling sound that disturbs the otherwise placid.  Opposite where the water swirls down into a churning river, the lake streches out into darkness."
