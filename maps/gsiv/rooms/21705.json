  "description": [
    "Crumbling and unstable, the southern portion of the wall that once surrounded the ShadowGuard falls away before you.  Thirty feet below, jagged stones that were once part of the wall jut upward at haphazard angles.  Loose rocks on the decaying flagstones make for hazardous footing on this precarious ledge."
