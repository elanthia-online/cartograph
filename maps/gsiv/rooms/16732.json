    "Wind, strong enough to tug at clothing, whistles as it gusts through the deep ravine.  Apart from the small ledge upon which you perch, the stone wall offers little purchase to all but the hardiest plants.  A thick hemp rope leading upward disappears over the ledge above, while a thin hemp rope leading downward stretches towards the ravine floor.  Not far below, birds of prey float serenely on the rising winds, framed against the further depths of the gorge and the flowing river at its bottom."
