    "[A Dimly-Lit Alcove]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "An array of fluted silver candelabras lines the dark oak walls of this semi-circular room, casting a diffuse yellow glow over the area.  Glass ornaments of various size and color hang from the arched fel ceiling against a sea of stark black silk, their idle spinning refracting the flickering candle light across the walls in random patterns.  Richly colored silk pillows fill the alcove's corners and sides, nearly obscuring its hardwood floor completely.  At the rear, a claw-footed mahogany table draped with crimson silk stands guard over a silk-lined haon display case visible below."
