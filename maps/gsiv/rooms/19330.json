    "A huge, diamond-paned leaded glass bay window provides the room with a spectacular view of the gardens outside.  Sunny and airy by day, at night the pale light of the moon and stars flickers magically over the black-veined, grey marble floor and walls.  Rainbows of light dance over a collection of black velvet chairs encircling an ebony table, before striking the diamond-dusted obsidian fireplace in a dazzling display.  Against the far wall sits a small credenza, over which hovers a softly glowing orb."
