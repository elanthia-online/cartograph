    "The broad sweep of the mahogany floor is interrupted by a carved ebonwood dinghy.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the mahogany paneled walls.  A hammered copper hanging rack and a gilded maple cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
