  "description": [
    "The shrill squeaks of bats flying throughout the interior of the tree assault your ears.  Sweeping and diving in the gloomy light, they call to each other in exaggerated twitters.  Several large openings to the surrounding forest permit entry and exit from the tree but the sheer sides of the trunk restrict any mode of travel other than flight.  The steep stairs circle down to the southwest in a graceful curve, while to the northwest the passageway continues its climb farther up the tree."
