  "description": [
    "Far beneath the roots of the Temple, you stand in a place of judgment and change.  Two statues face each other across the chamber.  One, made of pale alabaster, gleams in the dim light.  The other, carved of diorite, soaks up all light and is barely visible.  A bell tolls somewhere unseen, deep and sonorous, as the heartbeat of its mother must sound to the babe yet unborn in the safety of the womb.  There is a sadness to the sound that instills in you an intense sense of loss and foreboding."
