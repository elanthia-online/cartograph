    "Sheets of canvas are strung up on both sides of a wooden gate to provide privacy.  Painted on the canvas are a variety of brightly colored fish.  The sounds of splashing and laughter bubble out from behind the canvas.  A large sign is affixed to the canvas beside the gate.  An old crone is perched on a stool beside the sign."
