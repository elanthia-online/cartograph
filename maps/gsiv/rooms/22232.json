    "Enclosed by honey gold oak walls, the shop features a well-pruned lemon tree in the center of its gold oak floor.  A colorful Icemule map hangs under the stucco ceiling.  Right near the front is a heavy wooden desk and a narrow glass-topped table.",
    "A mounted fish skeleton hangs on one of the painted black oak walls, and an oak beam ceiling rises overhead.  A well-pruned lemon tree sits in one corner of a honey gold oak floor.  There is a low wrought iron table on one side of the shop and a heavy wooden desk on the other."
