    "A low granite boulder stands in the middle of the path near the top of the hill, and its surface is covered with the blackened lines of old carvings.  Further up the hill to the south, a black obelisk thrusts up against the sky beside the bulk of a great circular tower.  The worn track spirals steeply downhill to the northeast and disappears behind a shadowy cliff face.",
