    "Towering above the surroundings and set into an arched niche is a well-polished white marble statue of an elf in flowing robes, a pair of sweeping ivory-hued staircases circling around her.  Twin banners flutter to the left and right of the statue -- the one upon the right bearing the crest of House Illistim and the other bearing the insignia of the Wizard Guild.  Warm amber light flows from the landing at the top of the stairs, playing across the flawless balcony in shimmering waves."
