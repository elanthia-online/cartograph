    "A steep slope ends at the edge of a raised path of stone slabs.  Each slab is irregularly shaped, yet fits perfectly into its neighboring tiles, and the surfaces are smooth and level.   This was obviously constructed, since the rock composing it is both a different type and color from the adjacent walls.   The color, a light pinkish red, is a luminous contrast to the gloom and grey stone surrounding it."
