  "description": [
    "Along a narrow stretch of water leading out into the swamp, dark water swirls around, lapping at the extended, gargantuan roots of an enormous ancient banyan tree.  A dim, incandescent light emanates from somewhere below the surface, lending a strange glow to the liquid.  Overhead, tiny shapes flit from one bald cypress branch to another, their forms largely obscured by the webbed veil of moss that hangs heavily from the spindly branches."
