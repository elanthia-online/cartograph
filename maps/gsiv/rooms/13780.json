    "The broad sweep of the limestone floor is interrupted by a dusky blue cotton rug.  Halfway to the white stucco ceiling, a fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the tightly-woven beige canvas walls.  Some hammered copper display hooks and a Vornavian silk-covered table are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
