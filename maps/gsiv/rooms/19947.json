    "Smooth white marble flooring stretches across this room, uninterrupted save for a large, gear-shaped silver inlay in the center of the room.  Matching gears in silver, gold, bronze, and steel adorn the walls, each one polished to a mirrored sheen.   A black sign in the corner, directly between the adjacent hallways, bears an explanation of the room.  Framed portraits hang between the varying gears, while a gold marble arch leads out."
