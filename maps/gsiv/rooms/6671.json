    "The spacious chamber is dominated by a huge four-poster bed of dark maoral, its posts carved artfully into images of horrific monsters and demons.  The heavy, blood-red curtains that cover the walls make it impossible to tell if there are any windows, and the only illumination is the flickering light from a few black vaalin sconces."
