    "Large bundles of ribbon-tied triticum wheat flank the entrance to this small shop, dimly lit by evergreen-scented candles whose wicks crackle and pop as they burn.  Few decorations adorn the bare walls save a small hollowed-out niche, and a cloth-draped table that displays a variety of armor is positioned diagonally in the corner."
