  "description": [
    "The room is paneled with exotic woods, and the floors are covered with plush-woven carpets.  Potted palms occupy cozy corners, and an overhead lantern illuminates one well-done painting.  Several gaming tables, covered with green felt, are bathed with overhead stained glass lamps, and dealers and croupiers are at the ready.  Against the far wall is a polished willow wood dart board, and a brass spittoon rests under a palm.  Oddly enough, a spotted pink thrak resides in a suspended cage near the dart board."
