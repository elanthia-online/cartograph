    "Designed to resemble a natural cave rather than a building's interior, this room is both forbidding and welcoming.  Above a tile floor, the curved walls and ceilings are studded with shards of crystalline ice, which threaten to rip and tear at skin and cloth.  Yet several small peat fires fill the room with soft light and a rich, earthy smell.  A black marble arch leads through the south wall into the temple's nave.",

Above a tile floor, the curved walls and ceilings are studded with shards of crystalline ice, which threaten to rip and tear at skin and cloth.  Yet beams of sunlight penetrating deep inside the glacier fracture as they pass through these natural prisms, bathing the grotto in bands of warm, richly colorful light.  A black marble arch leads through the south wall into the temple's nave."
