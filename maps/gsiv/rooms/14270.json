    "A plethora of varied sconces decorate the dingy white walls, occupied by tall colorful tapers.  A noxious odor of bergamot and orange blossom waft from a pair of oversized braziers on either side of a large glaes and fel case.  Between the curtain to the east and the display to the west, a broad red wool runner covers the creaking fel floor."
