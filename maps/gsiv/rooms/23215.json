    "Hundreds of books on any imaginable topic are stored in this vast library.  Overstuffed chairs and a warm fire invite visitors to rest here with a good book, while a large polished haon table gives more studious visitors a spacious area for their research.  Vast windows allow moonlight into the room, while providing a breathtaking view of the snowy landscape."
