  "description": [
    "The top of the stronghold is no more than a crumbling crenallation, a shadow of its former glory.  Overlooking the Feywrot Mire, the view isn't as spectacular as it could be, given the overgrowth of the swamp blocking much of the scenery.  Several dog-faced gargoyles are perched on the turret, as if they were mounted to protect the stronghold."
