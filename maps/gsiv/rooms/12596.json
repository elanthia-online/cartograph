  "description": [
    "While the rampaging wind and fecund moss prevent a close inspection, the cliff rock seems to be of a hardness approaching glaes.  The wildly vacillating shape of the tunnel itself suggests that it might once have been a series of bubbles trapped when the earth vomited up this island long ago.  If so, the wind and sea have long since broken through the rock between the bubbles, carving them into a single passageway."
