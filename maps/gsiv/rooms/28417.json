    "A midnight blue high-pile rug covers the majority of the floor in this diminutive room, and above the heavy iron sconces, the walls are sooted black in wavering patterns as if the flames of the candles burn ceaselessly.  In the fartherest corner, a few stray feathers are scattered, along with curled metal and wooden shavings."
