  "description": [
    "The lane circles into a sharp turn at the gate of a peculiar dwelling.  It is built in cantilevered sections, which skirt the hillside in flagstone wings.  A brook bursts from its underground course and cascades over a ridge of large natural rock beside one of the residence's balconies.  The home appears to float in space above the waterfall, intimately related to the hillside which gives it a foundation."
