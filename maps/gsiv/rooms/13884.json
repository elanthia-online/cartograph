    "'The Clinch' is a busy intersection, garnering its name from an elaborately carved set of steps giving access to the north.  Rock benches offer ease to pedestrians wishing to spend idle moments contemplating either Rubblestone Pool to the south, or the rampaging River Ne'Halin coursing its subterranean canal to the northeast."
