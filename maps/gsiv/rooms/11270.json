    "Several dozen large koi swim aimlessly about in one of the tanks, occasionally stopping to search the sandy bottom for anything edible.  Their white bodies with patchworks of gold, red, black, orange and yellow must have made some of them extremely valuable to their owners.  The other tank is filled with a variety of greenery and scattered about the bottom are clams and other freshwater shellfish."
