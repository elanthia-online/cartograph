    "The ledge you are on narrows rapidly as it rejoins the side of the hill making it impossible to travel around to the north side.  An opening leads into the peak of the hill and winds its way downward into the darkness.  The wind suddenly picks up stinging your face with an icy chill and causing your eyes to water.  It is a cold reminder that makes you want to head for shelter."
