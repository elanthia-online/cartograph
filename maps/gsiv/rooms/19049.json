  "description": [
    "The tall mizzenmast's sails are furled, and a couple of halflings are busy in the rigging, checking for wear.  From the mast, a spanker boom traverses the poopdeck's promenade and juts out over the stern rail.  The spanker boom is secured over the beautiful ship's wheel, a masterpiece of polished wood.  Chatter can be heard from the saloon skylight, located just aft of the coach house."
