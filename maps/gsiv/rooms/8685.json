    "Standing in the center of the room upon a finely polished wood floor is a table carved in the shape of a crescent moon.  A thick white cloth that is embroidered with tarts and berries done in shimmering forest green thread covers the uniquely shaped top.  Scattered throughout the anteroom are low-backed vine-carved chairs that feature masterful ivy scrollwork.  A domed skylight above allows the sunlight to fill the room.",
