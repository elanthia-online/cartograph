    "Nailed haphazardly to a wall at the end of this narrow room is an old cork dartboard.  Sitting on a wide shelf that runs along one of the wooden walls, a small lamp gives off just enough light to illimuminate the numbers written in bold script on the cork board.  The shelf provides a secondary service, as it is just wide enough to allow a mug of beer to sit on it without chance of spillage.  A colorful silk curtain leads back to the dance hall."
