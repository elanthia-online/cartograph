    "Guild Master Baire's office gleams from floor to ceiling as the result of an obviously good cleaning.  Not a speck of dust resides anywhere on the crimson carpet, and the walnut paneling has been buffed to a soft sheen.  Free-standing sconces in each corner illuminate the office well, casting their glow upon the walnut desk, chairs, and several spacious bookcases.  A few potted plants lend a refreshing bit of greenery to the surroundings."
