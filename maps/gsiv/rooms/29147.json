    "Gizmos and gadgets stick out of the southern wall, each attached to a long tube that stabs the knotty pine ceiling.  A large metal cabinet rests beneath the contraption, its square base resting amid gauges in the floor that stretch to the west.  Nestled into the northern wall, a polished oak door etched with a first mate's badge and a polished oak door etched with a captain's hat rest beneath the warm glow of lanterns anchored to their lintels."
