    "Bare of color or design, the blank grey walls are a sharp contrast to the gaudily painted dome.  The vivid hues on the ceiling compete for attention in an intricate spiral, each whorl detailed with smaller swirls of riotous color in a seemingly endless progression.  Long narrow mats on the floor invite not kneeling, but lying down, the better to contemplate the vibrant patterns above.  Simple white candles provide steady illumination."
