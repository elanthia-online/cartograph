    "Buckets filled with ice sit alongside a row of large, copper, soaking tubs brimming with steaming hot water, with thick, woven reed mats laid out in front of each.  On the opposite wall, quilted sleeping pallets made up with soft, brushed wool blankets are separated by canvas screens.  A censer is seated atop a low counter stocked beneath with fresh linens and other supplies."
