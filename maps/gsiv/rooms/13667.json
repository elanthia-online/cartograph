    "An intricate knot-worked wall-hanging hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls, and a high arched ceiling rises overhead.  A wyvern painted ivory vase sits in one corner of a parquet golden oak floor.  There is a gold-veined black marble counter on one side of the shop and a large cherrywood cabinet on the other."
