    "[Outpost, Withered Cabin]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Cradled in the branches of the oak, this small cabin was crafted to fit within the natural contours of the tree.  Sheets of wood panel the walls and floor, but the roof has collapsed inward, littering the floor with piles of debris and leaves.  Sagging inward, the outer walls have been pierced by withered branches, and dark stains, perhaps from leaking sap, run down their surfaces.  Much of the room is blanketed in dust, but a small stove with a cracked vent pipe sits near an open trapdoor in the floor."
