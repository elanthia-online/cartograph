  "description": [
    "Evidence of frequent travel along the cobblestone road manifests itself all around.  Twin grooves in its surface cut the road into three distinct parts, each roughly equal to the other.  Passersby talk with each other in hushed yet excited tones, as they wander toward and away from the city of Ta'Illistim."
