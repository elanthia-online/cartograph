    "Dark drakes twist along the panels of the door where the path abruptly ends.  Power vibrates through the area, a tingling and tangy taste in the air.  Soft glows brush against the door, reflected from the votive candles lining the path to the north.  Each blade of grass, each crumble of soil, has been placed solely to draw the eye to the door blocking the path."
