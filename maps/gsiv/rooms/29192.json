    "Sounds of footsteps mingle with the calls of vendors from the wooden pier directly overhead.  Though the headspace is not abundant, the relative dryness of the sand and rocks makes the ground in this area relatively easy to traverse.  Tracks crisscrossing beneath the pier hint at the bounty that awaits a patient hunter."
