    "The trees open into a clearing bound on one side by a fallen log.  The tree trunk's wood is rotted in parts, and coated with thick moss and snow elsewhere.  It points away from the thick stands of pines, as if gesturing to the south where the ground disappears, dropping into a sheer cliff of granite that shelters a pool nestled at its feet."
