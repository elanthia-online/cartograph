    "High overhead, a white canvas ceiling is supported by thick steel poles adjacent to shorter poles that hold up the lower canvas walls divided into side-by-side dyeing stalls.  Several feet of open space remain between the ceiling and the top of the walls, allowing both light and air to suffuse the area.  Sheer white drapes separate each stall from the main of the courtyard.  Nestled in the center of the blue tiled courtyard, a small fountain burbles quietly."
