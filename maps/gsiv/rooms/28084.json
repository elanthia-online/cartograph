  "description": [
    "Merrily decorated with miniature woodworked cutouts of knight, castle, sword, and shield models coated in garishly shimmering paint, the small space is crowded but also bright and lively.  Small wooden pens and roofless barns sized at a height more appropriate to viewing for children than adults are spread over the ground, each populated with lifeless mechanical toy equines, though a handful gallop around, neighing plaintively and occasionally running into the sides of the pen, barn, and one another."
