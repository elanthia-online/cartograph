    "Numerous long oak tables line this large open hall, neatly lined in two rows along the breadth of the room.  A fair number of soldiers can be seen, most sitting and enjoying a hearty meal, while a few stand as they quickly eat a small snack.  At the very north end of the room are a number of large buffets, hosting a variety of foods for any appetite."
