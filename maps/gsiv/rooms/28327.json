    "The lopsided shack appears to have been crafted out of broken down crates and torn wool, its form threatening to topple with even the gentlest of winds.  Resting within a splayed pile of straw is a small basket of wares nestled against a metal can with an open slit, the display being mindfully watched by a large greyish cat."
