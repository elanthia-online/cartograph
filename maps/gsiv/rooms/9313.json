    "The interior of this cave is larger than it appears to be from the outside.  Someone has built a firepit on one side and from the smell, it seems firewood is not what is normally used as fuel.  A trickle near the back has been dammed up to form a small pool, just big enough to water an animal or provide a quick bath."
