    "The crown of the rock formation is strangely flat, worn smooth by wind-driven grit.  Remnants of a campfire near the center suggest that the plane has been used as a place of safety, and recently, at that.  Just before the sheer edge drops off onto the swirling desert below, there is an incised copper disk incised into the stone."
