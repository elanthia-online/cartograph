  "description": [
    "Stretching from east to west, a dark blue rug decorated with white whorls rests upon the golden linden flooring of the very wide hallway.  Oversized armchairs are scattered in a loose circle amid plush sofas, their focal point an ornate modwir podium inlaid with strips of silver.  Hurricane lanterns burn brightly from their wall mounts, the warm glow providing a cheeriness to the windowless space."
