  "description": [
    "Stretching across the entire inner width of the enormous oak tree, this office is a haven of chaos and confusion.  Papers, an open book and partially unrolled scrolls cover the surface of a massive desk that is built into the wall of the room, spilling off the desk to the floor.  Lying crumpled, a double wedding ring quilt trails half underneath the desk, tangled with a pair of fuzzy, long-eared bunny slippers."
