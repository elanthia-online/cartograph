    "The dense forest opens into a small clearing, growing thick around the perimeter to leave only a narrow path to the west.  The thick undergrowth of the forest meets tall grass which thins to bare earth at the center of the clearing, where a ring of partially buried stones protects the charred remains of a fire.  A low haunting sound fills the air as the wind sweeps over the trees and into the glade."
