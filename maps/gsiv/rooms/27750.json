    "At their northwest corner, the city walls are thick with ice.  A high tower rises to the west, its pennant flags declaring the city's proud defiance of its enemies, including the incessant frigid winds.  To the south is the rundown quadrant known as Magical Burrow, while the view to the north is completely dominated by the glacier."
