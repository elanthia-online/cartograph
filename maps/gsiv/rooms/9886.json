    "The path traverses a grove of tall linden trees, their trunks straight and elegant and their lowest branches beginning a good ways off the forest floor.  Beneath the leafy canopy, the ceiling hangs significantly higher than that of the surrounding forest, giving the glade the lofty majesty of a temple nave.  Across the glade's floor, the trail meanders in a loopy pattern that circles trees, crisscrosses and turns back on itself like a drunken serpent."
