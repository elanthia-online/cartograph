    "Solid timbers butt up against solid granite walls in this long, relatively narrow tunnel.  Standing only a foot apart, the timbers are a good foot thick and ten feet long.  They rise from the scuffed granite floor to the impenetrable rock ceiling overhead, supporting cross timbers equally as long and thick.  To hear them creak and groan, one would think that only these pieces of wood keep the weight of the entire mountain range from crushing everything in the tunnel."
