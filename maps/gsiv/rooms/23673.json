    "Stepping down three stone steps, the jungle closes in, creating a garden walled in by verdant greenery growing about carved wooden columns.  A latticework of blossoming vines crisscrosses between, creating a fragrant ceiling for the walkway.  Moonlight streams through, patterning the ground below and illuminating a garden path leading deeper into the complex."
