    "Shafts of moonlight seep through the windows, snaking through the miniscule spaces found between stacks of merchandise that fill the room.  Narrow shadowy walkways allow for navigation among the clutter and no specific organization is present in the chaos of the decor.  Shelves are interspersed in the mess, dotting the walls and peeking out from the haphazardly stacked towers of items."
