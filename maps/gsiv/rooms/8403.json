    "The stillness of the passage is broken by an occasional rumbling and a low buzz, the origin of which cannot be determined.  A fine dust covers the walls, almost obscuring the glyphs carved into them.  Rivulets of water gather in the ridged clay tracks along the floor, pooling in tiny puddles whose surfaces shimmer slightly when far-off tremors occur."
