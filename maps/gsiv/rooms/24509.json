    "The great room of the lodge is illuminated by many cheerful sconces set in the riverstone walls.  The floor is a checkerboard of blue and white opalescent tiles that contrast with the exposed beams in the ceiling.  Covering the wall opposite the entrance is a mosaic of a scarlet owl flying through the night.  A short iron potbelly stove and plush couches are arranged before the mosaic, while a solid oak banquet table with glowbark trim is set conveniently near a kitchen door.",
