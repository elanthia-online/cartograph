    "Swirls of lavender incense rise from bejeweled censers set against the soothing pale blue walls.  A row of softly padded cots stand before a glaesine-accented counter featuring all manner of salves, potions, and tinctures.  Clad in pure white robes, several attendants bustle about the chamber."
