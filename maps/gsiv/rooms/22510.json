    "Thick canvas walls fitted over a wooden frame create this quickly constructed space designed mostly to display handcrafted wares.  The open flap lets in both light and air, as well as the fetid odor of the swamp outside.  Hooks suspended from the thin rafters display a variety of pipes and bundles of dried tobacco.  A curtain draped partly across the back wall divides this boxy structure hastily assembled atop a floating wooden platform."
