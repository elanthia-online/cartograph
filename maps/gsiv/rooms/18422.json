    "Although somewhat dusty, the shop is otherwise tidily kept, its interior lit with simple lanterns that hang from several beams in the ceiling.  A single wide row of wooden racks stretches across the center of the floor, its upright fixtures holding up baskets filled with various flowers.  On the far wall, just behind a long counter, a sliding panel is affixed in the open position.  Windows placed high up on the walls allow a glimpse of the starlit sky outside.",

Windows placed high up on the walls allow sunlight to stream into the shop to bathe the wares in a pale golden glow."
