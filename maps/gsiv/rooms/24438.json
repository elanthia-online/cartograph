    "Colorful, glass-paned lanterns strung overhead illuminate the natural stone walls and painted cobblestones.  Wooden tables surrounded by mismatched chairs take up most of the space, except for a large stove and supply bin in one corner with a pair of high-backed rocking chairs arranged in front.  Water trickles down the far wall, pooling into a shallow, carved basin."
