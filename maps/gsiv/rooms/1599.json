    "Moonlight softly illuminates the crowded flowerbeds forming the northern border of the avenue.  Saffron snapdragon compete with bright yellow daffodils and golden sunflowers, forming a wall of living color and greenery.  A pair of golden sandstone pegasi kneel to either side of a brick walkway that leads north beyond the flowerbeds.  Tall boxwood hedges line the south side of the esplanade, parted by a broad tiled path leading south.",
