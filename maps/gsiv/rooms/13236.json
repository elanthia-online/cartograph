    "You are standing at a massive and well-polished desk made of ancient modwir.  A sheet of clear glass covers part of it and tucked neatly underneath is an elegantly penned scroll.  Standing behind the desk is the concierge, a cheerful and well-dressed man.  Hanging on the wall behind him you see a small key rack."
