    "Skirting the fringes of the bog, you come upon the cause of its existence.  A small creek has been blocked off by fallen trees to create a turbid lake behind a natural dam.  The water seeps over the banks to flood the graveyard here, with damp earth and brackish puddles forming a bog that surrounds broken and overturned tombstones.  Small trails where the earth is more solid crisscross the fetid swamp."
