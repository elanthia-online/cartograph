    "Several well-groomed trees stand here and there, while a plush carpet of grass rests beneath them.  The cobblestone road weaves a course between the trees so that the main traffic can continue on through.  A wooden swing hangs from one of the large trees, providing a place for children to play or one to sit and dream.",
