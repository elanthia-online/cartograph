    "This detailed replica of a roomy box stall is complete with a hay rack, tack box, and a metal watering trough.  A hanging display of hook picks has been tacked against one wall, while a selection of mane and tail combs have been splayed across some empty feedbags in the corner.  Additional wares can be seen on display through a crosshatched half-door in the back."
