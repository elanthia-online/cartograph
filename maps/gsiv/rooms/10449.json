  "description": [
    "A small rise to this area gives an unobstructed view of the surrounding grass-covered sward.  The great inner walls of the inner keep can be seen to the north, along with the well-guarded gate leading inside.  To the east and south, the outer keep walls appear as dark green hedge, caused by the copious amount of vines that infest its ramparts.",
    "A small rise to the area gives an unobstructed view of the surrounding grass-covered sward.  The great inner walls of the inner keep can be seen illuminated by rows of brightly lit torches to the north.  To the east and south, the outer keep walls appear as a large black obstacle in the night."
