    "Deep jungle opens into a large clearing, the dimness of the rainforest easing into the soft luminescence of moonlight.  Distinctly different from the forest surrounding it, the clearing offers a wide open space free of most trees and foliage.  Hard-packed dirt is softened by small patches of sun-bleached grasses and mosses.  Tiny lizards speed across the clearing, using rock piles and fallen branches as cover."
