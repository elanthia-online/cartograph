    "Thick curtains of amethyst velvet are draped from ebonwood partitions, creating the ceiling and walls of this pavilion.  Electrum sconces are bolted to the wooden supports, softly illuminating dozens of lengths of fabric suspended from above.  A small parchment sign is propped up on an electrum-gilded ebonwood table that sits at the center of the room."
