  "description": [
    "Several coats of arms hang from the dark modwir walls in this softly lit room.  The south wall displays captured banners and armaments from a variety of military campaigns.  A large fieldstone fireplace dominates the north wall.  A massive oaken table sits surrounded by a horde of oak chairs in the center of the room beneath a black wrought iron chandelier.  Despite the presence of war paraphernalia, a sense of peace pervades the room."
