    "[A Twist of Roses, Antechamber]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "White marble floors and walls veined with pale pinks create an immaculate antechamber of stark simplicity, and three jewel-inset arches provide the only break in the walls.  Centered with precision, an ebon marble rose caught in full bloom is inlaid into the floor, its thorny green marble stem pointing towards the exit."
