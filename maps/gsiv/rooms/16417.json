    "A sprawl of tiny, dimly lit stalls and larger, more ornate stone shops abut one another, crowding both sides of the street.  A few determined birch trees dot the bazaar, bringing a touch of green and silver to the almost uniformly bluish-grey stone scheme.  One particularly tenacious tree has grown to a staggering height, its top towering over the rooflines.",
