    "The staircase leads onto a smooth pathway that has been excavated from the side of the hill.  A thin layer of snow covers the ground along the path but stops short of an opening hidden behind a drift of snow.  The entrance leads north into a tunnel that was not formed naturally.  As you get closer to the opening, a waft of warm air against your face reminds you how cold you are."
