    "The canvas walls of this small pavilion are hung with carefully tied bundles of hair in a variety of colors.  A vat of lye sits next to the pinned-back tent flap, but even that extra ventilation isn't enough to keep the harsh vapors from stinging your eyes.  Casually stacked on a low counter are bowls of henna paste, vinegar, sodden ashes, and dark ink."
