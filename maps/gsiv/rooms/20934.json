    "At this end of the sandbar, all views of the surrounding sea remain concealed beneath the persistent island mist.  Rock material abounds, jutting dangerously out of the ground in many places.  A series of irregular stones, each double the size of a human fist, form an oval around a shallow depression in the dark sand."
