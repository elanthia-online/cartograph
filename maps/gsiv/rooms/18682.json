    "Lacquered golden bamboo walls stand out from the polished white birch floor and bind the swathes of soft orange linens that decorate the high ceiling.  Centered beneath a gold-wrapped frosted glass orb is a long bamboo weapon's rack framed by porcelain white vases filled with young bamboo shoots and painted with a swirl of yellow butterflies.  Wide cushions are arranged around a low table, which is set beneath a framed parchment painting.",
