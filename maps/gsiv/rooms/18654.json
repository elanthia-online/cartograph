    "The ice that makes the walls of this room has been sculpted by a master's hand.  Into the frozen surface niches have been formed, and from the bottom of each nook rises a statue representing one of the members of the pantheon of Liabo.  All is carved from the single, immense sheet of ice that makes the room itself."
