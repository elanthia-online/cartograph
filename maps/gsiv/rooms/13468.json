    "Clustered around the edge of a bluff stands a number of dwellings constructed of huge logs and sheltered by the low-hanging boughs of towering pine trees.  Stones provide the substance of chimneys, porches and walks, the granite and fieldstone displaying an enviable pattern of striations.  Small bunches of flowers bloom in the moonlight within pockets of topsoil here and there.  However, the rocky terrain has been stingy with growing space.",
