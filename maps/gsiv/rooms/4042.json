    "Stained-glass windows glow like jewels, reflecting the light of the many pure white candles that flicker around the simple altar where couples kneel to exchange their wedding vows.  Hand-sewn tapestries depict scenes from married life in rich, colorful detail along the walls.  Fresh flowers are brought in each day, and their soft, romantic fragrance fills the small chapel."
