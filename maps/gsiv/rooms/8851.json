  "description": [
    "A dog yelps from someone's back yard, keeping up his barking until a half-dozen neighborhood mutts join in the chorus.  A stone bench circles a small tree in the center of the cul-de-sac, providing a shady place to chat amid the cobblestones and dust.  The mouthwatering aroma of roasting meat wafts from a nearby window."
