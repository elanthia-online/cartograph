    "The garden is covered in cats.  They come in all shapes, sizes and colors, making the small plot of land a sea of particolored fur.  They rub against each other or bathe in the dirt, busily lazy in the warm sun.  The plants have certainly seen better days, however, as each bears a mark of some feline's tender mercies.",
