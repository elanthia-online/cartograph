  "description": [
    "Long tendrils of grey-green moss drape gracefully from the overhead branches of an ancient cedar.  An artistic touch has been rendered with the twisting of red silk ribbons into the tendrils, like a grey-haired matriarch with beribboned braids.  Beneath the living curtain, chiseled-stone statues stand sentinel at the corners of a raised wooden platform."
