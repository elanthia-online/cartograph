    "Herbs and ingredients are scattered haphazardly around this small garden.  Bottles lean precariously against one another in one corner.  Several wooden tables of simple construction compete for space with the larger herb bushes, and many plants that appear to be suspiciously non-herbal seem to have established themselves in various nooks and crannies.  A narrow brick path winds through the area.  Several torches stand sentinel around the area, waiting to be put to use when night falls.",
