    "Atop some battered stairs, you find the blackened remains of the master bedroom.  Scorched and looted of its past grandeur, all that remains is a carved window seat, covered with scraps of burnt grey velvet.  Gazing past the broken glass window frame, you look down upon the twisted ruins of a small garden."
