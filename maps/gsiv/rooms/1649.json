    "A narrow grassy trail passes between the swift creek to the south and the steep rock face to the north.  A pair of small thanot shrubs flank the first of a series of flat riverstones which cross the creek.  The sound of the swiftly flowing water is echoed by the rock face so that you are surrounded by the chuckling of the creek."
