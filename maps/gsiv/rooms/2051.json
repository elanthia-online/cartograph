    "A high bank climbs out of black pools choked with mud, dank water and clinging water plants.  Roots clamber down the incline, knotted with tendrils, broad leaves and runners.  Moonlight reflects off of the swampy water illuminating drifting patches of fog, which aids the darkness in hiding pitfalls and other hazards.  The air is heavy, carrying the odors of decay and growth like a mantle.",
