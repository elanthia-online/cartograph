    "The chamber appears to be circular.  However, a stand of life-sized stone trees obscures the walls, rendering that determination uncertain.  Forming an ageless glade, the carven boles of the trees are lifelike, down to detailed bark and leaves.  Icicles drip from the rock leaves, and in the center of the frozen grove stands an altar."
