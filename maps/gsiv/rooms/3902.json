    "The firm soil of the path to the northeast quickly turns to mud and pools of stagnant water to the southwest.  As progress becomes more difficult, a raised walkway made of wooden planks elevates travelers above the treacherous, sliding mud.  The falls to the northeast, known as Kaskara Zahar, or the Cascade Taehhar, pour from the Cairnfang River above, and the delta of the mighty Cairnfang rushes into Solhaven Bay to the south."
