    "Tiny houses dot the small incline to the southeast where dormitory style housing is built along the flat plane of a grassy knoll.  Crisscrossing crushed shell pathways form dizzying patterns amid the untamed blades until they converge into a solid path that spills into the cobblestone road.  Glaesine-doored lanterns line the northwestern edge, their sunlit-faces spilling rainbows across a sprawling stucco academy."
