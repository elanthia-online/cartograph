  "description": [
    "A soft, warm glow fills the room, generated by floating orbs of light that seem to recede from you no matter which direction you approach from.  Comfortable furniture and tomes of magic fill every nook and cranny, and it becomes obvious the glowing orbs were created for the sheer pleasure of reading.  The most striking impression, however, is the ceiling.  It appears as a breathtaking surreal vista of the night sky, with magnificent comets and brilliant stars seeming to pulsate down at you."
