  "description": [
    "A small black cat dozes off to one side, half obscured by a large brass planter containing a young sapling.  Evidently conserving his energy until the evening hunt, the feline's tail occasionally twitches in his sleep as the light from a narrow window falls across his upturned stomach.  A heavy canvas drapery hangs in a doorway to the south, allowing some measure of solitude to those beyond.",
    "An elegantly molded brass planter sits to one side of the hallway, the young elm sapling within surrounded by its own shed leaves.  A heavy canvas drapery hangs in a doorway to the south, opposite a narrow window that looks out into a moonlit garden."
