    "The steps are steep and they twist up the cliff's face in a lazy S-curve like the trail of a snake climbing a desert dune.  Along the cliff-side of the flight, knobs have been carved in the form of sand devil heads that support a rudimentary handrail crafted of teak.  The rail passes through the sand devils' bared teeth, leaving one to worry that the monsters will at some point grow tired of their burden and spit the rail out."
