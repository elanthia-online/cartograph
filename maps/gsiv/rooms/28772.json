  "description": [
    "A magnificent elk head watches over the spacious anteroom, black glass eyes tirelessly overseeing the comings and goings of guests.  A small black iron furnace sits to one side of a double-doored entrance, standing guard against the cold sneaking in through the open entry, but the promise of greater warmth roars from the east carried by the pops and crackling of a blaze that can be heard even over the din of nearby conversation.  Overhead, a chandelier made from interwoven antlers holds several dozen candles aloft."
