    "Framed in oak, a pair of windows flank the entry and allow the bright glow of the day to slant across the smooth tiles of the floor.  Sturdy racks, crafted of various woods dyed a warm golden hue, are neatly arranged throughout the shop and display the various wares sold here.  A thin counter, its sides wrapped in off-white skirts, stretches across the back wall."
