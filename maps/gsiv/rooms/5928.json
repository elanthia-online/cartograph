    "To the west, the cavern narrows considerably as some of the walls have crumbled towards the middle of the passageway.  A clammy breeze stirs some dust into a whirlwind as it passes through the narrow openings in the crumbled stones.  A small river of water winds through the piles of refuse that litter the ground."
