    "A few oak cases display some of the jeweler's selection of finished pieces, while more sit on racks atop the cases.  A blue, green, and purple rug sits to one side of the room, a couple of chairs with a small table between them resting upon it.  Across from the chairs is a large mirror allowing patrons to admire their new purchases on themselves."
