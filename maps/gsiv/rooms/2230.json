    "Violent volcanic upheaval has left a chamber within the black heart of the mountainside.  The shadowy cavern is deep but narrow, and its walls are pocked with crevices and veined with minerals caught in the glaes long ago.  A few beams of light have found their way down into the gloom from a jagged fissure above.  They create a stark spotlight on the rough stone floor.",
