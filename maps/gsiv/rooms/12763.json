    "A man-height wide at its narrowest point, hairline fractures form a lacework of cracks in the time-worn basalt, marking this arch as the oldest intact formation in the valley.  They also seem a sure sign that it will not remain so much longer.  Below, the main lava channel is alight with molten rock that has found its way down from the lava fountains along the southern ridge.  From here you can go down the span to the northern side of the channel, or down the southern end of the arch to that bank."
