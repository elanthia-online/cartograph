    "Everything inside this foliage-lined hut has been constructed on a smaller than normal scale.  A child-sized, painted wooden chair rests beside a multicolored table.  Above them, a vine-draped wire birdcage is filled with whimsical carvings.  A lacquered mahogany branch, suspended by silver wires, provides a precarious roost for a family of painted wooden sprites."
