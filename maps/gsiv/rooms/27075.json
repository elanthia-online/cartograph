  "description": [
    "Creepers and vines wage war for dominance within the thick foliage of the bog oak forest, their spindled limbs laden with thorn and leaves.  Shade and shelter keep the moonlight at bay, but hinder movement through area.  Small patches of grass manage to hold ground here and there, though large toadstools play court within their blades.  Colorful motes of light flutter through the air."
