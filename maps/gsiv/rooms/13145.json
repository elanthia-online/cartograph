    "Dominating the view to the north is a substantial opening in the tunnel leading to large cavern.  Niches have been carved into the rocky walls, tall enough to house a giantman, and each indentation holds a luminescent toadstool.  The combined luminescence of the fungi brighten every corner and crevice, banishing all shadows from the vicinity."
