    "Poorly tanned pelts hang from the walls, the stains beneath them looking suspiciously like blood.  Dominating one wall is a large bear head, still dripping occasionally onto the bronze-tipped spear below.  The owner of the room must be highly esteemed in the orcish society, although his badges of power do very little to inspire anything but nausea in you."
