  "description": [
    "Fed from a source deep within the stone, water sluices along the channel, joined from the grate above by the drip, drip, plop of indeterminate fluids that smell distinctly of rot.  Though the curved floor of the tunnel is slick, it's large enough to crawl toward a faint light that distantly filters in."
