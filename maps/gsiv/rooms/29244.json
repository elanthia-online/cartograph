  "description": [
    "Small furrows run perpendicularly across the clearing, hinting at past attempts to cultivate the land.  Waist-high native grasses, their seed heads full and draping, cover much of the ground.  Interspersed with the grasses, colorful wildflowers with their red, orange, and purple petals announce their distain for the notion of regimented agriculture."
