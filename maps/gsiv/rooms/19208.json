    "A steady stream of piratical-looking halflings march through this area of the bakery, purchasing packets of spinach tarts.  Their presence awes the visiting children, who clutch their parents' hands while goggling at the ship's natives.  An oak plank table bearing a large steel tray and cups of hot herbal tea separates the pirates from the youthful landlubbers."
