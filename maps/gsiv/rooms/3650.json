    "The silvery moonlight pours down, catching upon the tiny flecks of mica in the cobblestones and creating tiny pinpoints of sparkling light.  Quaint shops line the street, each decorated in a unique and cozy fashion.  Short, squat bushes, bearing tiny white flowers, accent the front of one shop, their gentle fragrance adrift on the cool night breeze.",
    "The cool grey hue of the cobblestone path is warm from the bright sunlight pouring down.  Quaint shops line the street, each decorated in a unique and cozy fashion.  Short, squat bushes, bearing tiny white flowers, accent the front of one shop, their gentle fragrance adrift on the breeze."
