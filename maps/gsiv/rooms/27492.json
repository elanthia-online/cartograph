    "Swathes of striped linen partition the interior into several sections grouped by wares.  While the shop is slightly cramped, there is still adequate space to navigate between inventory displays and reach other areas of the tent.  Some straw-stuffed crates have been stacked beside an open iron-bound chest on one side of the path, while a yellow cloth-covered table stands opposite them."
