  "description": [
    "The forest floor is carpeted with several layers of leaves, the remnants of decades of autumns, and the perfect fodder for the thick undergrowth of greenery that fills every space not occupied by a massive tree.  Through this dominating wood, the trail cuts its way north and south, resisting nature's takeover."
