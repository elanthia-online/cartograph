  "description": [
    "Long blades of grass rise from between the oak planks of the walkway that leads back to the midway, their edges thick with seeds.  Low clusters of brambles create a knotted fence around the perimeter of the clearing, while dangling vines weave through the canopy above.  Several large boulders are arranged according to size beneath the watchful gaze of a beribboned oak post."
