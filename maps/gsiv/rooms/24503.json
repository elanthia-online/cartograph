    "Light floods into the airy space through a wall of glass, through which can be seen the large waterfall that feeds Lake Eonak.  In the center of the room is a long, polished white marble counter, inset with a deep double-sided sink.  High above, globes are inset in the ceiling, and a series of leather padded bar stools are lined up against the counter.  Gleaming copper pots and pans hang along the back wall above an elegant mithril stove, and an open doorway leads back to the entry.  The entire western wall is also glass, complete with a floor-to-ceiling sliding glass door leading onto the deck."
