    "A single lantern fitted with panes of crimson glass hangs directly above the Dragon's Bones table, bathing its surroundings in a lurid red glow.  A prominately placed warning and disclaimer have been nailed to the wall directly opposite to a similarly hung payoff chart and large poster.  Above a heavy jade curtain is the head of a huge dragon made entirely of gleaming brass."
