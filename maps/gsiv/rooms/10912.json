  "description": [
    "A polished bamboo desk surrounded by comfortable wicker chairs sits in the middle of this modestly sized office.  Behind the desk hangs a large, yellowed map of River's Rest and the surrounding areas.  A pleasant-looking, bespectacled young man sits behind the desk with an eager smile.  Near the desk stands a tall chest containing drawers labelled \"maps\" and \"deeds\" as well as drawers devoted to letters of the alphabet."
