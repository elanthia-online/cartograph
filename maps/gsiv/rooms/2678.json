    "Clouds merge with blowing snow and an uncertain horizon.  Courageous patches of light randomly filter through the wind, sparkling off the frozen path and then fraying back into the haze as if devoured.  The way curves to the northwest around a wall of stone, encrusted with ice that almost obscures its carved surface.  To the northeast, a trail, little more than packed ice, snakes across a narrow ledge which is almost obscured by a dense shower of blowing snow.",
