    "Thick, elongated tufts of bearded grass blanket the floor and tiny granular particles from them float serenely through the air.  Flickering shadows dance across enormous mottled eggs that are resting in a nest of dead grass and leaves.  The bottom of the nest is littered with strange looking triangular seeds that seem ready to burst open and spray their contents over the eggs at any given moment.",
    "Enormous mottled eggs from an unknown creature are resting in a nest of dead grass and leaves at the base of a dead tupelo tree.  The bottom of the nest is littered with strange looking triangular seeds that seem ready to burst open and spray their contents over the eggs at any given moment.  Thick, elongated tufts of bearded grass blanket the floor and tiny granular particles from them float serenely through the air."
