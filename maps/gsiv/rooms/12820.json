    "Warm diffused light peek through long slotted windows set between plush tapestries embroidered with the seal of the Baron of Vornavis surrounded by emblems of the Guild Houses.  A grand podium wrought of solid fel wood and ornately carved with pictorials of Koar predominate the center of the room flanked by guardsmen who stand at attention while court is in session."
