    "The sounds of merriment and revelry fill the establishment, where a small number of stools line up before a long papaya wood bar carved with elaborate palm frond designs.  A faded driftwood sign hangs next to a bronzed palm frond shelf behind the bar, where a portly rosy-cheeked bar keeper provides service to potential patrons."
