  "description": [
    "Splintered wood ceiling beams, broken up by several large plant roots, threaten to cave in at any moment bringing down the crumbling ruins.  Small bugs crawl and slither in and around the plant tendrils, drawn by the moisture running along the root appendages.  The smell of mildew is very much present, likely from the decay created by insects feasting on the vegetation."
