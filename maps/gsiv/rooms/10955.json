    "There is a strong funk of recently disturbed dust and pungent smoke in the still air of the small tent.  A small, smoky oil lamp provides a dim yellowish light.  In the back of the tent a remarkably homely giantman snoozes while leaning against a pair of sturdy-looking strongboxes.  The hornswoggler sits cross-legged on a bamboo mat, smoking tobacco from a hookah."
