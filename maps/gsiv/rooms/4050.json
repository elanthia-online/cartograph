    "All sorts of accessories in the way of belts, headwear, and fashionable jewelry can be found on this side of the shop.",
    "Silk-leafed strands of vivid ivy form a frame along the ivory walls, the fabric forming haphazard lattices across the room.  Accessories and bits of jewelry lay draped upon an ivy-painted box and a velvet-padded shelf, adding additional color to the otherwise neutral-toned area."
