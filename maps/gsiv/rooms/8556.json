    "A small wooden bridge provides dry passage over a picturesque crystal clear stream that is bursting with life.  Small schools of silvery fish dart back and forth in the water and tiny green frogs sun themselves on the half-submerged rocks.  Meandering towards the north is a dirt path with scores of wildflowers growing up on either side.",
