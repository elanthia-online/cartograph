  "description": [
    "From this narrow precipice, tiny figures holding torches and lanterns can be glimpsed on the black sand beach below whenever the fog, mist, and pungent steam billow off in a brief, but welcome breeze.  A colony of black coral clings to the base of a rocky overhang.  The tiny lights on the beach, however, pale in comparison to those that can be seen overhead when the fog lifts, exposing the grandeur of the vast, inky black sky.",

A colony of black coral clings to the base of a rocky overhang.  The sound of waves lapping at the shoreline is punctuated now and then by high-pitched calls of sea birds from above and excited shouts from the beachfront below."
