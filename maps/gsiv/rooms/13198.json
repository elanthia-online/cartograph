    "Thick cobalt blue rugs line the tidy room from wall to wall, and muffle all sound.  Portraits, covered in heavy drapes, occupy the thick limestone walls, while various chests and coffers are set sporadically about the room.  A narrow accounting desk is set to one side with a tall oak stool tucked beneath it, and is topped with a journal, inkpot, and quill."
