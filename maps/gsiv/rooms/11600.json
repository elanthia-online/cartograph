    "A long table, lined with benches, stands in the center of the room.  Some ratty bunks are set against the far wall.  Near the doorway is a smaller table with a chess board carved into the surface.  Stools and straight-backed chairs are scattered throughout.  A pair of dusty glowing orbs hang from the plank ceiling, casting a hazy light throughout the room."
