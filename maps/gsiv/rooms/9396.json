  "description": [
    "A scattering of arcane symbols, worked in polished brass, are inlaid in the blue granite floor.  A few of the sigils even gleam from the stair treads and risers that circle upward to the floor above.  Opposite the stairway,  a midnight blue tapestry stitched with gold astrological diagrams forms a backdrop for a glaes-paned display case and a dark maoral counter.  Cracked plaster walls peek between the wall hangings."
