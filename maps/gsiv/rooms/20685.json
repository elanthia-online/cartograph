    "Within this cramped rhimar-lined chamber, an incredible amount of ice resides.  Various shapes and sizes of the frozen stuff have been neatly stored in separate areas within an assortment of boxes and shelves.  The biting cold is intense and lingering too long in this room would be a bad idea.  A set of doors in the west wall offers escape from the chill."
