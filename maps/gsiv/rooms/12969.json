    "The path grows increasingly stony as it ascends to the west, where silvery light highlights a tumble of exposed boulders.  The slope to the south is dark with dry, thorny vines, and the narrow track winds down to the base of the hill just shy of the lowermost tendrils.  A dense fog blankets the grass and obscures much of the town below.",

A light fog hovers over the grass and spreads out across the town below."
