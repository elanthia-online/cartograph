    "The scents of oak paneling, oiled leather, and fine cigar smoke indicate that Elanthia's most discriminating gentlemen shop here.  Several hooks placed along the wall are bedecked with finery of all hues and textures.",
    "Muted panels of hunter green and russet cloth form the backdrop for the room, highlighting some antler-shaped hooks and a polished modwir dresser dominating the side wall.  The faint scent of oiled leather and cigar tobacco wafts through the room, the fragrance's origins unknown."
