    "Light streaming in through several windows illuminates dozens of bins that line three walls of this workspace.  Several dressforms have been pushed into one corner and securely lashed to the walls to prevent tipping.  Next to the entrance is a long counter piled with pattern books, measuring cords, and boxes of embellishments.  Several drawers of various sizes fill the available space below the counter.  Although the room is cramped, it is very organized and smells faintly of pine."
