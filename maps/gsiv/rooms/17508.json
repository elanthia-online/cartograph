    "Birch trees bend into a gentle arc at the tent's wide ceiling, the thin lengths wrapped with suede and rawhide to create a weather-tight seal.  The central pole supports the center of the tent, where a wide opening is positioned over a deep fire pit and allows streams of sunlight to slant across the room.  At the back, a slender tent flap leads further into the tent, while several leather saddlebags and a series of woven sea grass baskets lay in ordered chaos throughout the room."
