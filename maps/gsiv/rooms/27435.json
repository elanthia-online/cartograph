    "Most of the ground here is sticky and moist, the constant overflow of blood seeping into the dirt creating a red-tinged muddy slurry underfoot.  A line of vultite-braced cannons, connected at one end to a squat metal vat, stands several feet in front of a set of targets.  A brawny horned man stands watch to one side, his bare chest splattered with the blood mixture used in the game."
