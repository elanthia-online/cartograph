  "description": [
    "Slate and flint steps go up and down the hillside, interrupted here by a terrace slightly smaller than the one below.  Hardy creeping phlox with cheery periwinkle and pink blooms lines the edges of the light grey slate square in front of an unimposing fel cottage.  Slightly musty, earthy, and ammoniated smells coming from the cottage's door are somewhat mitigated by the large tubs of lavender in bloom sitting athwart it."
