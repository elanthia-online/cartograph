    "Rows upon rows of tomes and grimoires line shelves built into the cavernous wall itself, and rickety ladders are positioned discreetly to the side.  A variety of small reading tables are spaced evenly throughout the room, each harboring a tiny silk-shrouded oil lamp upon their lustrous black surfaces.  A small alcove lies to the east, the rippling candlelight from within only a small beacon in the sea of desklamps."
