    "A stone basin sits in the center of the castle courtyard.  Standing within it is a man, badly wounded, up to his knees in blood.  The crimson liquid pours from his cuts, trickling into the pool with a happy sound reminiscent of a burbling fountain.  He holds his hands above his head, as if bound by an invisible cord, although his face registers no emotion at all."
