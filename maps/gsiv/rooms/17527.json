  "description": [
    "Built from darkly stained planks, this treetop observatory is built between two large oaks, spanning across the grassy trail below.  The steeply pitched roof overhangs the platform to provide shelter for a round maoral door.  An old sylvan doorkeeper is perched precariously on the wooden railing.  A small brass bell is mounted besides the door, allowing visitors to announce their presence."
