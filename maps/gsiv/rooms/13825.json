    "Refined oak-paneled walls rise from a varnished dark oak floor.  Just above a worn rug hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a domed white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  Some hammered copper display hooks and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
