    "A cramped cavern opens up with a dirt floor and a slick, icy ceiling.  Patches of dirty, clumped snow that have escaped the drifts above or were knocked down the hole and through the shop's entrance have been trampled upon and muddied even further by the heavy feet of perusing shoppers, but remain frozen thanks to the freezing temperature within this concealed shop."
