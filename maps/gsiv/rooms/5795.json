  "description": [
    "The curvilinear forms of stalactites and stalagmites are a dramatic contrast to rigidly angular mine shafts.  Curtainlike rock formations as thin as parchment hang down almost to the floor, and the only sign of sentient hands is a serpentine form crudely incised on one of the larger stalagmites."
