    "It is difficult to see here, due to a thick swirling mist that blankets this room entirely.  Now and again it wavers just enough for you to see a dark stone monolith towering nearly to the ceiling.  The iron bunks and other furnishings that may have once served to accommodate the guards are carelessly tossed to one corner of the room in order to make way for this mysterious artifact."
