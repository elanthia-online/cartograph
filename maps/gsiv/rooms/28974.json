    "Basket lanterns dangle from the smooth stone ceiling to fill the room with a soft light that reflects off of the gold stitching of the anchor-patterned floor covering.  Stretched along the western wall of the small office is an enormous map of Kraken's Fall, its surrounding environs, and the stretch of the Tenebrous Cauldron.  Positioned to face the door, a small desk covered with a variety of papers, files, and quills has a small chair set behind it."
