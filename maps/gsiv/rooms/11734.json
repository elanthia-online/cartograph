    "Five torches burn in the center of the chamber to the east, below a large half-dome of concentric rings.  Above, the outer edge of the dome meets with the lower ceiling of a hallway which leads off to the west.  Pieces of rusting and damaged armor lie spread across the ground, many dented and splattered with dark stains, and accompanied by broken spear hafts and the splintered remains of arrows."
