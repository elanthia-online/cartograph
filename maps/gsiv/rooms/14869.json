    "The meadow spreading out all around is peaceful and still in the moonlight, except for an occasional breeze ruffling the tall grasses.  Dark silhouettes of distant trees rim the large field, while nearby the shadowy bulk of small boulders lurk.  Stretching out overhead in all its glory is the night sky, with a multitude of stars twinkling in the ebon vastness.",
    "The meadow spreading out all around is peaceful and still, except for an occasional bird and a breeze ruffling the tall grasses.  The dark green of distant trees rims the large field, while nearby the greys and browns of small boulders are ringed with colorful wildflowers.  Stretching out overhead in all its glory is the cerulean sky, with several fluffy white clouds sailing through its vastness."
