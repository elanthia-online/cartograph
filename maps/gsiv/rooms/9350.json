    "In front of the fire-gutted walls of a ruined building is a single well-weathered sign.  Any paint that may have once covered it is long gone, however the carving of a bunch of grapes can still be made out.  A second destroyed building that may have once been a stable sits slightly behind the first set of blackened roofless walls."
