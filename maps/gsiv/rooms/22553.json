    "Surrounded by walls of long, woven swamp grass, the tent smells about as good as it looks.  The odor of skunks and slime pervades the small area with a noxious scent.  In the center of the room, a circular oak pedestal leans slightly to one side, yet still manages to display its wares to shoppers.  Against the far wall, a makeshift wooden counter seems to have been added as an afterthought.  The two exits are merely holes that appear to have been torn in the grass walls."
