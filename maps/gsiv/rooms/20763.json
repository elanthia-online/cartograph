    "Dozens of thick beeswax candles cast a pale yellow glow across the room, creating a soothing atmosphere.  Several thick, velvet meditation mats have been placed around the room, providing a comfortable place to pray and commune with the gods.  Brackets affixed to the darkly paneled walls hold bouquets of fragrant lilies entwined with dark green strands of ivy.  A small stone and oak altar stands beneath a stained glass window that portrays the environs of Icemule in a variety of blues and greys.  A carved dark oak door leads out of the chapel."
