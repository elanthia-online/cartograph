  "description": [
    "Cloying, sweet decay overwhelms any of the cavern's other odors, from the faintly metallic odor of the water to the ever-present bitterness of mold.  Its source is a jagged-edged pit, roundly uneven, that bores down into the stone of peninsula as it reaches its culmination.  Before the gash stands a tall pedestal with an ancient skin-bound enchiridion upon it."
