    "Blood-soaked prayer mats are lined up evenly facing a section of the wall marred with claw marks.  Resting atop four tentacle-like appendages is a pink lace-accented display, its glass top shattered.  Sunken into the floor next to each prayer mat is an uninviting cot.  A tentacle-wrapped squat dilapidated bookshelf filled with stained books and other trinkets off to one side catches your eye."
