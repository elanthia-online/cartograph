    "Wide sheets of dark green canvas hung high in the trees effectively shut off the sunlight to cast this small glen into near darkness.  Candles of all shapes, sizes and colors sit on stumps, tables, benches, rocks and other supporting items.  Over half the candles burn odorlessly, their flickering flames presenting a tapestry of shining stars.  Occasionally a scented candle sputters to life, filling the glen with its unique scent before it dies out and another candle flares to take its place.",
