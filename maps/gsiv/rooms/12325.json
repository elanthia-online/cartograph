    "Floorboards of polished linden glitter with a golden glow as the sunlight reflects off of them, while dainty butterflies flit about the colorful petals of the morning glories that litter the nearby vines as they twine about the carved railings.

Saffron yellow sails slant across the space to create a bit of shelter from the island's harsher elements, their ends anchored to both the distant wall of the inn and the tree beyond."
