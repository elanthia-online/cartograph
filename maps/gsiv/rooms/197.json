    "Rambling through the sunlit garden, a grey stone path ends at the pond's edge, which is bordered with lush azalea, nympheas, multi-hued wisteria, and bamboo trees.  Soft colors line the deep blue water, as garden hues mesh on the reflective surface.  Ensconced by purple and ivory water lilies, floating lily pads blanket the edges of the pond, and tiny green frogs lightly skip from one padded perch to another.  A small dock bordered with weeping willows juts over one edge of the pond.",
    "Rambling through the garden, a grey stone path ends at the pond's edge, which is bordered with lush azalea, nympheas, multi-hued wisteria, and bamboo trees.  Moonlight reflects off of the pond's calm surface, the vibrant garden colors muted in the surrounding cover of darkness.  Echoing all around, the quiet sounds of frogs and crickets fill the air.  A small dock bordered with weeping willows juts over one edge of the pond."
