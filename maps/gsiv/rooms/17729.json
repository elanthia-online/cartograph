    "The inside of this office is in remarkable shape considering the appearance of the building surrounding it.  Rough-cut, cedar paneling covers the walls and supports several paintings depicting various marsh scenes.  Two windows, although heavily covered with grime and bugs, allow light to filter in.  A varnished cedar desk and matching chair huddle in one corner, with an unlit torch affixed to the wall just above.  The cedar floor displays heavy wear from the passage of many footsteps.",
