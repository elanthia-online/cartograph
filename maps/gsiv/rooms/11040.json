    "In this pastoral setting, a babbling creek rushes alongside the path, starlight glinting on the water in silvery glimmers of reflection.  As it turns it widens and hurries past grassy banks blooming with tiny flowers.  Large stones smoothed by eons of running water line the creek shores, signaling the long ago existence of an ancient riverbed.  The path runs northwest towards a forest, while the northeast direction moves over rolling meadowed hills.",
