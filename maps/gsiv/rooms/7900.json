  "description": [
    "The view from the arms of the statue is breathtaking as you look out across the treetops of the forest which spans for miles.  Looking upon the face of the statue, you sense a calm, giving presence and wonder just whose arms you rest in.  The winds eddy and flow around you as if attracted by the very nature of the majestic figure.  Several long vines drape across the statue's hand."
