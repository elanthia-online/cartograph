    "The floor planks of this long, wide porch creak and groan underfoot, and swinging doors leading inside squeak on their hinges.  Overhead, a wooden awning provides protection from rain.  Square, wooden pillars, part of the rail surrounding the porch, support the awning above.  Several chairs, a bench, and a suspended wooden swing are placed about the porch for watching the road.",
