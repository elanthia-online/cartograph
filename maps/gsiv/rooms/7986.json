    "More books and scrolls than you've ever seen in one place line the walls of this spacious room, the central focus of which is a massive fireplace with a mahogany mantel in which fragrant cherry wood crackles and pops.  Trophies, busts and sketches of prominent local citizens are in evidence.  Large floor cushions and comfortable armchairs invite you to relax, read or enjoy conversation at an immaculately polished table in one corner.  The gleaming mahogany bar is well-stocked with only the finest libations."
