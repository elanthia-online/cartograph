    "Sweeping silk curtains flank the long arched window to the north, casting a dim illumination onto the dark ashwood desk.  Soft plush seats are arranged in a comfortable grouping about the desk, each adorned with a variety of velvet pillows.  Piles of papers and writing implements cover the desk, nearly concealing a small silver flute."
