    "The red tiled roof of a villa is visible beyond the vine-covered wall bordering the south side of Limpet Trail.  Although the vines may make the wall easily scalable, passersby give it a wide berth and test the air with hesitant sniffs as they pass.  Apparently, the vines' pale blossoms provide some form of deterrant to any who might harbor an inclination to trespass."
