    "Simple, but elegant, the teakwood flooring of this room is polished to a lustrous sheen.  A royal blue velvet pennant edged in silver hangs near a heavy, white muslin curtain.",
    "Rattan stools flank an ebonwood-topped driftwood bar resting on a large mat of pressed banana leaves, and a wide cushioned wicker armchair invites relaxation while enjoying libation.  Bright blue woven mats are placed before a dark gold flyrsilk curtain and a pale lapis muslin-covered opening."
