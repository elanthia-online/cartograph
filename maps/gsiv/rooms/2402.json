    "A twisting staircase with slender, wrought-iron rails hangs precariously from the backside of the Nightowl Pub.  The top of the staircase ends just below an open window on the second story.  Empty barrels are stacked in the space beneath the staircase, providing a rather splintery cushion for anyone who might fall."
