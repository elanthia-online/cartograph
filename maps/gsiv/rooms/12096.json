  "description": [
    "The ground beneath you is white, strangely grainy and light.  Tunnels lead off to the northeast and southwest, winding erratically through the odd earth.  Walls made of a hard, transparent material close about you, distorting the images beyond them.  Looking carefully, it almost seems that a small human sits just beyond the glass, staring at you with great interest."
