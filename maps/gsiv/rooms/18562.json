    "At the edge of the outer fields, the artichoke plants are sparser, and it is apparent that the center fields have been cleared away with the intention of leaving it fallow for at least a short time.  The plants that do rise up resemble healthy, almost-ripe artichokes.  Standing in front of the growth, several booths and tents stand atop the recently smoothed soil."
