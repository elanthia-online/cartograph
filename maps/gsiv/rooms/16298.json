    "Bridgeunder Lane follows the perimeter of the central courtyard, its outer shoulder adorned with a row of cottages.  A dense bank of hostas lines the walk, sending up tall stalks studded with lavender flowers.  Overhead, a single majestic magnolia tree adds the perfume of its blooms to the breeze."
