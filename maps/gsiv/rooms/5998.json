    "Built against an outcropping of pale quartz, a squat mortar and stone well rests amid the meadow grasses, a jagged crack in one side allowing its fluid contents to leak across the surrounding field.  Restored by a natural spring oozing forth from the lichen-coated rock, the well sustains a continuous slow leak and a healthy growth of thick moss around its interior walls.",
