  "description": [
    "Green grass and tiny flowers in a myriad of hues line the well-worn path that leads away from town proper.  Ruts from wagon wheels bite deeply into the ground, and the grass between the trenches has turned brown from the abuse.  A wide-brimmed straw hat hangs from one of the fence posts bordering the path, a dusty blue ribbon tied into bow adorning it."
