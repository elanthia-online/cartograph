    "A series of shaped wooden frames with adjustable metal screws have been fixed at head height in front of a row of straight-backed chairs.  They all face the near wall of the tent, where inspirational phrases have been painted in bright, cheery colors.  A few of the protruding screws still show traces of former users."
