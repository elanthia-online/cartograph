    "Flecks of mica glitter within the walls of black granite blocks, though shadows cover most of the area.  Only a single, small luminescent toadstool offers illumination in this slightly dank chamber.  Faintly visible, a set of stone shelves holds a variety of unmarked vials and bottles, while a large clear glaes tank flashes below."
