    "Square white sails fly high overhead along the thick mast at the center of this foredeck constructed of midnight blue oak with chrome finished hardware.  Taut white ropes secure the rigging above to chrome cleats, their loose ends laid into neat, flat spirals on the spotless deck.  Poised at the tip of the bow is a detailed figurehead depicting a young elven man with one hand outstretched towards the horizon.  Polished chrome handrails accompany a spiral staircase below."
