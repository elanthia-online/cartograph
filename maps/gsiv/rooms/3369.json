    "Benches of carved ice with seats of wood surround the central altar, bowered with beardtongue shrubs.  The glitter of the fallen snow reflects light in a myriad of rainbows, creating a hypnotic effect ideal for settling into a meditative state.  Carved into the base of the glacier is a dark crevice leading into the mountain of ice."
