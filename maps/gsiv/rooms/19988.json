    "High walls rise up to encase this open arena in a solid cover, muting the sounds of the town to a quiet muffle.  Sunlight from the open sky glints off the surface of tall flag poles, their banners stirring slightly with the breeze.  The arena itself is a circular stretch of scuffed dark slate, surrounded by a set of wide stone steps which lead up to an observation deck."
