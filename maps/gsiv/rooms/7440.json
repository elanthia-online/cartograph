    "A vast plain of large boulders and jagged rocks stretches out to the east, as far as the eye can see.  A high, sheer cliff rises up to the west, making travel in that direction impossible.  The cliff follows a line curving around from the northeast, to the south, and then curving southeast farther in the distance."
