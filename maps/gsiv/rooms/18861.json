  "description": [
    "The path angles away from the Hall for a small distance, until it opens upon a tree-lined square surrounded by quality acreage and four fieldstone longhouses, each with several unique doors.  At the center of the square, a fountain topped with a statue of a man gesturing as he casts a spell cascades into its marble pool.  A wide spiral staircase can be seen descending around the base of the fountain."
