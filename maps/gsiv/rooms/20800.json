    "Elaborately carved oaken doors open up into this small bedroom.  Most of the room is taken up by ancient tomes.  A glint of silver from a scroll amongst the tomes catches your eye.  Above a massive hearth hangs a venerable golden rolaren scabbard, the size of a claidhmore.  An adjacent alcove holds a silk-draped altar."
