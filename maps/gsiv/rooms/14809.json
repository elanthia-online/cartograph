  "description": [
    "The scent of dye and leather lingers in this spacious workshop.  Sturdy wooden worktables are arranged around the area, each paired with one of several cobbler's lasts.  The floor is pale hardwood, left uncovered for ease of sweeping up scrap materials.  A long tool rack hangs on the wall opposite the door, next to which stands a glaes-bound barrel."
