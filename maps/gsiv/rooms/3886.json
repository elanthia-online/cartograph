  "description": [
    "Footsteps echo off the smooth stone floor and barren walls of this sparsely decorated foyer.  A slender ebon pedestal stands in the center of the room, with a golden statue of the scales of justice displayed atop it.  A pair of sleepy-looking guards stand to either side of the thick iron gate leading west into the depths of the prison and an arched doorway leading directly east."
