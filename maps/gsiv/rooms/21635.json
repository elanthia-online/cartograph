    "Rust-pitted nails and dried mud hold the decrepit wooden plank walls of this shack precariously together.  A constant buzzing of wings resonates throughout the small shack, and light filters through cracks, gaps, and knotholes in the planks, revealing the source of the noise to be a large wasp nest on the shack's roof.  The interior of the shack is unadorned except for a huge wooden door left to rot on the trampled grass floor."
