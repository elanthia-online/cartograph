    "Beyond the wooden platform, the flat fields of the Grasslands extend in all directions.  The wooden palisade walls of Wehnimer's Landing rise up to the northeast, and the high peaks of Melgorehn's Reach cast a long shadow across a nearby lake.  Armored Chastonian soldiers and blue-robed mages patrol around the wooden platform."
