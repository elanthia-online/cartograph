    "A row of curved windows positioned along the far sandstone wall delivers a breathtaking view of the deep silver, brown, and black of the desert's landscape in the distance.  Far beyond the inner walls of the sanctum, the shadow of a sandstorm churns violently on the horizon.  Dried trails of blood lead to a large copper-barred door, where a dampened sound savagely rattles from within."
