    "Whitewashed walls wrap the tiny room and are interrupted by enormous windows framed by thick shutters that can be opened to allow the cool island breezes to pass through.  Cabinets and cupboards housing various sundries are positioned between the windows, while a low counter stands before a double-wide arch."
