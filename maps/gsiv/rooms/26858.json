    "Enclosed by a tall wrought iron fence covered in frost, this small circular space is peaceful and quiet.  Bright winter roses in dozens of different hues are scattered around the perimeter of the circle, the plants crawling up the fence and surrounding the space in winding green vines and splashes of vibrant color.  A long modwir bench is placed in the center of the cobblestone circle, facing the entrance to the shrine."
