    "A thick vine hangs from a tall tree nearby, its circumference larger than a giantman's arm.  Roots from the trees appear to have grown around the vine, entangling it forever in their tight grasp.  Closer inspection reveals a trail of ants traveling down the length of the vine into an intricate anthill they have built near the base of the tree."
