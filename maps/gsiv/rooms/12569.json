    "The crease of a small valley marks the last dip before the rise of the volcano.  Mist filters down through the branches above and pools between various jagged rocks that have tumbled together at the lowest point of the defile.  Large, sloppy nests crown many of the rocks, but the inhabitants are nowhere to be seen."
