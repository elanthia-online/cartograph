  "description": [
    "Neat rows of flowerbeds are arranged in uniform lines north and south of the cobblestone walkway in alternating rows of begonias, hydrangea, and aromatic lavender.  A phalanx of ancient willow trees stands sentinel along the path, each with an ornately carved wooden bench shaded beneath it.  Several smaller paths branch from the main walkway to allow further exploration of the garden."
