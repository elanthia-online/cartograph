    "A mordant odor descends from the smoking chimney of a sturdy little building on the east side of the court.  From the deeply recessed windows, it appears that the walls of the building have been constructed out of a double layer of heavy granite blocks, though for what purpose you cannot imagine.  A tarnished brass sign is set into the iron-banded thanot doors leading into the establishment.",
    "The chimney of a sturdy building on the east side of the court belches a mordant plume of smoke, tinging the air above it an acrid green.  Judging from the deeply recessed windows and the inset door, the silvery blue walls of the building appear to be constructed out of a double layer of heavy granite blocks.  A tarnished brass sign is set into the iron-banded blue thanot doors leading into the establishment."
