  "description": [
    "As if housing a massive floral endeavor, the broad field of green to one side is filled with gigantic buds.  The artichokes are not quite ready to burst into maturity, but the petals that wrap up around the heart seem to be slightly loose, indicating the impending bloom of the plant.  Opposite the field, a bunch of wildflowers grow up alongside the dusty path, their colorful blossoms and growth throwing a subtly sweet scent into the air."
