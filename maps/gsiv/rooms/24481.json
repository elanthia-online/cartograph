    "The hallway leading into this open room is covered with hanging maps of the environs of Elanthia.  Notes are pinned to them in various places indicating where changes need to be made in the new maps.  Throughout the ceiling, clear tubes of glass carry the sun's rays from further above down through the soil to this room.  On a large circular table in the center of the room, parchments, pens and ink await the next student."
