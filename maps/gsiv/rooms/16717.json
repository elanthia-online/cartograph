    "The canopy overhead thickens, leaving the faint trail leading north nearly impossible to find.  To the southeast, it is more visible until it curves out of sight behind a stand of great moss-covered trees.  To the east stands a stone pillar, upon which rests a granite tablet, clear of the otherwise ever present growth of the woods."
