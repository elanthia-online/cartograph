    "Belying the gentle face elsewhere shown, this is most obviously the Armory of the manor.  Neatly racked weapons and rows of polished armor and well-groomed leather trappings show a House that is not all play and dissipation.  A stout table stands in the center of the room ready to hold gear and other such other preparations as may be called for."
