    "The icy wind blasts over the flat, frozen ground, picking up whatever things it can find--snow, ice, dust, pebbles--and flinging them against anything that stands in its way.  The constant windy assault has rounded the edges of the boulders that stand in the area.  Their windward faces are smooth and curvaceous, while the leeward sides are sharp and well defined.  It is not surprising that the leeward side of these boulders is where small animal burrows can be found."
