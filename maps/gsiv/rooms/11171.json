    "On the north wall is an intricate design depicting a proud warrior in gleaming armor.  He sits astride a heavily armored war-horse, wielding a large menacing blade on a field of battle.  His foes litter the ground about him.  The design has been splashed with paint, which disfigures the image, but does not detract from its dignity."
