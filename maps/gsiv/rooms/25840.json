    "Rows of verdant hedges extend along the back wall of the manor, while vibrant flowerbeds create a border along a spruced walkway that winds through the garden.  A stretch of pebblestone creates a circle in the heart of the garden where a dozen stones and rocks have been placed about.  An unseen bird makes its presence known with the occasional quiet chirp."
