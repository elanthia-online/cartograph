    "Whirling snow is tinted an incongruous rose color by the low arctic light.  Then, a lull in the wind offers a breathtaking vision!  Mantled by the storm's flurry, a monument perches on the mountain's top, immense in size and of extraordinary beauty.  Columns march across the facade, their tops almost lost in the clouds, framing a colossal door.  Beside the door, a shining gold crown is mounted in bas-relief, erratically throwing out brilliant reflections as light fights through the fog to caress it.",
