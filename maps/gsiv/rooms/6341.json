    "Walls of pale ice blue, painted with silver snowflakes, are illuminated by diffuse rays of moonlight that saturate the room through frosted glass windows etched with the alchemical symbols for water and cold.  Crafted of walrus tusk, wall sconces cradle pillar candles whose flickering flames glitter off cut crystal tile flooring that resembles blocks of ice.  The musical tinkling of a wind chime can be heard from high above the brushed steel workbench as gentle breezes trickle in from the piazza.",
