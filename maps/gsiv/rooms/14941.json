    "Standing alone in the center of this peaceful meadow is a gigantic oak tree.  Wildflowers have grown haphazardly throughout the grass creating an array of colors that spreads across the entire meadow.  Off in the distance a small group of tawny deer can be seen grazing, with an enormous buck keeping watch."
