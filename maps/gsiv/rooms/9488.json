  "description": [
    "A long corridor-like room widens out at the south end, much like the bell on a horn.  A bed is placed against the wall at the wide end, and twin toadstools in large stone pots flank the bed to brightly light it.  Light golden carpet covers the floor, and the walls and ceiling are painted a similar color.  Given the bed's positioning and the room's length, one could easily take a running start and jump onto the bed, but the management might frown on that."
