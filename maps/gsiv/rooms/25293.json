    "The scent of freshly baked tarts wafts through the air of this enormous kitchen.  Along the back, cabinets have been stuffed to the brim with cooking utensils and ingredients.  A small group of students hovers around a large oven in the corner, pestering a jovial cook.  A long countertop lines the opposite wall, a few newly made dishes resting on its surface."
