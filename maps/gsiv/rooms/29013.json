  "description": [
    "Pendulum lamps with jewel-toned stained glass shades hang above the bar, illuminating the cherry wood and highlighting clusters of drink accoutrements, such as embossed coasters, napkins, and extra garnishes.  Swags of wine-hued velvet drape the ceiling and upper walls, subduing sound as well as the light from the candelabra scattered about.  The effect is close and intimate, with a pair of suede-covered couches and several upholstered chairs arranged around a modest fireplace with a stone hearth."
