    "Shrubbery and other overgrowth blend the faint trail with the murk that lingers over the ground like a haze.  Sunlight sifts through the canopy enshrouding the area, a few thin shafts of light falling upon a large secluded stone.  The northern portion of the path splits off into a fork as it follows the bog edge around the meadowland, where a solitary tree can be seen towering into the sky.",
