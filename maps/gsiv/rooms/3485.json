    "A large inn marks the bustling corner of the court, its massive walls enlivened by deeply carved intertwining vines that creep up the stonework and meet in a mass of heavy stone foliage above each window embrasure and door lintel.  An engraved silver sign swings from a post beside the inn's ironwood front doors.",
