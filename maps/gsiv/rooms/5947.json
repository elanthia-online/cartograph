    "The low uneven ceiling with jagged protrusions makes walking upright burdensome.  An almost new helmet sits on its base in the corner of the room.  Closer inspection shows a decapitated head with glossed over eyes raised to the ceiling seeing nothing.  In a small nook of the chamber the remaining dismembered body parts of the corpse rest silently.  Small armies of rodents scamper, with high-pitched squeals, back into a hole in the ground."
