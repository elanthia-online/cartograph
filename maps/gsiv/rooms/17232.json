    "A leather chair sits behind the desk centered in the room.  On the other side of the desk are three more chairs.  Portraits hang on the wall, depicting battles both grand and small.  One of the pictures isn't a battle scene however, it looks to be a rendering of the grove prior to the guild's construction."
