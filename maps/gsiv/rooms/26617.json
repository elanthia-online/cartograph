    "Thin cracks beneath the rocky surface hiss and vibrate, releasing plumes of steam that surround a large sconce-flanked hole, the heavy haze making proper breathing difficult.  The layered walls of rock have been inscribed with illegible drawings, the dark sanguine ink bleeding down into a puddle of moistened dirt."
