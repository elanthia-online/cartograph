  "description": [
    "An embankment of granite swallows the trail abruptly, its demise marked by a small circular patch of ground covered with loose shale and stones.  Past the embankment, the ground drops away into shadowy depths, leaving only clouds and blowing snow visible from the path.  The wind is cruelly edged, blowing up from the dark gorge with a fury.   A rickety sign stands crookedly beside the gravel turn, with rough letters inscribed that proclaim the warning, 'Beware'."
