    "A small clearing opens up at the bank of the river.  Several old, rotting logs line the muddy banks of the Locksmehr River.  A long, narrow island sits in the center of the water, sheltered from the swift movement of the current.  A hefty amount of cracked and faded wood is stacked neatly off to the side of the trail.  A tight rope has been strung above the river to serve as a way to cross the raging current to the small island."
