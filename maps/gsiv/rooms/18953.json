  "description": [
    "Condensation drips from the ceiling and runs down the ironwood walls to disappear into a wide drain grate in the far corner, leaving the floor slick with moisture.  A spacious brass tub has been set into the ironwood plank floor, and hot water swirls and foams within.  A metal vat is securely bolted against the wall with a pipe and a chain hanging down just above the tub."
