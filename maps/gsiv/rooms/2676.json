    "The stairs curve up toward the east, dark with shadow and treacherous with ice.  Along the outside wall, friezes follow the ascent, providing a rich panorama of dense detail that adds to the menace of the ice, adding the temptation of studying the carved stone instead of the ice-covered steps."
