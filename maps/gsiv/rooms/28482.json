    "Racks of weapons and armor are arrayed in tight formation in this ample, square room.  The light from several polished invar lanterns gleams brightly on the sharp edges of the forest of blades.  An elderly dwarf hums softly to himself as he moves among the smithwork, polishing each piece with a soft cloth."
