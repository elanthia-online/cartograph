    "Two round oak tables dominate the center of the room, with wooden chairs and stools encircling each one.  Tin plates and utensils occupy a few spots along the tables, and uniformed militiamen move freely about, their chatter creating an interminable din of voices in the area.  Young orphan children dutifully carry bowls and cups back and forth between the hall and the kitchen just to the west, where the palpable scent of roasted boar originates from."
