    "Maps cover the walls of this cluttered office, some the detailed work of expert cartographers and others crude sketches with barely identifiable markings.  A slate-topped table occupies the center of the room, illuminated by a single translucent glaes panel skylight.  Scattered on shelves and boxes around the room's perimeter are numerous weapons, bits of armor, and artifacts, each tagged or neatly labeled with its location of origin and a date."
