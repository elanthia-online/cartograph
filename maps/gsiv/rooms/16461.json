    "This wood panel-lined office is small, but well-kept and cozy, and several leather-covered chairs invite customers to rest while waiting.  Dusty, but well-groomed young men hurry in and out of the office, taking whispered orders from the leather-clad sylvan woman who shuffles through paperwork at the counter, glancing up with her bright green eyes."
