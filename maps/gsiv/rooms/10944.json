    "The spice-laden odor of pickle brine pervades the small, quiet shop.  Pale beams of moonlight filter through a pair of small windows.  Ceramic oil lamps hanging from the beamed ceiling illuminate three large pickle barrels and a pair of stubby, wooden tubs.  An oak-topped counter holds a few tall jars and ceramic jugs.  A sign hangs on the wall above the counter.  Moonlit greenery can be seen through an archway leading to the east.",
