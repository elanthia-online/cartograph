    "Far below, a crystalline stream burbles over its rocky bed, the vivid blue of the water cutting through the verdant green of the thick, tropical plants.  A refreshing updraft sweeps along the face of the cliff, bringing with it the scent of rich earth.  Swinging slightly with the breeze, a sturdy plank and rope bridge offers passage across the chasm to the northwest."
