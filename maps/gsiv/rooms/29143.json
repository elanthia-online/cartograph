  "description": [
    "Heavy cabinets fashioned of steel encircle the short corridor, their steel faces reflecting the ambient light that filters from nearby lanterns.  A long counter, also fashioned of steel, stretches across the space acting as a barrier between the shop and storage area.  Crates, casks, bundles, and footlockers, each with bright white labels, are stacked in tidy rows beyond the counter."
