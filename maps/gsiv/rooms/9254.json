    "Leaning severely to one side, the multicolored tent standing here appears to have been set up by someone who never set one up before.  Stitched together from odd-sized pieces of red, black, green, blue, and white silk, it's a small wonder that the thing actually stands erect.  A low log building sits close to the stockade wall just to the north, and further south stands the eastern-most of a string of merchant wagons."
