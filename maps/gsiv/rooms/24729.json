    "At the furthest edge of the village, a small field spreads out in an almost spherical shape.  The field is primarily matted dirt with patches of brownish-yellow grass sprouting here and there.  Some crude wooden pens sit empty in a row behind a weathered old outhouse.  Beyond the stretch of the field, a great wall of trees rises up as ancient oak sentinels."
