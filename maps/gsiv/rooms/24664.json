    "Long and echoing, the ruin corridor features a few torches brightly lit and sending up smoky wisps that stain the walls alongside each sconce.  The acrid smell of rancid oil hotly fills the stretch of this egress and does little to mask the additional odors of mildew and decay, as well as fresh turned earth evident by the small mounded piles lining the way."
