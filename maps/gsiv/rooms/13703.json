  "description": [
    "A linen-draped window is situated upon the eastern grey stone wall, its simply-designed curtains billowing gently with every faint draft of wind from outside.  A large iron candelabra stands in the center of the room, its dark candles casting waves of fiery scarlet light across the lustrous maoral beam ceiling and the maoral plank floor.  A long carved fel counter stands along the northern wall, a bronze-chased fel rack affixed above it."
