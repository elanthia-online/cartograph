    "Multiple lengths of newly planed boards have been laid diagonally across sturdy pilings buried in the waist-deep muck.  Rounded teak pegs affix each board in place, forming a sturdy walkway for egress through the darkest part of the swamp.  Colorful lanterns cast a silvery grey light across the foliage-choked miasma, where a large pair of golden eyes seem to follow every movement on the walkway."
