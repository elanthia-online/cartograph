    "The broken, decayed form of a large palm frond serves as an architectural twist of nature as it forms a lean-to for the inhabitants of the jungle.  Leftovers from the leaf-cutter ants that make their meal of the vegetation, several piles of fallen leaves are scattered about the ground.  Clusters of wildflowers make their home beneath the shadows of the frond, their coloring muted in the darkness of night.  Shafts of moonlight hazily illuminate the jungle as a light night breeze whistles through the trees."
