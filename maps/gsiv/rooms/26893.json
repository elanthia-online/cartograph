  "description": [
    "Slipping between terraces, the narrow street is littered with uneven cobblestones and copper-banded rain barrels.  Balconies, draped with an assortment of drying clothes, crowd the air above and do little to lighten the prevailing gloom.  The cloying scent of flowers wages war with that of the pervading mildew and moss."
