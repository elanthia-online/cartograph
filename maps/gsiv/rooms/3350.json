    "The curls of fog end abruptly at an abandoned house.  The windows are broken and rough-hewn pine boards are nailed haphazardly over them.  The door is also boarded up although it is obvious that the lock has been forced.  The house is covered in soot and broken down from where flames ate at the already decrepit structure.",
    "Curls of fog end abruptly at a freshly painted house.  The windows of thickly bubbled glass are spotlessly clean, bordered by newly hewn pine shutters.  The door also bears a new coat of paint, though it is not quite enough to disguise the gouges in the wood at the corners of the frame nearest the handle.  Despite their new paint, the foundation stones are still noticeably discolored at the base of the building, showing where flames once blackened the rock.",
