  "description": [
    "This bridge between the guardhouse and the barbican is surfaced with cobblestones, their uneven surfaces slippery with the humid fog drifting across the lake.  Little protection from a fall into the grey water is offered, since the bridge's walls are barely higher than a dwarf's knee on either side.  Castellated towers flanking the guardhouse keep silent vigil over the span, warding the approach to the castle."
