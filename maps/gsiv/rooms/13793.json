    "Knotty oak-paneled walls rise from a warped pale driftwood floor.  Just above a thick off-white carpet hangs a curl-edged vellum wall map, and a wide-planked white cedar ceiling completes the picture.  A series of low oak shelves and a painted white oak table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
