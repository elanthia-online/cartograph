    "A pile of large boulders, the remnants of a partial collapse of the canyon wall, seem to block further passage through the cleft in the mountainside.  Flecked with a few clusters of orange and pale green lichen, the boulders appear to have lain in this position for some time.  Oddly, some of the large stones have been etched with what appear to be shallow hand and footholds."
