    "Wisps of steam rise off the pool as the hot water comes in contact with the cool mountain air.  Centered in the pool is a flat rock, barely protruding above the surface.  The rock has become home to several dragonflies.  Shadows from the tree branches above dance across the water.",
    "Wisps of steam rise from the pool as the hot water comes in contact with the cool night breeze.  Moonlight illuminates a flat rock centered in the pool which has become home to several dragonflies.  The midnight-black water mirrors the night sky, seemingly an extension of the heavens above."
