    "Something with sharp claws has wounded one of the trees, ripping the protective bark from the tree's grainy flesh.  From the gashes pours thick amber sap, running down the trunk as if the tree bled.  Several insects have been trapped in the substance, sacrificing themselves as fascinating pieces of amber in the making."
