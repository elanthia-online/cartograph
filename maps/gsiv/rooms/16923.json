    "A multitude of shelves line the walls here, spanning from floor to ceiling and completely stocked with alchemic ingredients.  Glaes shards have been imbedded into the floor, creating a dazzling pattern beneath the light of a few giant luminescent toadstools.  Draped across the entrance to a short tunnel is a grey-threaded curtain."
