    "The faint scent of sea air suggests the far end of this tunnel opens somewhere along Darkstone Bay, but only someone who knew the path well would brave the branching passageways.  A subterranean waterfall conceals a dogleg turn that widens out into a natural chamber.  Within the vaulted chamber, sealed display cases hold delicate treasures, while gold and silver baubles cover the floor in glittering drifts.  A dip in the floor holds a pool of coins that would be deep enough for swimming if the pit were filled with water."
