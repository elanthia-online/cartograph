    "The Performance Hall is a grand chamber filled with rows of cushioned benches facing a stage at the far end.  The stage has generous proportions -- heavy indigo curtains flank it on either side.  A row of lanterns placed along its lip are hooded on the sides facing the audience, with all their illumination directed toward center-stage."
