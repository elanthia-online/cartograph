    "Comfortable couches, divans, and chairs sit in a comfortable pattern about the room, just the right space apart for casual conversation.  Filmy curtains billow around an open window, and the soft sound of windchimes fills the air.  A large loom sits in one corner, holding a half-finished tapestry."
