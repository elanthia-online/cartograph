    "The branches of the ancient linden tree twist about themselves, offering numerous locations throughout for comfortable seating.  Five-petaled flowers shimmer softly with a golden glow and verdant leaves gently rustle against the soft bark of the tree.  A soft, gentle hum can be heard emanating from within the core of the tree."
