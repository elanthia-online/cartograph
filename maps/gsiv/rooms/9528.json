  "description": [
    "The stench of death pools against the western wall, filling the area with the near-overpowering odor of decomposing flesh.  Small pieces of flesh still cling to many of the bones that litter the top of the bone river, putrefying and rotting away slowly in the dry conditions.  The odor of decay seems to be everywhere in the cavern, but, for some odd reason, is particularly nauseous at this juncture. Perhaps it is because the air doesn't seem to move at all here."
