    "The pale stucco ceiling is trisected by exposed maoral rafters, each carved with intricate detail.  The dark blue wool runners lead from the entrance to a richly-hued maoral desk.  A blue-grey granite fireplace is located on the south wall, opposite a large bay window.  An oval mirror graces the otherwise bare mantle.  A crimson velvet settee faces the fireplace and a pair of matching chairs are positioned carefully near the desk."
