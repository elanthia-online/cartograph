    "Poised high above the city of Ta'Vaalor, this narrow balcony offers sweeping vistas northward up the Mistydeep River.  The fortress at Ravelin is clearly visible, the standard of Ta'Vaalor whipping in the breezes from its topmost point.  At the northern horizon, a faint mistiness marks the location of the Lake of Fear.  A narrow stone staircase spirals up the side of the tower to its top."
