    "Four thick candles surround a niche in the corner of the room and offer the only source of light other than three narrow windows placed halfway up the polished granite walls.  Moonlight streaming through the narrow windows reveals that the floor is carved with a pattern of squares scored from alternating directions.  A dark wood workbench sits in the center of the room.  From outside, the calls of water fowl accompany the slow languid sounds of a great flowing river."
