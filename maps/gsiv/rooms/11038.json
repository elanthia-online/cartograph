    "The path appears deadended in this cul-de-sac ringed by tall tanik trees.  The dark trunks reach skyward, splitting into multi-tiered branches with blue-green fir needles.  Verdant moss covers the ground, playing hide and seek underneath lush fiddlehead ferns.  A lichen-covered granite outcropping in the distance to the northwest has a curtain of vines descending over what looks like a dark opening.  A path leads northeast out of the cul-de-sac."
