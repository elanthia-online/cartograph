    "A small stream parallels the cobbled path for a while, its fast-moving, happily gurgling water eventually veering off toward the southwest to join up with the larger river.  The crystal clear water allows for an unobstructed view of the river stone-lined streambed, small wisp-like algae clinging to a few of the smooth pebbles along its bottom."
