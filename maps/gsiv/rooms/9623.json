    "Conifers completely replace the deciduous forest at this altitude, and the pine needles give off a soft crunching underfoot.  Here and there bare stones push up through the needles, and the scent of pinesap is readily apparent.  The tall forest allows some starlight to filter through, although the large trunks and low, spreading branches prevent deviations of more than a few yards from the beaten path.  The ground slopes sharply upward to the southwest."
