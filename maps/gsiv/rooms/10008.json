    "A brisk, steady wind blows over the plain, swirling odd bits of grass and leaves across the ancient road and bending the rough patches of brambles and heather that dot the surrounding plain in an eternal slant.  Parallel lines of crumbled stone that once were walls stretch to the north, marking the edges of the rutted road.",
