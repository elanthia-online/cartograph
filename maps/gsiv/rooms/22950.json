  "description": [
    "Two colossal trees lie across the path and are draped in a blanket of shaggy moss that is browned and lifeless.  Enormous holes pockmark the upper arboreal body and provide a view of the rotted and hollowed interior, while the lower monstrosity is half-buried in the sucking muck that spreads across the ground.  A thick cluster of tiny black gnats hovers in the air above the twin masses, while a spider near the roots waits in the shadows."
