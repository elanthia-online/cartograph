    "Tall shoots of bamboo intermingle with the vast amount of trees surrounding the edge of the jungle.  A small stream trickles through the leaf-cluttered soil, its surface barely rippling as the humidity of the environment threatens to disperse its presence.  The occasional screech of a spider monkey amongst the canopy overhead is joined by the caws of exotic birds and the rustling of the underbrush as the inhabitants move within."
