    "The shop is devoid of any frivolous amneties.  A simple marble-topped counter dominates the room.  Assaulting the nose are the odors of a variety of meats, some cooked and some not, assaults the nose.  The smell of salt is also quite strong in the shops, obviously used in curing stores of meat."
