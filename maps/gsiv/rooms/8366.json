    "The passageway ends in an alcove, its bottom a well of dust.  The sediment creates a miniature landscape of dunes rippling across the chamber with no solid floor visible.  Shadows crouch in the corners and cower in the lee of the drifts, and the walls tower silently into the gloom's embrace, their faces covered with runes."
