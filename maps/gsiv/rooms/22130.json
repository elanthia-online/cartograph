  "description": [
    "Sunlight spills through the window of this cozy room, refracted into myriad tiny rainbows against the walls by the snowflake prisms suspended in front of the clear glaes panes.  A mahogany bed rests against the far wall, and a tall basin-topped table carved of the same dark wood is partially concealed by an ivory and rosewood folding screen.  Triangular planks of fel have been inlaid to form a starburst-patterned floor, its burnished shine reflected in the a tall oval mirror standing in one corner."
