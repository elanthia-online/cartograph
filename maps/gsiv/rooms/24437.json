    "Shelves filled with neatly labeled boxes cover the natural stone wall opposite a polished oak counter piled high with wrapped packages, a pair of oil lamps at either end.  Brightly colored ribbons are tacked to a rectangular piece of cork hung next to a glass display case crowded with delicate tea cups and tiny crystal figurines.  Underfoot, a rug of woven yarn patterned with posies covers the freshly swept dirt floor."
