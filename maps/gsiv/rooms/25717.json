    "Large windows topped in violet gauze and framed in white shutters stand open to allow the delicate fragrances of the garden beyond.  Mannequins, ranging in a broad spectrum of heights, are arranged throughout the room, their linen-covered bodies wearing the half-finished designs of the season.  A carved mahogany desk, topped with swathes of fabric, spools of thread, and leather-bound journals, is positioned kitty-corner to the room's exit, while an open round-topped door leads to the guest room."
