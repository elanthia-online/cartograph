  "description": [
    "Dozens of arrows litter the western side of the wooden tower, the crooked line of broken shafts and fletchings continuing down a dirt trail.  Coils of hempen rope dangle down from the open windows, hanging slightly above a shallow trench of jaw-filled traps intermixed with bones and dirt.  A single skeletal arm hangs out from the eastern window, a steel-barbed arrow still firmly clenched in its flesh-robbed fingers."
