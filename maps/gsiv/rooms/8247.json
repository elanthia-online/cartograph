    "Most of the floor is submerged under a shallow pool of brackish water.  A blanket of light green scum floats atop it.  Nothing remains of whatever furnished this room, save for a few rusted torch sconces along the southern wall.  A wooden doorway to the east remains intact, just out of the water's reach."
