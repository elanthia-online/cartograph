    "The layered slate walls of the cavern have been covered in thick bear hide, providing warmth as well as a way to muffle the sounds of workers loading stacks of leather and fabric into straw-filled crates.  Flanking a pair of cross-braced iron doors are racks of fur and dyes, the latter creating colorful designs upon the oak floorboards as they drip slowly across the grain."
