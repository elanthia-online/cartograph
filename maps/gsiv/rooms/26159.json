    "Whipping winds rush through the crenellation that tops the walls on the northern edge of the platform, while the southern edge looks down upon the ravaged and roofless remains of a long corridor.  A fitfully burning fire, its flames casting about from the ever-changing directions of the air, is barely contained by a stone box that helps support the bubbling iron cauldron that rests upon it."
