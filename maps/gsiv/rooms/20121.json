    "An algal mat covers the stretch of water just next to the shore, and further out, the water moves quickly, shifting and swirling, as the barely-there current carries it in a southwesterly direction.  Although clusters of cypress are visible further north, few trees are present here, the foliage instead dominated by wild brush."
