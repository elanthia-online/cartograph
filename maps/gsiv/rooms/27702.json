  "description": [
    "A small cross-hatched window looks out to the wilds beyond the gate, and a few torn, bloodied bandages hang along a series of nails hammered into its lower edge -- simple tokens testifying to the bravery of the local guard.  A long, winding staircase edges the round walls of the barbican tower, the shallow steps defended by an iron-barred gate."
