    "Sturdy wooden walls enclose the interior of this wagon, their surfaces sloshed with varying hues of red paint.  Overhead, a mosaic of a blue sea, complete with a large ship manned by a handful of halflings, is painted on the ceiling.  Several collections of daggers and swords hang on the walls, and a small writing desk covered with artistic sketches sits in one corner.  In the center of the room is a large table carved with a rough map and topped with an assortment of items."
