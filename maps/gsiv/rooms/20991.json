    "Surrounded on three sides by windows, the small room is largely open to the elements.  Dark bars prevent anything from climbing in through the windows, and an oak-framed arch is the only means of exiting the area.  Two low stools flank a small card table, which has been set with a stubby candle and an oiled zebrawood vessel of water."
