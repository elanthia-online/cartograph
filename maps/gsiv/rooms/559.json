    "The marshy terrain seeps up an incline as if crawling hand-by-hand, the way confiscated with thick cattails and reeds.  Shadowy trees begin to make solitary appearances, standing back from the willows as if they were second-class citizens.  However, these oak trees have a sinister air, with their black leaves and scabbed boles.",
