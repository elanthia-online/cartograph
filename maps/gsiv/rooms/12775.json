    "Large boulders contort a meager excuse for a path into a helter-skelter thread winding among the rocks.  Little can be seen other than the shoulders of tall outcroppings crowding around a small open tract of loose shale.  The ambient light is barely adequate for navigating hazardous crevices and sharp protrusions, and overhead, shadows cluster in deep rents and folds of stone.  Reddish light flickers in from a jagged crevice leading out of the tunnel, while smoke creates coiling shadows within its beam."
