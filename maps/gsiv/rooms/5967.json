    "A foul-smelling pond occupies a small clearing in the meadow grasses, its surface coated with a thick muck and its irregular edges surrounded by a border of mud.  Noisome mosquitoes dance above the still water, their incessant buzzing carried on a light breeze.  Around the edge of the pond, a chaotic array of imprints have been frozen in the thick layer of mud.",
    "A foul-smelling pond occupies a small clearing in the meadow grasses, its surface coated with a thick greenish muck and its irregular edges surrounded by a border of dark mud.  Noisome black flies and buzzing wasps dance above the still water, their incessant droning carried on a light breeze.  Around the edge of the pond, a chaotic array of imprints have been frozen in the thick layer of mud."
