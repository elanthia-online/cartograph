    "Tunnels veer off in three directions.  Air currents have quickened, carrying the stink of sulfur and fire.  To the south, the passageway widens, and a cavern is just visible around a bend of the walls.  Opposite that, a tunnel to the north leads into deep shadow, in which no landmarks are visible other than a churned up pile of stone at its mouth to lend hazard to the darkness."
