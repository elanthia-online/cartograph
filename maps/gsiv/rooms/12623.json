    "A section of the stone ceiling has broken away, revealing a web-like lattice of black glaes beneath.  With a shudder you try to imagine the unholy spider that could spin a web of unbreakable volcanic glass across a hundred foot chimney filled with fire and steam.  At least there is the hope that such an abomination, its labor complete, would have perished from the strain."
