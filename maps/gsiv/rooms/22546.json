    "A flock of lacquered ebonwood chests are strewn around the timeworn room, intensely contrasting against the ashen floor underfoot.  At the heart of the space, a wide green amber slab elevates a fauna-intaglio glaes casket littered with prismatic crystals.  An eerie pale sheen is cast over a faded driftwood sideboard, falling from an offering of half-melted beeswax candles gathered on the sides."
