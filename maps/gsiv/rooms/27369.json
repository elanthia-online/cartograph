    "[Giantman Village, Clearing]"

  "description": [
    "The surrounding flora has been cleared to create a sizeable space here.  Tents, lean-tos and other temporary structures cover the area, forming narrow streets through the miniature village.  Giantmen wander amongst the buildings on their way to daily tasks, some with their children in tow.  The children not pressed into labor play happily under the watchful eyes of their mothers."
