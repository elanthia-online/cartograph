    "Herbs planted in clay pots grow in a pungent tangle on a wide window ledge in this little cottage kitchen.  Beneath the window are a deep wooden washtub and a rack holding several strips of clean linen cloth.  A long plank table and several four-legged stools are positioned in the center of the kitchen and a heavy oak door leads to an outside garden.",
