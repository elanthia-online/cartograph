    "Stretching the expanse of one wall is the bas-relief mural of a traditional wild hunt.  The verdant pigments painted into the piece's terrain are echoed in the smooth floor tiles, while the warm browns are accented by the mahogany flooring.  Cherrywood tables and racks are placed throughout the shop, displaying their wares, and copper lanterns suspended from above offer ample illumination by which to shop."
