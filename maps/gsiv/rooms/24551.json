    "Sitting in the center of a large patch of fresh mown grass, the Jade Table almost vanishes into the surrounding greenery.  The short legs are artfully carved in the likenesses of snarling pumas, rising up on their hind legs as they support the jade tabletop.  The table is so low that no chairs are needed.  Small comfortable cushions are scattered around the grass nearby, several stacked under the table itself."
