    "Culminating in an alcove, the western end of the high-ceilinged narthex centers around a sculpture of polished brass.  Set atop a mosaic-tiled dais, the statue is many times taller than a living man.  Candles set in alcoves about the room lend their unified light to the metal, setting it brightly aglow."
