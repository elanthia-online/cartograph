  "description": [
    "The manor's rusted gate stands open, the corroded metal of its hinges having long since locked it in that position.  Beyond the gate, the manor house sits at the crest of the hill, its trim faded and the plaster cracked from years of neglect.  A stone tower stands atop a small rise at the hill's northern end, least affected of the buildings by time and circumstance."
