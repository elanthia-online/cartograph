    "The desolate moor gives up life to a jagged cliff of jet black volcanic rock and the grey sea beyond.  Cold wind carries the spray of the waves below against the rocks and howls up the face of the cliff below.  It draws a mournful wail from the dark stone as it hurtles onto the moor, blowing the tenacious shrubs into drawn and flat shadows of their normal shapes."
