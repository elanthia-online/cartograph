  "description": [
    "Narrow teak planks bound together by thick twine run the length of the wall.  In the rear of the room, a teak beaded curtain beckons entry.  A slightly lowered basin constructed around the floor is filled with sand and assorted seashells of all shapes and sizes.  A pair of evenly spaced palm trees leans over a long wooden footlocker in the center of the room."
