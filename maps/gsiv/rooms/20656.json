    "Artificial trees spread across the broad courtyard, wrought of shining steel with variegated foliage.  All across the expanse, dwarven attendants clamber up ladders in an attempt to reaffix hordes of fallen leaves.  Myriads of colorfully flecked toadstools cluster around the intersections of paths, marking them clearly even at a distance."
