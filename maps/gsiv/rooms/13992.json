    "Sharply contrasting with the grey stone walls, lush burgundy carpeting runs from wall to wall.  An elaborate desk stands opposite the heavy oak doors that separate this haven from the prison proper.  Bright with color, a collection of wall hangings decorates the office, placed just below small beveled glaes windows set high up on the walls.  Only a light drizzle of candlelight filters down from a chandelier meant to brighten the second-level loft, which is set above the northern end of the office."
