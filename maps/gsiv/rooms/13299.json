    "Clean white stucco walls run down to hand-tooled ebonwood wainscoting and up to brushed silver ceiling tiles all around this simple room.  A large rolled-edge mahogany counter separates the entrance from a narrow hall leading to various administrative offices.  A heavy rolled velvet rope stands in the way of further progress, a painted sign stating boldly, \"Under Construction.\""
