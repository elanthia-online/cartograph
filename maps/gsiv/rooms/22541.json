  "description": [
    "Standing atop the strange wagon, the view is impressive.  Several benches have been placed along the sides of the wagon.  Between them, an intricate painting of a gladiator's arena covers the wagon's flat top.  Two large pipes jut upwards from the rear of the wagon, providing a backstop for the low benches there.  A circular steel hatch leads back down into the wagon."
