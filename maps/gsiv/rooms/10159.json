    "Guelder rose and sarsaparilla bushes crop up in tiny patches along the sides of the pass, their ends wilted and slimy, the terrain growing a bit more rugged as it approaches the crest of the hill, upon which sits a dark forest.  Ahead, the thick growth of deciduous trees stretches southeast and is laden with choking veins and blackened ooze, while the trail returns to more open fields to the north."
