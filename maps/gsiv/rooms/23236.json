  "description": [
    "Several well-placed lanterns provide light for this spacious but simple chamber.  A simmering pot of aromatic mint leaves, fresh from the greenhouse, sits on a wood-burning stove.  Across the room a meticulously clothed daybed sits against a wall, opposite a modwir-framed painting.  Beneath the painting is a silver plaque."
