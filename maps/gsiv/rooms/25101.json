    "The dungeon slopes down and the path splits in two directions, one leading to a cell door, while the other leads further into darkness.  A streak of blackened fluid can be seen along both paths, and an eerie, incessant, tapping noise fills the hallway.  A narrow skylight is carved into the roof casting a spotlight on the intersection of the two paths."
