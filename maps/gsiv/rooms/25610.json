    "The Bard Guild Fest Hall is an expansive chamber, tiled with dark grey stone beneath the dark teak paneling of the walls.  Overhead, the ceiling is high, allowing mid-day heat to rise above the chamber's inhabitants, and giving headroom to the double rows of massive palms potted in likewise monumental urns.  Teak tables and comfortable-looking black leather armchairs provide a minimal, and strikingly elegant, tableau."
