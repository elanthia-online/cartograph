    "The road ends at a miasmal creek.  Below, visible through the fog, are the beams and crossties of an ancient, collapsed bridge.  A tree trunk, denuded of bark and branches, has been laid across the stream as a makeshift crossing.  Grass grows between the rutted tracks of the road leading east."
