    "Narrow tables laden with an assortment of armors, all obviously used, run along both sides of the wagon.  Runtahk Schen stands behind the hinged, fold-down counter, smiling pleasantly.  A pair of straw-filled dummies stand to either side of the entrance, one sans armor and quite severely hacked up, the other sporting badly cut and dented armor, but appearing otherwise intact."
