  "description": [
    "Subdued light provides the room with a warm glow as beeswax candles flicker in balenite sconces that line the honey oak walls.  A large umcor tapestry occupies one wall, while the others are adorned with smaller arras of varying cultural origins.  A long mahogany dining table lined with silk-cushioned high-back chairs dominates the room.  The scent of freshly baked bread wafts through a pair of white oak doors as they swing open for waitstaff delivering trays to a cherrywood sideboard.  A neat rubbish canister is tucked away in one corner."
