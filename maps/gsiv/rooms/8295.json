    "Your pace slackens along the path that wends its way between the thatched huts, as you pause to contemplate the stark building to the west.  The spider-shaped monument leaves you awed and humbled, almost feeling as though you were some sort of offering, transfixed in its web of shadows.  Paths continue on through the clearing, eventually trailing off into the dense, fragrant pine forest."
