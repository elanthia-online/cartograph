    "High above you a bat is careening in crazy arcs.  Suddenly, the bat folds his wings and falls in a screaming dive.  As the bat dips from view below the outer walls, you hear its shrill cry.",
    "High above you a peregrine falcon is circling in lazy spirals.  Its keen eyes ever vigilant for the slightest movement of prey, it seems to look down on the countryside as a king might his kingdom.  Suddenly, the hawk folds his wings and falls in a screaming dive.  As the hawk dips from view below the outer walls, you hear the shrill cry of its victory."
