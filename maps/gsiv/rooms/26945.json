    "High travertine walls line the avenue before giving way to manicured cypress trees that stretch towards the star-spangled sky.  Quintuple rings, each overlapping the other, are inlaid into the smooth, glass-like walls that flank the open doublewide doors leading into the Needle of Pentas.  Brightly glowing frosted globes dangle over the entry, the fiery spheres dispelling the encroaching night."
