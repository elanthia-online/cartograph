  "description": [
    "A heavy mist hangs in the air like a gathering storm, impeding visibility in this deep and humid cavern.  Disturbed by a multitude of sealife below its surface, a large pool ripples constantly, thin indigo-hued tendrils darting to and fro across its glassy top.  A makeshift pier, crafted from moss-covered planks, juts out from the grotto's rocky edge and provides a perfect fishing perch."
