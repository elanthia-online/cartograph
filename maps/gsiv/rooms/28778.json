  "description": [
    "Paneled walls with rich blue and silver insets frame the cozily close chamber.  The air within is dry and redolent with complex herbal notes, the odor arising from a polished cedarwood humidor positioned at one end of a sumptuous leather couch that stretches along most of one wall.  Moonlight gleams through a frosted glass window depicting prowling wolves and prancing bucks, feebly illuminating the outline of a luxuriant leather seat with a smoky halo.  A crystal snifter catches the light, sitting atop a patterned silver tray near the door."
