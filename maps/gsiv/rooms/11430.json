    "This circular chamber contains a single bench which runs along the wall.  No other seat is available, except the floor, in order that everyone may look into the eyes of every other person here.  By design of the proprietor, this configuration is intended to force honesty, or at least acceptance of one's actions, upon those who discuss weighty matters."
