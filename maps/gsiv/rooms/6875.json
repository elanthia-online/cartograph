    "The kitchen is a whirlwind of ordered chaos.  Assistants, corporeal and non, bustle about tending pots and preparing ingredients in a masterfully orchestrated dance.  Their choreographer is a massive zombie wearing an oversized chef's hat, who shouts orders in a voice loud enough to rattle the glass in the windows.  A trapdoor dominates one corner of the room, presumably leading down to the cellar space."
