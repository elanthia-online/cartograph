  "description": [
    "Several labeled boxes have been stacked up in the corners of the office, kept out of the way of the foreman's daily routine.  An iron-studded chest sits against the side of a brass-accented desk, secured by a giant steel padlock.  Pelt and hide samples rest atop the highest tiers of a metal shelf, while the lower levels display a few pieces of children's artwork."
