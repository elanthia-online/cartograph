    "A massive black marble fireplace is set into the western wall, working hard to heat the large room.  Lacquered ebonwood floorboards are covered with dark green woolen rugs, and a low dark green granite table rests between a plush black sable couch and a soft umber velvet lounge.  Standing in one corner next to a square mahogany bar with gold inlay is a rose gold display."
