    "An impenetrable briar thicket surrounds you to the east and west, blocking further exploration of this foul smelling mire.  To the north, the underbrush has been cut back and a narrow pathway can be traversed.  A lone crypt, nearly lost in the mass of briars, is the only structure still standing amidst piles of broken headstones."
