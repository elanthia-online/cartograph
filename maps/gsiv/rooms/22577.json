    "Just beyond a thick curtain of heavy black velvet is a bi-level cubicle featuring a narrow sleeping loft with crude ladder along one side.  Underneath is a small work area lined with shelves holding all sorts of supplies, with the rest of the tiny room left open.  A crude window grimy with dirt obscures the view, serving mostly to let in light to brighten the space."
