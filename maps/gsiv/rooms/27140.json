    "Spreading a thick canopy over this part of the meadow, an ancient red oak tree towers above.  Its broad, gnarled trunk is decorated with beribboned garlands of roses, hydrangia, and blaestonberry blossoms.  A gentle breeze meanders through the shaded clearing, adding to the moist chill of the evening."
