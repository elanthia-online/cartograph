    "Standing against one wall, a trio of colorful mannequins displays their bright and vivid wares.  A central pole carved of white oak stands tall creating a peaked ceiling, a large narrow mirror hanging from its length.  A wooden partition of slatted modwir creates a small dressing space, several discarded items draped over the top."
