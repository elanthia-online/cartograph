    "Overwhelmed by the surrounding jungle, a large teak building disappears into the greenery.  A grouping of amber and chime trees grows on either side of the path, their trunks surrounded by bushes and huge leafy ferns.  Standing off to the side is a monkey topiary that seems to be hopping on one leg."
