  "description": [
    "The calls of shopkeepers hawking their wares arises from the town just below this narrow cliffside trail.  Minstrels wander through the visible streetscapes, lending the melodies of instruments and song to the sounds rising from below.  Accompanied by the ceaseless pounding of the ocean waves beyond, the cacophony echoes rhythmically off the surrounding, vertical cliff face."
