    "Families and friends who wished a last farewell to the dead congregated here.  A mammoth stone pedestal sitting in the middle of the room is rounded near the top edges.  Only its frequent use could have caused such wear.  The pedestal is ringed by ceremonial candle holders that cascade around it."
