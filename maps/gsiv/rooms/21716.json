    "Sprawled around the room are several wooden armor stands in various stages of decomposition and repose.  A few still remain upright, bearing their long-forgotten burdens proudly, while others have succumbed to the ravages of time and rot, depositing their charges unceremoniously on the rough plank floor.  A few cobweb-covered helmets hang from rusty iron spikes that have been driven into one wall.  A large archway in the northern wall leads out to the western battlements."
