  "description": [
    "This grand hall still echoes with the ghosts of powerful people and momentous happenings.  A great firepit dominates the center of the room, its sides lined with ceramic tiles.  A steel block sits next to the table, waist-high and as long as a man is tall.  A hammer-shaped impression is left in the dust, but there doesn't seem to be a hammer in the room.  Twenty niches are set into the walls, each with a panel in the back.  One of the panels has collapsed, revealing a lifesized steel statue."
