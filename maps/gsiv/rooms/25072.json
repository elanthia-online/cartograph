    "The stairwell ends abruptly in a pit of cracked, moss-covered cobblestone, a crater amidst the otherwise smooth flooring of the dungeon.  A single torch with bits of dried blood on the marred handle is affixed to one wall.  Past the rubble, the dungeon opens up, but the sputtering torchlight gives no clues as to what may be found."
