  "description": [
    "Stone walls give off a cool respite from the heat reflected off rock outside.  A large boulder has been outfitted as a bar, its surface carved down into a semblance of a level counter.  Stone tables are surrounded by flimsy wooden stools.  Obviously, the priority in this establishment does not rest with fly-by-night furnishings fashioned from wood.  A figurehead mounted above the bar appears to be the moth-eaten, stuffed head of a troll.  Its dusty countenance is disgusting."
