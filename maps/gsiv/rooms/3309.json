  "description": [
    "Lit only by a single iron-sconced torch east of the gated entrance, this ice-enclosed cavern is filled with an unwelcoming silence and a sense of foreboding.  To the northwest, countless stalagmites of crystalline ice jut wickedly upwards towards a suspended rope bridge far above the penitentiary floor.  Garbed in hooded black robes, a pair of grizzled halflings guard a thick imflass-chain ladder that leads upwards into the Icewall."
