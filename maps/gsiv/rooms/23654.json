  "description": [
    "Surrounded by painted white paper screens trapped in bamboo frames, the triangular patio is tiled with large squares of glazed, tangerine terracotta.  Planted in the northeastern and northwestern corners of the small, roofless enclosure is a pair of plumeria trees, while the center of the space is dotted with white iron tables and chairs.  Several verdant bamboo saplings have been planted on the edges, and provide shade near each of the entries that lead back into the guild."
