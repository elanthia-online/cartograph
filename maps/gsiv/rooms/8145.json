    "Moonlight streams down into the circular building from an opening in the domed ceiling.  Around the walls, niches at each point of the compass are filled with statuary.  A marble altar with flaring edges, supported by two arching pedestal legs, stands against the far wall.  In the room's center is a round, marble-edged pool.  Drops of water fall from the dome's \"eye\" into the pool like tears."
