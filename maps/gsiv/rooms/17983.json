    "Bags of flour, potatoes, onions and herbs stand in this spacious pantry.  Large containers of dry food have been sorted and stacked among the shelves in groups.  A few pots and pans hang from the surrounding walls as light from a nearby window reflects off of them, sending rays of light throughout the pantry."
