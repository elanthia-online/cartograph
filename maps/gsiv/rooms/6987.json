    "The dilapidated road runs parallel to the cliff face here.  Although no trees have dared to take root in the road, a number of large stones have fallen from the face above, littering the road with rock and debris.  A large boulder has made a significant impact on the road, buckling and cracking its surface.  The road runs east and west along the base of the cliff."
