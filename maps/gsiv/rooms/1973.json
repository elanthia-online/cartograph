    "At this end of the narrow alleyway, the mouth of the slot canyon opens onto a main thoroughfare, now mostly dark except for the oil lamps that light the way.  Sitting in a niche carved into the canyon wall is a small iron bell, a miniature memorial to Khazi Khazar.",
    "At this end of the narrow alleyway, the mouth of the slot canyon opens onto a main thoroughfare, creating a busy junction for both merchants and customers.  Sitting in a niche carved into the canyon wall is a small iron bell, a miniature memorial to Khazi Khazar.  Occasionally, a young child pauses to ring the tintinnabulum, only to be guided back to the business at hand by an earnest parent."
