    "Centered in the tent, a thick pole creates a sharp peak in the canopy, which slopes down to an ironwood post at each corner.  A worn grey carpet covers the ground, stained with mud, leaves, and other debris tracked in from the mire outside.  Lengths of rope travel across the ceiling, creating a tangled crisscrossed pattern and display a wide variety of kites."
