    "A herd of urghs grazes off to the southeast, their dark backs barely visible above the tall grasses.  Occasionally one raises its tusked head as if sniffing at the breeze then resumes foraging.  To the north the edge of a large forest looms on the horizon, and dark clouds gather further back, with flashes of lightning punctuating the dark, billowy mass.  The presence of only a slight wind in the area indicates that the storm does not seem to be headed this way."
