    "The ceiling rapidly ascends into a point overhead, while the walls bow inward, distorting any sense of stability.  The walls are covered with blackened soot, a contrast to the otherwise pristine condition of the castle.  Ethereal light flickers errantly across the flooring, ceiling, and darkened walls."
