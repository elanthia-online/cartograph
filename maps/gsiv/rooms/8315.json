  "description": [
    "The black stones are highly polished, and reflect a grotesque, distorted image back at you as you gaze up at the arched, convex rear wall of the temple.  At sharp angles, two wings of the building meet the main structure.  Your route weaves along the bends in the exterior, forcing you to make your way carefully and warily."
