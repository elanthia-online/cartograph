    "A thick carpet of ash has turned this small area of jungle into a grey alien wasteland.  Bare and blackened trees stretch towards the hazy sky like scorched fingers, and fronds the size of giantmen lie scattered upon the ground, their surfaces dark and crumbling.  One large tree in particular has been completely split in two from root to top, and a wide circle of pitch black earth surrounds its ruined trunk.  A fallen tree limb arches over a stream, providing dry passage to the other side."
