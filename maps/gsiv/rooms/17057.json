    "Intaglio carvings cover the walls of the narrow stone tunnel, which rises upward toward a bright opening to the east.  Steps barely visible to the eye are hewn into the floor of the tunnel, offering some purchase for those wishing to pass through its dark length.  The air is disturbed by a faint breeze flowing westward back toward the caverns."
