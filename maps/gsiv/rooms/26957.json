    "High travertine walls converge upon an enormous dome that completely seals the garden off from the outside elements.  Waves of hot, arid air radiate outward from the russet terracotta tiles that form the ambling pathways, while dimly glowing lights lend the area a feeling of perpetual twilight.  Two large, blackened stone boulders flank the entry like silent sentinels."
