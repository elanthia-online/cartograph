  "description": [
    "Small and cozy, the intimate study is lined with shelves filled with various books and volumes.  A small basket of sticks rests next to a large stone fireplace adorned with a thick oak mantle.  Tucked into a corner is a mistwood writing desk, its surface cluttered with various inkwells, parchments, and quills with a matching mistwood chair placed in front.  A large dart board hangs over an oak dartboard rack, which sits caddy-corner to a small tiled bar covered with a varied selection of food and drink."
