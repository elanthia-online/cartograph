    "The vast range of the Dragonspine Mountains is visible in the distant east.  The valley beneath is heavily forested with mighty aspens whose leaves shimmer and glisten in the winds that swirl down from the distant heights.  Amid the silvery forest, the shadowy form of a grove of seven massive modwir trees can be discerned, translucent and wavering as if a mirage."
