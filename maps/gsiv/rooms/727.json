  "description": [
    "A wide, lancet arch pierces a gatehouse to the north, while grey stone walls stretch to the east and west to enclose a courtyard where the green domes of hawthorn trees reach above the top of the wall and mute the constant ring of hammer against anvil.  Narrow stripes of heat-distorted air rise skyward between the treetops."
