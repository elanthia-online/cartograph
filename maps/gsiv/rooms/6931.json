    "A small overhang on the south side of the tower provides the on-duty guards with some shelter from the elements.  From there, you can see the roofs of the town buildings to the south and southeast.  Directly south, you can see a large open square among the buildings.  Your view east is blocked by another guard tower.  To the north, you can see the road that leads to the main gate of Wehnimer's and beyond it, to the shoreline.",
