  "description": [
    "The dense leaf-shrouded and vine-entangled branches surrounding this side of the platform create a near-spherical space of respite within the tree.  A sturdy frond-woven hammock tied between two thick boughs swings lazily to and fro with each passing breeze.  In one corner, a small glass jar hanging from a nearly invisible wire swirls with tiny yellow motes of light."
