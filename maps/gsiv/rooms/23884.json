    "Frames of thick bamboo create the makeshift walls of the shop, the wood covered by drapes of raw cream linen and tightly bound by hempen rope.  Stacked against the thick fabric confines are a pair of leather trunks, their lids locked in place alongside a doily-covered silk valise.  A vellum screen of fauna cut-outs separates the rooms of the wagon, the three-sided divider dyed shades of pastel green and lavender, matching the checkered paeline rug covering the floor."
