    "The paths that once led between the buildings of the village have been strangled by the teeming mass of thorny vines and small bushes that have already engulfed nearly everything within sight.  Nearby, the meeting hall is nearly hidden amid the tangle of vines, and the temple door is barely passable due to the great clumps of feeders hanging down from its high arch."
