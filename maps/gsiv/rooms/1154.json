    "A reptilian creature resting on a small dry area hops quickly into the water, startled by the movement.  Salamanders and lizards dart around the edges of the swamp looking for an easy insect meal.  The pervasive smell of decay rises up from the mushy ground and hangs heavily in the stagnant air.  An occasional frog breaks the quiet background noise with a loud croak."
