    "Fields of corn lie off the path to the north, and fields of tobacco to the south.  The smell of the crops is invigorating, but pollen hanging in the air is enough to make a dwarf sneeze.  Barrels and small carts, fully functional, have been left trustingly by the side of the path near the fields."
