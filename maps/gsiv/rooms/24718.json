  "description": [
    "The ancient ground here holds an almost ruddy hue, as if copious amounts of blood once stained the dirt and time itself could not fully cleanse it.  A withering field stretches along the eastern outskirts of the village, enclosed by broken segments of bones fashioned together to resemble a macabre fence."
