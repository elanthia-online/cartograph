    "A handful of hearty luminescent toadstools illuminate the darkness of this cellar, revealing the ice-slicked floor and frosted metal rails against the walls.  Glistening, semi-frozen moss hangs across a darkened archway that houses a wide staircase to the upper floor.  Occasionally, an attendant garbed in a heavy cloak wanders into the cellar to lay bundles of fresh towels on two stone racks."
