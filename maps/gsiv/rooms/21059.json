    "Sourced in the northern river, cascades of water slide past a narrow gully before falling further down to the delta basin.  The rocky promontory above protects this small cavern hollowed out of the highland by the channel.  Though sheets of water curtain the cave mouth, access points, one to the west up a ridge toward the coastal cliffs, and the other to the southwest across a splash-washed land bridge toward the lowland, make it possible for both predator and prey to roam this space at will."
