    "Two marble statues fashioned in the form of heavily muscled male warriors are locked together at the foot of a wide granite pedestal.  Toppled from their lofty perch, the once heroic figures now have the somewhat humorous appearance of boys rolling about in the dirt.  One statue is half-buried in the weed-riddled earth, as if forced beneath the ground by the hands of the second statue whose arms are locked about its head in a classic wrestlers' pose."
