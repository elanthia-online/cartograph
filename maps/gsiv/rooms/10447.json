    "The tall vine-covered outer wall dominates the eastern section of this area and curves around to the south.  The trampled grass near the edges of the wall shows evidence of the frequent patrols of militia that protect this grassy sward.  Only a few tents have been set up in this area, the occasional shopper can be seen wandering in from both the west and north.",
    "In the dark, the outer walls to the east and south appear as large black obstacles.  The trampled grass near the edges of the wall shows evidence of the frequent patrols of militia that protect this grassy sward.  Only a few tents have been set up in this area, the occasional shopper can be seen wandering in from both the west and north."
