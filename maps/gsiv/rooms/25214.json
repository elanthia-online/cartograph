  "description": [
    "A veritable maze opens here, a myriad of passages cut from the cavernous walls stretching out before you.  There is a thick coating of dust covering the craggy ground, the faint outlines of footprints barely visible in the murky darkness of the room.  From somewhere beyond the range of sight, a soft shuffling sound is heard from within the twisting tunnels."
