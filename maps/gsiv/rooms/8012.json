  "description": [
    "A tiny, crowded and narrow cave apparently used as storage.  Piles of crude picks and shovels lie heaped everywhere to rust and rot in the damp air.  The remains of several greasy animal skin sacks give off the pungent scent of some sort of oil but appear to be beyond use.  A large pile of crushed and bent iron caps sit, heaped in one corner, next to a broken anvil where they were repaired."
