    "The wagon has limited lighting spaced out and focused to shine on a blackened counter and a sturdy rack while keeping most of the area in shadows.  A modwir sign sits against the counter half lit by one of the lights overhead.  There is a persistent musty smell coming through the curtained door at the back of the wagon."
