  "description": [
    "Cobblestone Court's great circle is paved with granite cobblestones, each with the name of a family donating money or goods to help construct the neighborhood.  Masons carefully set the stones, then sealed them with a moisture-resistant resin to preserve the inscriptions.  Gutters run the circumference of the curving road, taking away excess rainwater."
