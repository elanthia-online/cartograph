    "A peculiarly long, thin stone table rests near the northern wall of the tavern, with ample chairs scattered on either side of it.  The table has been hewn from one lengthy piece of white marble, then rounded and mounted on two thick slabs to give the impression of a gigantic white piccolo resting in a stone holder.  The table is thin enough to accommodate close, quiet, intimate conversation with a person seated across.  Then, again, it is also narrow enough to serve as an excellent location for arm wrestling."
