    "Lacquered cedar walls sport a number of animal-head trophies mounted on wooden plaques next to dimly lit sconces.  A group of rowdy drunken gentlemen sit off in a corner at one of the circular oak tables, which are scattered about the room, using curved wooden benches for seating.  A grand chair made from the cured hide of a large animal rests near a large stone fireplace."
