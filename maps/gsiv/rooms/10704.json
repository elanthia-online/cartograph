    "The outer wall jumps dramatically in height as it continues to the east, before leveling off at nearly eight feet.  The inner wall droops and soars like a dragon's twisting tail flying through the night.  Large bones, white as a ghost and starkly contrasted against the nighttime sky, cap both walls.  The smooth surface of the outer wall is interupted by ghastly crenellations formed from humanoid skulls.",
