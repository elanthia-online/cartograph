    "The unfinished walls of the room support a few torches giving off sufficient light to examine the shop's wares.  The smell of oiled leather mixes with their scent.  At the far end of the room, a row of hooks hang directly over a large wooden box lined with soft grey felt, and a multi-armed display stand is situated near the entrance to the shop's next area.  A small sign has been nailed to a dented and punctured wood door."
