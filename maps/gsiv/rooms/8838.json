    "An army of carved rocks stands in the heat, each statue throwing a shadow over a miscellany of smaller stones in its lee.  Rock buildings ring the central tableau, like an audience watching a sport of combat.  Curtains in the windows reveal the buildings to be residences, although the exteriors more resemble roadside huts.",

Rock buildings ring the central tableau, like an audience watching a sport of combat.  Curtains in the windows reveal the buildings to be residences, although the exteriors more resemble roadside huts."
