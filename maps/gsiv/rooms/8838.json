    "An army of carved rocks stands in the heat, each statue throwing a shadow over a miscellany of smaller stones in its lee.

Curtains in the windows reveal the buildings to be residences, although the exteriors more resemble roadside huts.",

Rock buildings ring the central tableau, like an audience watching a sport of combat.  Curtains in the windows reveal the buildings to be residences, although the exteriors more resemble roadside huts."
