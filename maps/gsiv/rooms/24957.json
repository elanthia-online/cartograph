  "description": [
    "Sweeping to the west, this large garden is filled with wonderful scents.  A narrow brick pathway winds around the plants like the coiled tail of a dragon.  Violets, daffodils, daisies, and other colorful flowers rise up from the rich black soil, and a wheelbarrow full of gardening tools and bulbs rests, almost hidden, behind some rose bushes.  Bordering the walls, sunflowers are in full bloom, obscuring the view of the outside world, and in a secluded corner of the garden lies a small marble alcove."
