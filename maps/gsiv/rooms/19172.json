  "description": [
    "Various chutes, pipes, and conduits open out into this room, conveying an occasional load of rubbish.  The floor is cleverly constructed of tightly spaced wood lattice, allowing the smaller bits to fall into the fetid bilgewater below while keeping the larger detritus available for sorting.  A frayed rope ladder dangles down from some unseen vantage overhead."
