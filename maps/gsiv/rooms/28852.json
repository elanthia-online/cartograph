  "description": [
    "A low, illuminated ceiling, bright with gilt and crowded with painted images of grotesque revelry, hangs over the entrance of the temple.  The air is close and still, and the fragrance of clinging, soporific smoke is thick.  The latter's source is a series of pierced metal censers set in wall niches to either side of the inlaid bronze doors leading out into the unevenly torchlit darkness beyond."
