    "A small hut looms closer as the sandy path continues to climb upward toward the top of the hill.  A large piece of driftwood, its surface smooth and laden with small wormholes, lies across the pathway, almost blocking further progress.  Small, immature palm trees dot the slope, attempting to get a stronghold on the sandy soil.",

A large knothole in the driftwood serves as a holder for the torch brightening this section of the trail.  Small, immature palm trees dot the slope, attempting to get a stronghold on the sandy soil."
