    "At the top of a tightly-woven hemp ladder, a small platform rises above the treeline, providing a spectacular view.  A pair of great horned owls tend to their young in a nest on a nearby branch.  Broken hatchling shells are scattered around the nest amongst fresh pellets and molted feathers.  Carved on the silver tree trunk are some ancient runes."
