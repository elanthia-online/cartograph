    "Painted tree trunks stretch toward the ceiling in varicolored shades of brown and ivory, and against the deep blue firmament above are a trio of moons.  Moonlight in the form of silvery white paint dapples the foliage of the trees, and a thick hay-packed target has been affixed to the wall as if hung from one of the trees.  Off to one side of the suede-backed feather curtain is a slotted dark oak stand, and across the walkway is a faded velvet-lined box."
