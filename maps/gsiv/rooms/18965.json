    "The surfaces of this room glow brightly as if something is disturbing the essence of the materials themselves.  The ironwood planking and mammoth tusk ivory swirl and blur, making it difficult to see the actual outlines of the walls.  An unseen, unfelt wind ripples the white polar bear fur carpet, and the ceiling appears to expand and contract.  The outlines of robed figures suddenly appear as dark spots on the walls only to fade into the bright glow."
