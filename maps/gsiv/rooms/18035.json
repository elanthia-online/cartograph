    "A flattened muddy patch of snow trampled by several people shows signs of a small group huddled together, trying to stay warm in the mists from the nearby spring.  The fountain is a popular gathering place for the locals to enjoy a leisurely exchange of news and stories before wading home through tall drifts."
