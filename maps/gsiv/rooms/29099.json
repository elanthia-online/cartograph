    "Crates, boxes, and shipping containers clutter the back of the shop.  The sturdy wooden structures create a wall that stretches to the ceiling.  Along the northern and southern walls, open shipping containers provide a view of the wares that are for sale.  A long glossy counter crafted of oak provides a centralized location to place orders, its smooth surface clean and tidy."
