  "description": [
    "Scattered in all directions, open-faced huts surround this central clearing, which obviously serves as a gathering spot that is not completely choked with foliage and growth.  A large fire pit dominates the area, charred wood composing its innards.  Several short lines of faint red dirt radiate outward from the fire pit to the edge of the area.  Through the green ferns and tall jungle trees, the low clicks and whispering of hidden villagers is audible, and thin shafts of sunlight stream through from above."
