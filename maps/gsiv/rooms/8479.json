    "Tattered bits of cloth litter the floor.  A twisted and mangled clothing rack lies discarded in the corner, and shelves have been half torn from their braces to hang precariously from the walls.  A rickety ladder leans in the corner, heading up through a trapdoor in the roof to what you presume is the attic."
