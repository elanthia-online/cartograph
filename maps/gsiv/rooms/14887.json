    "Leaves blanket the ground, creating a slippery climb up a steep hillside, leading to the peak of a ridge.  Low branches extend out, serving as handholds for traversing the slope as the minimal path winds between fallen boulders and trees.  A swift stream rushes along its channel at the base of the rise."
