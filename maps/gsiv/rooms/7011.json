  "description": [
    "A great cauldron hangs upside down on a hinged mount on the edge of the parapet, having dumped its contents long ago in a desperate attempt to thwart attackers.  The sooty marks around its base suggest that it was formerly heated over an open fire.  A guardtower lies to the east along the parapet, and the parapet itself continues to the west."
