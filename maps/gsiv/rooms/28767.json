  "description": [
    "The lobby is lit by a massive copper fixture, suspended by chains from the vaulted wood beam ceiling and set with hundreds of burning candles.  Central and opposite the entry doors is a sweeping wood-and-stone staircase, flanked on the ground floor by some copper-framed glass panels and a pointed mahogany arch.  Elegant and rustic elements of design mesh gracefully in the large chamber, where walls with squared hunter green panels meet with a polished birchwood floor."
