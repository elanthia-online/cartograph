    "Displaying an obvious contrast in design, the canvas-covered room is divided in two along the lines of a large knotted oak support post.  Upon the western side, the room is filled with cabinets and carved tables that show a distinct artisan's touch, while the eastern side is riddled with barnacle-laced cupboards and counters that are waterlogged and warped.  A brightly illuminated flap leads northwest and stands opposite a plain, dimly light opening.",
