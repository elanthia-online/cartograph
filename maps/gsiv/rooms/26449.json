    "Constantly rushing air swirls about the ravine as it forcefully pushes its way out of a dark hole in the ground, its tenacious presence causing the miasmic mist and murk to vacate the area.  Deep, bone-jarring sounds, punctuated by an off-key whistle, reverberate off the shale making it difficult to hear anything in this confined space.  Despite the lack of mist, the darkness created by the high, black walls of the ravine make it difficult to see more than a hand's span away."
