    "Flickering candlelight creates more shadow than illumination in the cramped cobblestone room, which is deprived of windows and floored with packed dirt.  Thick wrought iron pegs line the eastern wall, each laden with a different mask, while wicker baskets are arranged upon the floor opposite an oak and copper door.  A coal-filled blackened brazier emits a warm, inviting orange light, though it does little to heat anything further than a handspan from its home on the eastern side of the room."
