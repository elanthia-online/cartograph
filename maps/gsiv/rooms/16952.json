  "description": [
    "Several tables, chairs, and low bookshelves are arranged throughout the atrium, spread across the wide tile floor.  Individual figures sit absorbed in their studies, while small groups of mages hold muted discussions all about the hall.  The atrium walls are speckled with reflected light and stretch high above, interrupted by the open overlooks of the second and third floors, to culminate in an arched glass ceiling.  At each corner of the atrium, a pair of gilded columns lead back to the book-lined halls of the library."
