    "A riot of plants fills this room, taking up nearly all of the space on the tile floor.  The walls and ceiling are made of large panes of glass that allow plenty of light to enter, though the view to the outside has been all but obscured by the luxuriant growth.  Small paths wind among the plants, allowing access to them all.  In the center of the room is a small tiered marble fountain with water trickling from the top and down the sides, to pool in the basin below."
