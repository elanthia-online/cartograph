    "Crystal walls act as a prism for light reflected from candles attached to the rounded walls of this room.  Light from the fireplace illuminates a bed that has been fashioned from a single tree, while the smaller branches are expertly bent and woven to fashion tables, chairs and the frame of a mirror."
