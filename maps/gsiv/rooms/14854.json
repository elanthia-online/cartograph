    "Rough weathered fieldstone steps pursue a curving path down the shadowy slope of a bluff.  Dense stands of deciduous trees gather atop the bluff, as though standing guard against the intrusion of the moonlit meadow below.  Lichens clinging to the rough surface of the trees' bark glow in the murk, as though trying to illuminate the foliage of large rhododendrons and ferns crowding at the foot of the trees.",

The rich tones of their lichen and moss-covered bark complement the healthy green foliage of large rhododendrons and ferns crowding their foot."
