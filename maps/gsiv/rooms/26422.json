    "Traversing the steep slope, either toward, or away from, the water is equally treacherous, with loose scree and jagged rocks to either side of the walkway.   Frantically swaying brass lanterns illuminate a large dock below, as it rises and falls in tempo with the waves.  Salt spray rhythmically buffets this section of the stairway, making the footing slick and vision even more difficult in the fog encumbered, nightime environs.",

A large dock below rises and falls in tempo with the waves, straining against its mooring chains with each passing swell.
