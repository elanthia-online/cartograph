  "description": [
    "A cluster of ancient oaks forms a quiet glade, their heavy branches and foliage concealing anything above from view.  Several carved wooden benches are arranged on the mossy ground between the massive trees, set by the banks of a bubbling spring that emerges from a niche in the forest floor and flows between the roots.  A sturdy wooden pavilion opens to the south, half-covered by bushes and flowering vines, and a wide ladder leads up the gnarled trunk of the largest of the oaks."
