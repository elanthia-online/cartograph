    "Keeping guard over the walkway are several marble statues garbed in some burnished mithril armor.  A narrow path branches off towards a thin steel marker and subsequently, a small limestone shed.  Colorful fungus abounds in carefully tended beds that border the expansive courtyard to the east."
