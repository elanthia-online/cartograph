    "A stand of tree ferns occupies the shadows of the northwest corner of the area, their tree-like trunks extending far into the canopy to push the massive leaves through the overlaying mist.  In contrast, the clusters of ferns growing closer to the floor flourish in the hazy moonlight admitted between the capirona trees inhabiting the jungle.  The stems of twisting, braided liana vines mingle with the shadows, their enshrouded forms strikingly similar to dangling snakes as they sway in the night breeze."
