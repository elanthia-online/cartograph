  "description": [
    "A framing of thick bamboo holds heavy canvas sheets stretched tightly across the support work to form this small office.  Here and there slits in the canvas allow the sunlight to filter through, and the cant of the double roofed canvas is enough to prevent rain from streaming in through the openings.  A simple driftwood desk occupies a corner with a wicker chair behind it while several other wicker chairs lazily pose around the limestone floor.  Torches await the onset of night."
