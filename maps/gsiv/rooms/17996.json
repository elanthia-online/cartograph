    "Crates, cartons, oaken boxes, and iron-bound coffers are stacked along the walls.  The containers bear the labels and insignia of the various inns, cartage companies, Houses, museums, temples, and public agencies from which they were filched.  Some are quite old and covered with dust, while others are clearly recent acquisitions."
