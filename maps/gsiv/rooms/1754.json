  "description": [
    "Sturdy pines and spreading spruces dominate this part of the forest.  Their branches hang heavily with the weight of accumulated snow, and clumps of snow drop constantly to the ground.  The snowfall is thick, and the wind swirls it around.  Southward, vision clears a bit, as does the forest.  The trees are massed closest to the lake, and their abundance drops off drastically in direct proportion to their distance from the lakeshore."
