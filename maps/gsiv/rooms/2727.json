    "Stretching higher than can be seen, the great frozen peak rises into the sky.  The southern face appears treacherous at best, jagged ice and rock rise in a steep slope until fading out of sight.  The swirling snow and wind keep the vision a blur, but it appears to meet the tundra to the east."
