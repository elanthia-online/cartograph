    "An ivy-covered wall surrounds this small, enclosed courtyard.  Several comfortable tables, resting on tiles set into the close-cropped grass, are scattered about the courtyard, with plenty of room between them for privacy.  You faintly hear the sounds of the city coming from the other side of the wall, and in the distance you can see the towers of the temple as they rise over the rest of the city."
