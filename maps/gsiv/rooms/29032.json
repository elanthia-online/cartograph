  "description": [
    "Stretching like long fingers towards the ocean, the docking structure has five distinct piers that provide ample room for portage.  A large sign provides directions to the various berths, the instructions painted in several colors upon a black background, while a constantly burning lantern rests above.  Three tie pilings border the western edge of the platform, while two more are arranged upon the east."
