    "Despite its obvious age, the house is small and cozy, with colorful rugs lining the ramshackle floor.  A collection of paintings hang from the walls, which are freshly painted in pale greens bordered by fanciful vinework and inset with clean, ivory-curtained windows.  Two chairs sit in front of a merrily burning hearth, while, situated just under an embroidered sign, a long wooden table covered in an ivory runner displays a variety of knives."
