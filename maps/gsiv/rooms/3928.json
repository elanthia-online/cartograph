  "description": [
    "The mouths of a number of tunnels circle the walls of the cavern, leading off into darkness.  In the center of the area, where the tunnel trails converge, is a pillar of stacked stones.  The construction stands lonely guard over the junction, casting a faint, disjointed shadow across the hard floor of the cavern."
