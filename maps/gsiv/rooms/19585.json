    "Bright orange terra cotta tiles decorate the houses that line the southern edge of the street, while bright white paints create a uniform look to each of their facades.  Shutters, in a plethora of colors, decorate the homes and stand open to the sunlight.  Positioned at the end of a stone-lined walkway, a pale coral-tiled office sits in the middle of a manicured lawn of verdant green jungle grass.",

Shutters, in a plethora of colors, decorate the homes and are closed to the cooler airs of the night.
