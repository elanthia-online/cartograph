    "The centerpiece of the room is a wrought copper altar, which is housed upon a cerulean tile mosaic floor.  Flanking the altar on either side are brightly lit sun-shaped scones, their flickering luminosity casting a golden glow on the room.  Set within the high, pallid birch ceiling is a broad skylight, angled perfectly above the altar, and a copper-framed glass case is pressed up against one of the muslin-draped walls.  Near the entrance is a sturdy azure mithril counter, placed below an intricate brass-framed mirror."
