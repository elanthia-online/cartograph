    "Bright green pitcher plants are interspersed between the trunks of cedar trees that rise along the banks of the river.  The plants' vibrant purple and white flowers hang down, their wide petals collecting moisture from the misty air.  Small foot and tail tracks are evident in the sandy earth lining the water's edge."
