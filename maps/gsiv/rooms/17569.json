  "description": [
    "Set in the sturdy structure to the south, a large window looks out from the back of the shop into the stall, a large sunflower-filled window box just below its lower panes.  Bright yellow sunflowers with sienna middles create a striking contrast between the two shades, further highlighting the yellow and brown hues of dyes filling the rows upon rows of buckets lined up against the western and northern white canvas walls."
