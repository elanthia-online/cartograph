    "The ground rises just a smidge here, leaving somewhat drier footing along this part of the path.  Nestled in a bed of dry grass near a half-hollowed tree trunk is a massive overturned tortoise shell, its undercarriage missing and interior thoroughly cleaned.  Overhead, a few stiff tree limbs reach from beneath shrouds of grey moss to snatch at passersby."
