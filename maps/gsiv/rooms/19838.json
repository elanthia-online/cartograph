    "High vaulted windows line the walls of this large room, letting the light fall in muted tones on the sinuous contours of the teaching hall.  Wide steps hewn from silver-flecked marble provide both walkway and seating, leading down to a sunken dais in the center of the circle.  A thin ornamentally carved podium sits atop the dais, situated so that is easily viewed from anywhere within the circular hall."
