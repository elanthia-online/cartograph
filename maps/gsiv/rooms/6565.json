    "A sprawling bramble of red-berried nettle bushes has spread itself over much of the old kitchen garden.  A few resolute herbs still hold their own -- mint, chervil and a ragged patch of lavender next to the kitchen door.  A low wall divides the garden from a bower beyond, where fruit trees survive.  The wall is richly carved, its vine scrolls inset with hollow-eyed masks, a popular motif during the castle's heyday.  An arched corridor offers passage through the towering wall enclosing this inviting area."
