    "A thick blanket of reeds and marshy vegetation meanders alongside the river bank.  A thin pathway stamped out among the reeds climbs over a small rise to the east.  The high-pitched chirp of a frog echoes from within a stand of cattails that waves mockingly from the edge of the darkened water.",
