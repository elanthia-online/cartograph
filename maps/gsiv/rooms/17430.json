  "description": [
    "Dominated by an expansive four-poster bed draped by clouds of burgundy gauze, the cavernous suite has ample room for a sprawling circular table etched with a map of Elanith.  Stained crystal windows in the western wall spit shards of carmine and indigo light onto the red-veined black tiles underfoot.  Steps etched out of the marble travel up to a recessed archway in the northern wall, which houses a modest stone altar and accompanying statuary."
