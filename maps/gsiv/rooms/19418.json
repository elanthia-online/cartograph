    "A glass ceiling allows the sunlight to penetrate this small foyer.  The accumulation of ice and snow on the glass panes softens the illumination.  Large iron pipes in each corner run from floor to ceiling, gurgling and hissing with the sound of passing steam and radiating warmth into the room.  Colorful trails of arrows applied to the stone floor lead off in different directions.  Two unlit torches flank a large sign mounted on the wall.",
