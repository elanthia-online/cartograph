    "Shrubs, small trees and neatly bordered garden beds filled with a variety of plants and herbs are clustered about the garden, centered around sculptures of granite, sandstone and limestone.  At the heart of the park rests a bronze statue of an aged man with a thick tome open on his lap, a brass plaque set into a granite boulder at its feet."
