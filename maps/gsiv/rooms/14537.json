    "Lustrous, deep red rosewood trees reach toward the glass roof of the aviary.  Their trunks form a ring, screening this clearing from the trail leading down the cliff.  Cascades of vines snake among the trees, drooping down like snakes.  Showers of raindrops fall from above periodically as birds find new perches in the branches, making the jade green leaves sway and release the moisture."
