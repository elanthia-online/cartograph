    "Meandering by with sluggish gurgling, the brackish water is filled with a thick, reddish-black muddy sludge reminiscent of coagulated blood.  A slight current pulls the mire around black gum trees and further out into the swamp, cutting a swath of deep color across the water's surface.  Surrounded by golden trumpet pitcher plants, a small wooden slab sticks out of one of the more solid lumps of shoreline."
