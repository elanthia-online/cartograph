    "Situated to one side of the square rests the local tavern, from which sounds of talk and merriment drift at irregular intervals.  To one side of the stone structure is a metal grill, apparently used for the braising of the tavernkeep's edible offerings.  A silver-framed sign swings from the awning above the front door."
