    "Hugging the guild's walls, the path winds its way through a veritable a cornucopia of tropical blossoms.  Bright blossoms of blue and green mingle with their red and orange brethren, while complicated vines of flaeshorn berries tumble across the cinnamon bark-covered ground.  Strong fragrances fill the air and carry with them heady notes accented by a light sweetness."
