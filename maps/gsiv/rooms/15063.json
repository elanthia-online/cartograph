    "A set of wooden shelves hangs on one of the tool-lined mistwood walls, and a herb-strung beam ceiling rises overhead.  A collection of plant-filled flowerpots sits in one corner of a green-carpeted floor.  There is a glass-encased terrarium on one side of the shop and an overflowing flower basket on the other."
