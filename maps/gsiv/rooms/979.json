    "A herd of domesticated roltons occupies the field to the east.  The beasts huddle against the cold, some bleating loudly and moving about while others lie in the snow, apparently sleeping.  Loud sawing sounds seem to come from somewhere to the west, though the wind and blowing snow mix the sounds up and make it difficult to discern a direction.  The road bends here, moving off to the northwest and northeast.",

The beasts root about through the snow, bleating loudly and searching for edible grass blades as a pair of young dwarven lads keep watch over them.  Loud sawing sounds seem to come from somewhere to the west, though the wind and blowing snow mix the sounds up and make it difficult to discern a direction.  The road bends here, moving off to the northwest and northeast."
