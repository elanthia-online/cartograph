    "Torn, empty grain and rice sacks are strewn about the floor, their contents long since eaten by rodents.  A large stone fireplace takes up the western wall.  Inside the fireplace, a kettle hangs on a hook over long cold ashes, a ladle still inside.  A thick layer of dust covers the large wooden worktable in the center of the room."
