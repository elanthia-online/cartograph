    "A silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls, and an etched seaglass ceiling rises overhead.  A wooden ship's wheel sits in one corner of a swirled sea glass floor.  There is a long mistwood counter on one side of the shop and a silk-covered dress mannequin on the other."
