    "A length of gray cloth edged in dark blue has been hung between two tall monir trees, forming a makeshift shelter from the cool night air.  Festivalgoers, clustered in small groups and conversing quietly, laze about on the thick green grass, sheltered beneath the canopy.  Delicate glaesine globes dangle from small ironwork posts, casting their pale illumination in small circles."
