    "To the south, only the front and left walls of the building remain standing, the door open to the grasses that grow in the windbreak provided.  The building to the east has suffered in the elements as well, as the roof beams have fallen, blocking the doorway.  Rising above the beams are tall grasses, protected from grazing animals by the huge wooden forms they surround."
