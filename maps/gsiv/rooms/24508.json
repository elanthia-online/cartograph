    "From a small platform high up in the lor tree, stars twinkle like countless pinpricks across an endless ebon sky, the view stretching from mountains to endless wooded plains.  A pair of great horned owls swoop through the trees, hunting for prey, their melodic hoots echoing throughout the forest at a hypnotic tempo.  Carved on the silver tree trunk are some ancient runes.  A tightly-woven hemp ladder hangs over the edge of the platform."
