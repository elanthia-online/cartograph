  "description": [
    "Huge round columns stand in a ring in the center of the cavernous chamber.  The pillars, walls, ceiling and floor are all solid stone.  The walls are built of such massive slabs, the placing of them defies the imagination.  In the center of the ring of pillars rests an altar, its dark granite surface rough with deeply incised sigils.  Light shines up through the carved glyphs, casting eerie shadows that flicker across the ceiling in an endless dance."
