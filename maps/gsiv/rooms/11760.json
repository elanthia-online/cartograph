  "description": [
    "Moss hangs in matted clumps from the ancient boughs of the old cypress tree.  A set of ruined steps built into the trunk lead up to the ramshackled and abandoned building balanced between the branches.  A creaky sign sways in the marsh breezes, breaking through the silence of the fog."
