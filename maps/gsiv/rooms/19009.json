    "The room shifts and heaves, making it difficult to stay standing on the slick floor.  The walls, floor and ceiling contract and expand, stretching and then snapping back to form an irregular sphere.  The surfaces are mottled and hot, looking and feeling more like raw flesh than anything else.  Veins of glowing crimson liquid run down walls, under the surface, to enter a sucking wound in the center of the floor.  The liquid moves to the sound of a beating heart and barely illuminates the cramped chamber"
