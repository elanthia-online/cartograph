    "Sunbleached sailcloth walls billow in and out with every gust of wind, a salty seabreeze drifting in through an untied tent flap.  The hard-packed sand underfoot is littered with iridescent, broken shells and bits of smooth sea glass.  A piece of grey driftwood lays atop an empty wine barrel, a makeshift display table organized with vendibles."
