    "Sunlight filters through a large, glass-paned window, illuminating a tattered map spread out on a wooden table in the center of the cabin.  A logbook lies open on a straw bed near a wooden chair piled with freshly laundered garments.  Nautical charts are tacked to the oak-paneled walls, all scribbled with illegible handwriting, one drawn with a giant sea monster."
