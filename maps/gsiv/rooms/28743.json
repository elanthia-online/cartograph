    "This room is spacious and well lit, with smoothly hewn walls and a floor that can easily be scrubbed clean.  Folded cots line the walls, ready to be set up at a moment's notice to receive incoming wounded.  A spacious cabinet stands off to one side, directly next to a large work table covered with a swath of white linen.  Along the uppermost portion of the walls is a scrolling collection of images, depicting numerous stylized healing herbs intermingled with brightly colored, tropical birds."
