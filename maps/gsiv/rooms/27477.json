    "This section of the tent is bookended by curtains dividing the interior space.  One end sports a narrow gap leading to the front area, while opposite, a ragged slit that leads deeper into the tent.  The marbled canvas walls on either side are lined with narrow displays that house a variety of footwear, leaving a central aisle clear for walking.  A torch stuck into the dirt floor in each corner lends a flickering glow to the room, and illuminates the wares set up on the displays."
