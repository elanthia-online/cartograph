    "Sets of lit torches are placed in sconces about the room, lending light to the otherwise darkened, windowless room.  Splintered wooden treasure chests are piled up in the corners, their treasure yet to be revealed.  Along the far back wall a huge black skull-and-crossbones pirate flag is displayed, its edges roughly torn from abusive use.  Below the flag a colorful, one-eyed parrot is perched on a detailed ceiling sample display."
