    "A long, slowly rising slope leads up to a pack of small houses and a low stone wall huddled together against the weather.  Steps are cut into the ice, and a wooden rail has been set into the stairs to make the slippery climb easier.  Snow blows across the incline, dusting the steps frequently and more completely hiding the footfalls of previous travellers with each passing minute."
