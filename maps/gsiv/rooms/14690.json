    "Celadon marble walls rise from a dark-stained oak floor.  Just above a thin gold-edge black runner hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A vine-carved mahogany table and a Vornavian silk-lined display case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
