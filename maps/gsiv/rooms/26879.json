  "description": [
    "The narrow walls are painted in shades of midnight blue and stormy grey, the paler hues sweeping in spiraling arcs around a rectangular seascape painting at the back.  On opposite sides of the room, a dark-grained mistwood case and a carved white pine chest symmetrically mirror the position of a broad willow-planked hutch, each container illuminated by a solitary hanging silver lantern."
