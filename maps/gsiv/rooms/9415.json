    "The section of tunnel is brightly lit due to the type of toadstool in this area.  Very little coloration impedes the light flow as the toadstools project a light grey illumination upward and a soft white light downward.  The excellent illumination makes for easy travel, though the cleanliness and flatness of the floor makes footing not a concern.  An iron-lined opening leads into the office of the local constable, while a leather-covered door serves as the entry to a shop."
