    "This guestroom is modest but tasteful.  The walls are hung with several small tapestries depicting various Dhe'nar battles, and velvet curtains frame the glaes window.  A large bed with quilted covers and overstuffed pillows lies in the center of the room, with a matching nightstand sitting beside it."
