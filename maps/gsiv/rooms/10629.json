    "At the side of the river, silt-black soil supports the growth of black willow trees that whistle in a gentle breeze.  Trailing their long, thin branches into the water, the willows are also fed by the tiny streams that carry runoff from the tall ridge to the east.  As a result, the bottom land remains perpetually soggy, making travel through the area a messy and tiring proposition."
