    "[Sea N' Shore Room]"

  "description": [
    "Thick, speckled white-and-golden carpet stretches from wall to wall, much as the sand on the beach might stretch from horizon to horizon.  The ceiling is painted a soft sky blue with wispy white patches.  The sky blue color also extends down the walls, but turns slowly and subtly to a dark ocean blue a foot or so before it reaches the carpet.  Candles in brass holders light the room from each corner, illuminating the room's furniture, including a full replica ship's wheel mounted on the east wall."
