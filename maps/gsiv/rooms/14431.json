    "Scallop shell sconces created from translucent alabaster add little illumination to the small passage between the doorway and the main temple.  Wistful paintings of Niima, pictured both in humanoid form and as a figurehead on great sailing ships, border the walls just below the ceiling.  Streams of blue and green light inside bathe the nave just beyond the foyer."
