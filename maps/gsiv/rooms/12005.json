  "description": [
    "The aqueduct proceeds due east and west.  Rough-hewn, the sides of the aqueduct maintain their distance fairly evenly, although the ceiling appears to vary in height from place to place.  The floor is mostly level, with the odd rock here and there making for interesting footing.  The water's flickering green glow makes the light and shadows dance on the walls.  The rolling light effect makes the walls appear first to close in ominously, then retreat once again."
