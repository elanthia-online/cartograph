    "The facade of the castle, viewed from across this spacious forecourt, is impressive despite its derelict condition.  A finely fashioned doorcase stands over a broad course of steps, topped by a heraldic carving.  To either side, robust statues of crouched wolves stand guard.  Firing holes are noticeable on the sides of the doorframe.  Other doorways are spaced along the wings of the castle, which surround this inner ward in a protective embrace."
