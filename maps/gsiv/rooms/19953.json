    "Tall potted plants made of jade green silk rest in the corners of this quiet room.  Thick, dull gold carpeting muffles any footsteps of patrons perusing the items for sale that rest on numerous displays.  A glass-fronted oak cabinet rests against the wall opposite a long marble-topped counter, behind which stands a portly man in a woolen vest.  A stained golden oak door is centered between two additional potted plants, their vivid green silk leaves accenting the pale ivory hue of the walls."
