  "description": [
    "Several musty crates have been pushed to one corner and covered with a mold-ridden cloth.  Pockmarks and holes dot the walls, their interiors alive with the gurgle of hidden water flow.  The stone floor is blanketed by a thick layer of dust, interrupted only by the passage of unseen vermin.  Resting near the cave mouth is a wooden chest, its lid hanging by a single hinge.  A stone opening leads deeper into the cave, flanked on both sides by torches stuck into the floor."
