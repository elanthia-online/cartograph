    "The tunnel opens out into a roughly squarish chamber.  On the far wall, a mummified body is shackled upside down, arms and legs spread.  A post about as thick as your thumb and none too smooth is inserted in the mouth.  Judging by the nasty stains and calcified globs on the post and the floor around it, it probably continues a ways beyond the throat.  Positioned squarely in front of the figure is a towering dark stone monolith, shrouded in a thick mist."
