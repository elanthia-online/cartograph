    "This room has been decorated in bright, vivid colors.  The corrugated walls create variegated stripes, down which are painted some tiny gumdrops, lollipops, and lots of bright jelly beans.  A bent iron chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, covered with the wax of dozens of multicolored candles.  A large toy chest covered in scribblings sits against one wall beneath a stick figure drawing.  A small table sits near a splotchy dented door.  Beneath it stands a red wicker basket with a crumpled note stuck onto the handle.  A tall bookshelf supports containers of many shapes and sizes."
