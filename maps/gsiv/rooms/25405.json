  "description": [
    "Two tall Imperial soldiers stand on either side of a set of large wooden doors engraved with a simplified version of the crest of North Hendor.  A hallway leads westward, while the wide stairwell offers an avenue by which to return to the first floor.  Next to each guard is a banner, one showing the crest of the Earl of North Hendor and the other stitched with the name of the House Andrews."
