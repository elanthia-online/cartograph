    "A metal-topped counter occupies the central third of the platform, and a large sign hangs from the main post that rises behind the counter.  A ruddy-complected giantman, with shoulders and arms heavily muscled even for one of his race, leans on an oversized boarding pike, a polished glaes toothpick protruding from his mouth."
