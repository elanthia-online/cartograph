  "description": [
    "The slow ascent in the landscape is prevalent here as the dense jungle gives way to the gradual incline of a magnificent mountain.  Ethereal, overlaying mist inhibits a clear view, though the shrouded images of the massive formation are discernable to the scrutinizing eye.  The path of the river continues northwest despite the change in landscape, and glimpses of the foothills further north can be seen."
