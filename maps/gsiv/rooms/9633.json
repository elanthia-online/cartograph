    "The roots of cyclopean fel trees have forced some of the steps from their horizontal planes.  The great trees have grown over the smaller outbuildings of the temple complex, their trunks assuming fantastic shapes stolen from the stones they have covered.  Wide landings allow visitors to pause and admire the sight of the temple's conical towers reaching toward the stars."
