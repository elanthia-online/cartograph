    "Deep crevices running through the dusty surface of the road expose the multiple layers of clay topped with limestone slabs that successive generations of the ancient city's inhabitants used to repair this once busy thoroughfare.  A final layer of dirt, laid down by nature, tops the rest like thick icing on a cake."
