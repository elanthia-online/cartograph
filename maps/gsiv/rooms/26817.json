    "Lush green plants hang from the ceiling of this brightly painted room.  Rounded windows stretch the length of an entire wall giving an unobstructed view of the courtyard outside.  Wooden chairs etched in scrolling vine patterns sit around a carved wooden table.  A large pottery vase sits in the center of the glass surface, filled with lush moonflowers."
