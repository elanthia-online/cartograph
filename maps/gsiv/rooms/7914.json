    "A bronze replica of a forge, complete with hammer, tongs, and a blacksmith, resides along the back wall.  Supported by metal brackets in the ceiling, an intricately designed, fringed banner drapes down above the forge, and billows softly from a barely palpable breeze.  Hanging on the three remaining walls from sturdy wooden pegs, shiny metal bolts, and some thick metal rivets is a vast assortment of shields, polearms, and two-handed weapons, and protected behind thin sheets of glaes.  Brass flowerpots flank the sides of a wide staircase."
