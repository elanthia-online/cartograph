    "Arcing above, a massive dome covers the central chamber of the tent, its height held aloft by large poles of polished ironwood.  Bronze lanterns with etched panes hang from each post.  The tent walls ripple as the dark velvet is caught by a light wind from outside.  Built between two of the supports is an oblong table covered with a length of black silk."
