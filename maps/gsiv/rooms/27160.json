    "Bright firelight floods the area from no less than a dozen torches that hang from the rough oak walls in large wrought iron cages.  Scented rushes are thinly scattered across the floor and perfume the air with woodworm, hickory, and sage, the aroma nearly overpowering in the heat that falls off the surrounding walls in waves.  An oversized parchment map is stretched out upon the rooms only piece of furniture, which is a large knotted pine table."
