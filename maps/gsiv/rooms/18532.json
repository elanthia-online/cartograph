    "Warped and faded to grey, the raised decking is uneven and rickety.  A sagging awning shields the storefront from foul weather, though several patches attest to past inadequacies.  At the back of the porch, the store wall is set with a single door bracketed by two large windows.  Neatly lettered signs cover much of the wall's surface, often masking holes or gaps in the boards.  A wooden swing, suspended by iron chains, hangs at one end of the porch, while a cluster of rocking chairs sits at the opposite end."
