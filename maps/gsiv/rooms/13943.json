    "Stretched between ancient modwir trees, the ceiling is fashioned of a sturdy canvas and silk blend.  Permanent eastern and western walls support shelves and drying racks that house herbs, tinctures, and poultices alike, while a linden platform lifts the floor off the ground and is covered with lush rugs.  A set of steps leads down into a garden towards another canvas covered platform."
