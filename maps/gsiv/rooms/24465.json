    "The platform is uneven here, with segments of it covered in patches of greyish-white moss sluggishly eating away at the surface of the wood.  Countless leafy branches run like viridian veins above, beside, and beneath you, their sturdy forms serving as eager hosts to tendrils of curling vines.  Some large pegs holding colorful items protrude at odd angles from a low-hanging bough.  A faint scent of decaying organic matter reaches your nose.",
