    "A thick redwood tree, perhaps fifteen feet in diameter near the ground, extends only twenty-five feet or so up into the air.  Blackened and scarred, the trunk has snapped off, leaving a jagged, charred, lifeless spire.  Nearer the ground, though, the tree has sent out branches again, the dark grey needles indicating that, although the tree's outside is badly damaged, the heartwood is still healthy.  Like the proverbial phoenix, the redwood rises again from the ashes of the fire.",
