    "A strange orb in the center of the room glows softly, bathing everything in a fuzzy, ethereal light.  Shelves containing old potions, scrolls and mortars fill one wall.  Some barely discernable runes cover the opposite wall.  Next to the orb's pedestal a heavy table partially hides a large chest."
