  "description": [
    "Magnificent beneath a triad of jeweled domes, the plaza is a sprawling forest of crystal columns.  Inspired by the daylight streaming through massive stained glass windows spaced along the length of the plaza, the spires wax effulgent.  A raised marble dais visible at the northern end of the plaza supports an altar, laved from above by a circular shaft of sunlight.",
    "Magnificent beneath a triad of jeweled domes, the plaza is a sprawling forest of crystal columns.  Quickened by the moonlight streaming through massive stained glass windows spaced along the walls, the spires shimmer with a placid lambency.  A raised marble dais visible at the northern end of the plaza supports an altar bathed in wan moonlight."
