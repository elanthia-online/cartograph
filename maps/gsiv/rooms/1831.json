  "description": [
    "The trail wends its way among the towering trees, the worn groove of its delineation barely visible beneath the thick underbrush.  No light penetrates the canopy of boughs above, making it difficult to tell if it is day or night.  Rocks covered with the strange glowing lichen litter the ground beneath the trees."
