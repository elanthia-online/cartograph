    "The dining hall is full of shadows, lit only dimly by guttering candles.  Around the table sit nine skeletons, each holding a golden cup.  The undead seem to be chatting, drinking from their chalices only to have the liquid flow out and over their ribcages.  With a wave of disgust, you realize that the skeletons are drinking blood."
