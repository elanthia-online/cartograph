  "description": [
    "There is only a thin layer of leaves covering the mossy ground, as if the path had been cleared not too long ago.  Vines dangle helplessly from high branches, some nearly reaching the ground.  Oak leaves frequently spiral down from the trees, adding to the sheet of leaves on the forest floor.  Off to the west, there appears to be a break in the endless expanse of trees."
