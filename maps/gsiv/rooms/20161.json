    "The strong stench of burning wood permeates the air, and a deep layer of gray ash covers the floor completely.  Flames, fueled by a strong and unknown magic, blaze up and down along all four walls while thick black smoke clouds the ceiling above.  Scattered haphazardly throughout the shop are various sturdy rhimar chests displaying an assortment of shields within.  Easily discernable near the flames is a large rhimar case that also displays wares."
