  "description": [
    "Sequestered from the main garden, the orchard accommodates six black trees situated far from the edge of the platform and a tall wall of woven roots.  To the left of the nearly mature trees and in front of four rows of stakes, small black saplings splay out of the soil at peculiarly bent angles.  The tiny wispy white strands of light floating about the cavern and illuminating the panoramic view of Lich's Landing seem to avoid wandering anywhere near the orchard, effectively couching it in a perpetual crepuscule."
