    "The broad street continues east to west, wide enough to handle two passing wagons, but not much more.  Children run back and forth across the street from one boarded sidewalk to the next, leaping over an open sewage trench that runs lengthwise down the road.  A ramshackle wood storefront sits at the center of the street.",
