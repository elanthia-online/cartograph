    "[The Cozy Room]"

  "description": [
    "The room is painted a deep russet color, edged with polished oak around its shuttered window, floor and ceiling.  A large bed occupies most of this small area, barely leaving room for the bedside table and oak armoire situated against the opposite wall.  The linens on the bed and a small fur rug in deep green tones give the room a homey charm."
