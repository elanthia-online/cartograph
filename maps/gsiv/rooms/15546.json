    "Rich tapestries and gilded sconces mark the entrance to the Academy theatre, a place built specifically for storytelling and musical concerts.  Heavy curtains cover the entrance to the theatre, muffling outside noise.  To the north are the two classrooms, as evidenced by a steady flow of students walking to and from with books in hand."
