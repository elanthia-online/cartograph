    "The cobblestone pavers split into two paths, one veering to the north, as the rest continue in a circle to the southwest.  A series of lush, green, freshly trimmed topiaries in the shape of animals line the path leading north towards the massive castle.  Cresting the top of the topiaries is a small nest, long vacant of any avian."
