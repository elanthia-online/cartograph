    "A long, polished mahogany table surrounded by mismatched chairs dominates the room.  A huge pair of ornate ebony and brass candlesticks sits on the center of the table.  Smells of cooking food drift through the room from an old swinging door.  Two large portraits, one older than the other, of former residents gaze down from opposite walls."
