  "description": [
    "A narrow pool of ebon water bisects the library, an expansive room made more immense by the high, arched ceiling of dark crystal panes held in place by onyx and alabaster supports carved with symbols of the Arkati.  Tables and chairs cluster around the onyx-lined edges of the pool, and dozens of tall rosewood bookshelves overflowing with books fill the room.  The deep blue carpets are strewn with petals of lily, rose, and jasmine to add bright and fragrant counterpoints to the dark interior."
