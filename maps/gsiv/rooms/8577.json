  "description": [
    "You weave your way through the narrow spaces between a score or so of low mounds covered with sparse vegetation.  On closer inspection, you realize they are actually ancient mass graves, hastily dug and filled.  To the south, the refreshing meadow beckons.  To the north, the dark, vertical shapes take on the terrifying aspect of some unearthly bird poised for flight."
