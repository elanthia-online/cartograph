    "Here at the farthest end of the hall the fire is just a hazy glow, long shadows lie across the floor, and the smoke paws you like a drunken mercenary.  The dark figures bent together nearby sit here for just that reason and scowl at your approach as though they owned the sawdust under your boots.  They're an ugly lot."
