    "A parchment chart complete with examples of all available metals and stones for custom craftwork has been displayed prominently against the cavern wall.  Occasionally, one of the emporium's assistants will block off a material when it runs out of stock.  The cap of a nearby giant toadstool glows a soft white, illuminating every detail and flaw of the sample materials."
