  "description": [
    "Blood pours in from the corridor to the northeast.  Unlike the blood you are used to seeing, this blood is blue, the color of suffocation and death.  Indeed suffocation is a good metaphor, for the walls close in on you in regular constrictions, only to move back out and repeat the process.  The azure slime is forced southward, turning a deep violet as it moves."
