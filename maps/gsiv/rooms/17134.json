    "The silver sconces that line the chamber's walls at regular intervals are replicated in a mirror image on the surface of the highly polished black marble floor.  Snow white velvet blackwork curtains are drawn tight, effectively blocking all light from the small egg-shaped window behind them.  Cater-cornered to the ivory inlaid door stands an elaborately carved ebonwood desk set in the center of plush, layered blue carpets.  Stacks of ledgers and parchments are placed neatly atop a footstool near the table."
