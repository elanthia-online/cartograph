    "Bookcases line the walls of the room, mostly empty now.  Clearly the largest room in the villa, it is also the one where the destruction is most disturbing.  Thousands of scrolls and tomes have been slashed and burned, corners of burnt pages still visible among the ashes in the fireplace.  Broken pieces of pottery, shards of crystal and pieces of several unknown materials lie strewn among the remains of tomes and scrolls."
