    "Dark deposits coat the floor of the tunnel, slime and mold and other unnamable things that have taken root beneath the shallow run of water, making every inch crawled fraught with danger of slipping.  The fetid odor of rot is an undercurrent to the rising scent of stagnant sea water, and beyond the wan infusion of light, the sound of waves crashing can be heard."
