  "description": [
    "Patches of dewy clover dot the lush green lawn around the base of an ivy-covered tall stone tower, its pointed, conical roof rising toward the starlit sky.  Flickering candlelight illuminates the window at the tower's very top as it overlooks the courtyard.  A cobblestone path winds toward the garden, while a stone-framed lancet arch leads out through the curtain wall."
