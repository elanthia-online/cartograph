  "description": [
    "The lotus-shaped blossoms of water lilies bounce and bob on the surface of the pond, and several stepping stones lead down into the water.  A family of frolicking geese creates a cacophony of sound as they playfully swim around the pond nipping at each other.  A lone duck swims the circumference of a barrel, which is next to the entrance of a square cottage made of riverstone.  Towering over the cottage is an old birch tree, pieces of its papery-thin bark litter the ground.",
    "The lotus-shaped blossoms of water lilies dot the moon-streaked surface of the pond, and several stepping stones lead down into the water.  Towering over a square cottage made of riverstone is an old birch tree.  Pieces of its papery-thin bark litter the ground, and an assortment of red and blue trafel mushrooms grows at the base of its trunk."
