    "Taking up most of the room, a wide iron cage harbors a severely deformed thyril.  The bars of the cage are bent and twisted, as if the thyril has tried to escape from its prison.  An oily substance seeps out from the cage and into a puddle on the floor.  A large sign hanging over the cage reads, \"Thyril meen!  Claws sharp!  No pets!\""
