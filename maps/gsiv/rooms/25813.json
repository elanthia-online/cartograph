    "Towering trees rise from the loamy soil underfoot to form a verdant green canopy overhead.  A bright green parrot and vibrant blue macaw hop from perch to perch along the branches.  One of the larger trees, home to a group of birds, displays a remarkable amount of bird droppings along its trunk.  A wide stream of swiftly flowing water is visible through a stand of trees to the east."
