    "Ringed in cobblestones, the courtyard is a combination of carefully placed stones and sprawling lawns.  Spindle-limbed dogwoods and cherry trees dot the landscape, their bright pink and white blossoms catching the sunlight.  Upon the far end of the courtyard, a sprawling villa is nestled amid a verdant garden, while opposite an ornate gate leads to the streets of the city.",

Dappled with golden sunlight through the trees, a foliage-lined pebble path leads through the garden to the back of the building, while a glass-paned white birch door offers entrance through the front."
