    "A huge pile of bones slopes upward to the east, the dry white cascade hemmed in by rock formations to the north, south and west.  No rock floor presents itself, though, and the depth of the bones is indiscernible.  All types of bones litter the area, including skulls, femurs, tibias, ulnas, vertebrae, and other assorted bones from large bipedal creatures.  The size and shape of the bones are quite suggestive of trolls.  The rock face on the west wall has collapsed somewhat, revealing a wide crevice."
