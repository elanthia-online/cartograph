    "Passing merchants, laden with pelts of all shapes and sizes, trudge southeast towards Furryback's Pelt and Skin.  An earthen-worked cottage faces the street, the snow cleared from its front path.  The trilling sounds of a flute drift from the cottage's doorway.  To the east lie the sights and sounds of the Icemule Bazaar."
