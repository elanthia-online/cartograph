  "description": [
    "Splitting off from Tidewater Road just short of where the solid ground ends and South 'Haven's supporting wooden platform begins, a narrow causeway extends out into the Bay.  Polished brass railings supported by grey marble dolphins run the length of the isthmus, ending at the doors of a gold-spired limestone temple that stands above the waves half a cable's length out in the Bay."
