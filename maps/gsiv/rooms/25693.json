    "Perfumed with the scent of tropical blossoms, the damp air of the waterway is slightly chilly.  Choppy waves pass by as they make their way toward the beaches that form a solid line of sand to the northeast, while to the southwest, docks surrounded by bright red buoys bob up and down in a lazy manner."
