    "It is much colder in this small closet than it is in the rest of the ship.  The cooler temperature is likely a boon to the lush fur garments hanging from the long wooden racks which rest against two of the walls and the compartmented display hanging from a third.  A series of shallow copper troughs filled with ground charcoal run around the baseboards of the room underneath the racks.  Light filters in from the opaque paper-shaded window of the steel hatch, providing just enough brightness to illuminate the closet."
