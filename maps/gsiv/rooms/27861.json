    "The broad sweep of the blonde oak floor is interrupted by a woven Vornavian silk rug.  Halfway to the oak beam ceiling, a woven floral tapestry hangs on one of the smooth white plaster walls.  A floral-etched ceramic case and a plain wooden table are pushed close together in the back of the shop.",
    "Enclosed by smooth white plaster walls, the shop features a woven Vornavian silk rug in the center of its blonde oak floor.  A woven floral tapestry hangs under the oak beam ceiling.  Right near the front is a floral-etched ceramic case and a vine-carved mahogany table."
