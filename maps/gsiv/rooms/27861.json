    "The broad sweep of the blonde oak floor is interrupted by a woven Vornavian silk rug.  Halfway to the oak beam ceiling, a woven floral tapestry hangs on one of the smooth white plaster walls.  A floral-etched ceramic case and a plain wooden table are pushed close together in the back of the shop.",
