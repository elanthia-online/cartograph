    "Worn smooth by the passage of many grasping hands, the heavily-bound ropes of the bridge have withstood the rigors of time.  A low vibration moves through the woven cords, lending them the illusion of life.  However, it is the dull hum of the rushing water below and quick gusts of inconstant wind which truly send a shudder through the stretched and fraying twine."
