    "At the end of a severe twist of the corridor, the footing grows dangerously uncertain.  Fraught with ankle-breaking crevices and canted at an almost impassable decline, the way would discourage the most sure-footed of beasts or dwarves.  Within the walls to either side, the whisper of molten lava can be heard, rushing through its hidden course."
