    "The trees are more closely spaced here, clouding the surroundings with a predominantly dark evergreen hue interspersed with pale crimson and violet.  The noises of the city beyond the grounds are nearly nonexistent, their presence muted by the heavy boughs of the trees.  Nearly hidden among the foliage, a small house stands to the east, its dark-tiled roof glinting with faint light."
