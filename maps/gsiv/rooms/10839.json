  "description": [
    "Tucked into the space between the drawbridge and the bank is a small wooden structure nearly hidden from sight by cattails and tall river grasses.  Two pathways have been cut and beaten through the abundant riverside weeds, one to the west and another down to the Tempest itself, where a small dock sits causing swirling pools in the current.  The noise of the passing water is amplified by the bridge above, creating a heightened sense of the river and the wetness in the air about it."
