    "A series of large openings punctuate the rocky wall on the western side of the molten river.  Growing along the cavern floor, clusters of tall crystals shine with a translucent reddish hue, reflecting the lava's fiery glow.  A pair of sturdy glaes bridges span the massive fissure, leading to the rest of the guild."
