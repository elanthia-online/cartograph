    "Narrow as a closet and almost as dark, save for a lone oil lamp that emits a sooty wisp of smoke, the tiny office is as neat as possible thanks to several shelves stacked with piles of paper.  A small, battered desk has been pushed up against one wall and rests beneath a sign that simply says \"Deeds.\""
