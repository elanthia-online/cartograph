    "This square room seems to have been carved out of solid rock, as evidenced by the smooth, hard walls.  A simple, deep brown rug covers the center of the floor.  A mural has been painted on one wall, covering it from floor to ceiling with a detailed image of the Eye of V'Tull.  Two granite benches sit against the adjacent walls, and a refreshment cart stands in the corner.  A sign hangs over a carved stone stairway, and a rounded arch is carved in the fourth wall, nearly hidden by deep blue curtains."
