    "The opposite bank rises to form a narrow channel between it and the bluff.  The river pours swiftly through the channel as a deep black ribbon.  Just below, the river must be eating away at the bluff, for it is not possible to see the point where the river meets the bluff no matter how far one tries to stretch out over the edge.  It is an ominous indication that the edge might not be as sturdy as one would like to believe.",
