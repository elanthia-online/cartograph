  "description": [
    "The spiraling staircase ends evenly with the floor of the landing, next to a turned over column and a partially shattered bust lying on the ground.  A hallway extends to the west, past a row of narrow windows and a small table that provides the setting for a vase full of wilted flowers.  Dust swirls about in the columns of light that pour in from the windows, changing directions with every errant draft of wind."
