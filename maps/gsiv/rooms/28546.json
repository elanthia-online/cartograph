    "Bamboo poles, wedged into rocks, support an off-white canvas canopy that ripples and snaps in the ocean-borne breeze.  Fitfully burning torches rise along the edges of the small shop that consists of a single table fashioned of salvaged driftwood.  Dipping and rising, the uneven ground of black sands and large boulders descends towards a beach pockmarked with tidal pools.  To make passage between the shop and beach safer, someone has constructed a set of rough oak steps."
