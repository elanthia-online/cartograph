    "Cobblestones encircle a butterfly garden composed of a plethora of wild flowers and local flora.  The scent of the rich soil and the thriving plantlife is prominent, and butterflies of all hues and sizes flit to and fro in the sunlit garden.  Large trees frame the walkway, providing shade for a few benches set about for visitors."
