  "description": [
    "Dominating this chamber is a long oak table that stretches the length of the room.  Upon the table is an oil lamp which burns steadily.  An ancient oak chair sits on a small rise at the far end of the table, while several oaken chairs of various sizes surround the remaining perimeter.  Opposite the entrance, three tall windows show a moonlit, snowy landscape.  The oil lamp dimly illuminate several maps and charts that are hung with care upon the walls.  A giant stone archway is set in the wall behind the great chair."
