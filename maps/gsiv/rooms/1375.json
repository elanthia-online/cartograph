    "The trail forms a 'T' here, with the base of the 'T' stretching south.  One arm of the trail heads west, and the other heads east towards the river.  A dauntingly sheer face of rock rises just beyond the intersection, a shoulder of the mountain to the north shrugging itself free of trees and soil."
