    "Gnarled walls of unevenly hewed bark make up this small hole of a space in the banyan's interior.  Despite the cramped quarters, air flows freely through small slats in the wood, bringing with it the scents and sounds of the jungle.  Small dewdrop-shaped lanterns of glass hang from above, illuminating the delicate branch-woven furnishings and vine-wrapped sign."
