    "Hissing and sputtering comes from a torch, while flaming bits of its meager fuel drip to the ground, where they immediately are extinguished in a puddle of water.  Beside the torch is an iron door which hangs from a broken hinge, allowing barely enough space for passage into the cell beyond.  The skeletal remains of a hand, stained yellow and covered with dust and cobwebs, lies nearby."
