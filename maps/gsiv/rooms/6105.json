    "Cramped walls of cavernous earth stretch out before you, a natural incline leading deeper down into the darkness.  Small bits of colorful coral are placed decoratively on ledges of rock, adding splashes of color to the rather mute grey surroundings.  The air is thick with the pungent smell of sea-salt, and small drops of condensation trail softly along the walls giving them a glistening sheen."
