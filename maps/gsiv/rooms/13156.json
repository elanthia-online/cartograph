    "Relics from the founding of the First Legion of Khazar are exhibited in this chamber, set neatly upon simple stone pedestals.  Several historical tapestries hang upon the plain white walls, along with a large vivid portrait.  The displays are softly illuminated by giant luminescent toadstools set into the corners of the room.  Propped up on a sturdy glaes stand is an immense granite tablet that has been engraved with all known names of members of the First Legion."
