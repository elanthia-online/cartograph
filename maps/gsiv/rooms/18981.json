    "Slivers of azurite crystal have been inlaid into a dizzying spiral pattern upon the cold stone floor.  The slightly arched ceiling has been carved with a swirling design that faintly resembles flowing runes.  Against the western wall, a set of onyx-inlaid doors are flanked by two recessed alcoves that house stairways leading to the lower level."
