    "Most of the back wall of the lobby is comprised of a detailed raised mural done in bold colors.  Soft chimes emit from the crystal prisms of the chandelier hanging overhead as it slowly rotates on its chain.  High-backed chairs encircle a silver serving cart containing both hot and cold drinks and a few snacks.  Strange symbols border the edges of arched openings located at both ends of the hall.  At the back of the rectangular chamber, an ivory inlaid door stands ajar."
