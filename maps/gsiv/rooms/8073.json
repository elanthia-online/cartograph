    "Enough moonlight leaks in to make the outermost portion of the cave hazily visible.  A couple of rusted torch-holders are bolted to the walls, and fantastical petroglyphs adorn most of the surfaces.  The ground is hardpacked soil and surprisingly flat.  The depth of the cave disappears in darkness, though a small crevice can be seen just where the blackness usurps the remaining light.",
