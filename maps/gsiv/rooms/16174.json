    "A well-beaten sandy path is surrounded on both sides by overbearing brambles which block out all but the night sky above.  Heard, but not seen, a river flows loudly to the north with a constant low roar.  The dark shadow of a small stone bluff rises to the east, and numerous men and women arrive through and disappear into a large black crevice.",
