    "The front room of the residence is modest, with a hearth along one wall, windows along another, and a half-circle of leather-backed chairs facing a woven blue area rug.  Above the fireplace hangs a shield bearing the DeArchon family crest and a pair of crossed silver stilettos with ornate handles."
