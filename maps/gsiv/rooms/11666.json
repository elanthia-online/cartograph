    "A deep layer of mud covers what must have once been a dirt walkway leading between a collection of decrepit shanties and shacks constructed from planks of weathered wood.  The doorways to the structures have all been battered and broken.  Fog drifts among the structures like ghosts.  To the southwest the path wends between a pair of oddly-shaped hummocks."
