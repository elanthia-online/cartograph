    "Mead Tunnel Walk is rendered aromatic with the smell of mead wafting from a brewery, which is obviously located somewhere nearby.  A few doors find a home in the walls, their owners undoubtedly fond of the drink.  Halflings who pass occasionally sniff the air with appreciation and nod, as if judging the quality of the air to be satisfactory."
