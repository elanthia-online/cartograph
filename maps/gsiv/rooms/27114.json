    "Reaching over the tufted grass clearing, an enormous banyan tree offers a shady respite for a sleepy tortoise.  Centered in the surrounding vegetation, the banyan tree's roots bow outward creating a small, dark hollow.  Reflecting the bright sunlight, bleached bones stand out against the verdant grass and beige topsoil.  Adding a small splash of color, a single fiery red lily rises up from the pile of bones."
