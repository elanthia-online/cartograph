    "A steady patronage frequents a nearby building, undoubtedly a bakery judging from the fragrant scents emanating from within.  Several beds bursting with rosemary, lavender, thyme, and other herbs frame the shop's cobblestoned walk.",
    "Twin smokestacks protrude from the top of a long, low building.  Around their outputs, the marble that makes up the building's cladding is tinged a dirty grey, off from the overall white.  A further grey on the building is a deep shadow, cast from the shape of a floating dais raised over the roofline.",
