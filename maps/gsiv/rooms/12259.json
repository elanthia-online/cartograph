  "description": [
    "It is dark and cozy inside the trunk of the tree, the curving wooden walls provide a feeling of warm security against the dangers of the night.  A thick growth of moss has crept within the trunk, forming a soft, spongy carpet the entire length of the hollow space.  An opening at the end of the trunk leads out to the woods."
