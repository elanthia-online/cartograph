    "The citadel wall to the south darkens the area, stunting the growth of the deciduous trees in this part of the garden.  Their leaves, now fallen, create a soft humus that softens your footsteps.  While not as cold or as dark as the area to the west, the fall-like chill here is enough to cause you to want to move on."
