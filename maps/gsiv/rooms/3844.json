    "Bleached white oak floorboards spread across from one end of the small receiving room to the other, the smooth expanse topped with a braided rug of cobalt blue and bright red linen.  Scattered furnishings, that of a driftwood cabinet near the open front door and a pair of matching sofas, face an enormous fireplace crafted of sturdy granite stones and topped with a simple mantle of rough driftwood.  A nearby open window allows the fragrances of the front yard to trickle in, while also cooling the warm room."
