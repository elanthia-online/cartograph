    "Slick rocks constantly moistened by the splashing river provide the only means of travel to the west.  Above, the bluff trail is impassable, the river's assault having torn it down into the rushing waters.  Below, the river is littered with stones and tree trunks of varying sizes.  The only things keeping the river from claiming more of the land are the thick forest roots and the sheer volume of rocky material.  It is likely that these will also eventually succumb to the river's territorial demands."
