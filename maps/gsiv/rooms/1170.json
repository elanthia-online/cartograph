    "Beavers have constructed a dam in a shallow spur of the river below.  The dam, in turn, has created a large pool behind it to facilitate the growth of pond weeds, a favorite beaver food.  A pair of beavers move about in the pool and on the shore, carrying sticks in their mouths to add to the dam, diving into the pool to feed, or dipping down to perhaps inspect the sturdiness of their efforts or enter their lair for a rest.  A box turtle sleeps on a nearby rock, oblivious to the splashing beavers.",
