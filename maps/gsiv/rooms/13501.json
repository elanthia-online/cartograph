    "The elevation of the cliff offers a panoramic view of the lake, with the mist-cloaked castle hulking at the far end and a pencil thin tower rising out of thick fog to the north.  Oaks dominate the ridge, with pine trees tucked around the feet of the taller trees with their lacy foliage of needles.  The scent emanating from cottage hearths mixes with the aroma from the pines in a fresh, spicy perfume."
