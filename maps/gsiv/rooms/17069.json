    "Thick wood timbers support the walls of the round circular chamber and are each decorated with a brightly burning torch in a sconce.  Multiple shelves line the walls, bowing underneath the weight of dozens of jars and containers.  A polished slate table sits in the center of the room laden with several stone mortars."
