    "A large brass crab hangs on the nearest wall of this small, cramped booth, its pinchers raised menacingly toward some unseen enemy.  A variety of crude carvings border the table haphazardly in a vain attempt to imitate the crustacean, though it's quite obvious the artist was lacking in talent.  A small oil lamp hangs upon the low ceiling, imparting a sense of intimacy in the small booth."
