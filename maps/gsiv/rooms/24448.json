    "The din of the open warehouse is muffled by several mammoth hides draped against the walls, the giant layers set behind a long wooden counter, preventing access to the public.  A riveted wooden platform sits towards one end of the counter, loaded with twine-tied bundles of fabric, neatly stacked and labeled."
