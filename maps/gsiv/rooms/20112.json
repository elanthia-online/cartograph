    "[Abandoned Shack]"

  "description": [
    "Three walls and a roof make up the excuse for a shack that leans against a large bald cypress tree with branches and roots heavily encroaching on the structure.  It appears as though something is slowly eating away at the walls, and the roof is in such disrepair that it has fallen in on itself.  There is no sign of any furniture.  Given its current state, the building is likely not very old, and it is also likely not to last too many more years into the future."
