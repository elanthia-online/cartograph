  "description": [
    "A large courtyard overlooks Stonestep Clinch.  On the plaza's north edge, a low granite wall serves as the only boundary preventing a plunge down into the dark water of River Ne'Halin.  A mosaic inset with colorful stones covers the courtyard's floor, depicting an intricate pattern of knot-work that circles a central spiral.  A full yellow moon sits in the nucleus of the design, reigning proudly in its own firmament of tiny stones."
