  "description": [
    "Far enough from the road to bring the respite of silence, this wooded glade is peaceful and serene.  A gently rippled pond provides fresh water for the forest dwellers, their hoof and paw prints leading to and from the water's edge.  Fallen logs, half-submerged along the shoreline, grant a safe sunning spot for yellow-bellied terrapins and a few spotted lizards."
