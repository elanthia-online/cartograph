    "Elevated just above the main boutique floor, this spacious atelier beholds the beauty of its arboreal environment.  Partially finished designs inspired by the stunning backdrop are suspended from a network of cords high above.  A stand of posed mannequins have been clothed in completed outfits beside a crowded sewing table."
