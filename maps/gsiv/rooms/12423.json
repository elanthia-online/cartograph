    "Along the walls, columns carved out of the grey stone reach from floor to ceiling.  Thin white lines painted on the columns give them the illusion of solid marble.  The tops of the columns are shaped like stylized palm leaves, fanning outward to reach toward one another across the ceiling of the corridor."
