  "description": [
    "Occupying the lee of the island, the black sand of the beach glistens in the silvery moonlight that trickles through the clouds above.  Protected from the harsh winds that course across most of the island by a high barrier of rocks, the quiet of the beach is occasionally broken by the cry of a gull."
