    "The walls are heavily laden with glowing blazestars of every known color reaching from roof to an unknown depth of the pool.  The waters, while still, are fantastically pure and reflect the light of the many sparkling gemstones.  Carved amongst them in the stone wall are recognizable hand holds leading to a solitary ledge.  On the far end of the caverns you see some flat rocks."
