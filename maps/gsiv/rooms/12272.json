    "The path continues in northerly and southerly directions here, past moss-covered trees on either side growing in the sandy soil.  A small thicket of bushes grows off to one side of the pathway, laden with bright red berries and sharp-looking thorns.  The branches rustle slightly as some animal braves the prickly barrier to make a meal out of the red fruit.",
    "A swarm of fireflies has made a home here and light this section of the path quite well.  The path continues in northerly and southerly directions, past trees on either side.  A small thicket of bushes grows off to one side of the path, laden with some type of berries and sharp-looking thorns.  The branches rustle slightly as some animal braves the prickly barrier to make a meal out of the red fruit."
