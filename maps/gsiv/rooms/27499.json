    "This generously sized triangular room's walls and ceiling have been fashioned with fabric in colors so pale they are difficult to identify.  Strings of tiny silver lights cover the ceiling, highlighting the shining, golden moon and stars appliques that cling to the walls in haphazard patterns.  A faint but sweet scent of powder seems to fade the longer you stay in the room.  In the far corner of the room stands a life-sized stuffed giraffe next to a white-washed wooden rocking chair."
