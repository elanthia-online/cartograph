    "Many caravans have stopped here, taking advantage of the stream gurgling westward across the trail.  A blackened ring of stones is surrounded by a larger circle of flat rocks used as seats by the drivers and guards.  The ground where oxen have trampled the grass shows signs of recovery from its ill treatment, and the overgrown ruts of a long-abandoned road are just visible among the tall grasses leading eastward."
