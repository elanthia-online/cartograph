    "Burning staunchly, torches light the hard stone floor and walls.  The stink of sweat clouds the hallway, though its origin is unidentified.  Drifting in from further down the hallway, a quick breeze lightly kisses the air, doing little to blow the heavy stench away.  A set of shackles hangs from a hook on the wall next to a door that, unlike the other barred doors lining the hallway, is constructed solely from solid wood."
