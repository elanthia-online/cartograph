  "description": [
    "The musty interior of the shack smells like a combination of freshly cut wood and old glue.  Rows of yew shelving piled high with various wares line the otherwise bare walls.  A thick ironwood door pockmarked by years of being used for target practice leads to a tiny workroom.  Sitting next to the door is a small mesille stand."
