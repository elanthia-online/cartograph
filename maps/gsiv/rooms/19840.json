    "A wide, mosaic-tiled pool of water holds court in the center of the garden, the gentle babbling from the fountain that rises from its center breaking up the reverent silence that permeates the clearing.  A circle of wide marble columns rings the expanse, each one holding aloft the stone likeness of a Liabo Arkati.  Viridian leaves frame pale white moonflowers that edge the pool, mimicking the color of the plush, pristine white prayer mats that are carefully placed around the grounds."
