    "The hallway ends in a small cul-de-sac that features a gold-framed painting, its exterior well-lit by a grouping of tall crimson candles.  A small arched door stands to the north, its well-polished surface chased with curls of lustrous silver.  A circle of large bay windows allows one to gaze out upon the cityscape, each window's cozy nook supplemented with dark velvet pillows."
