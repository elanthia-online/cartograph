    "[A Silent Path, Gateway]"

  "description": [
    "To the northwest, a meadow stretches out like a soft carpet of tall waving grass and flowers, while the eastern turn of the path is well-tended and lined with yew hedges braced by a striking iron and stone gate.  A monk wanders by, his lips moving in silent prayer as he strolls along the creek following the path."
