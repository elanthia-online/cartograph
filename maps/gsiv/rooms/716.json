    "A small guardhouse stands in the lee of the city's tall, protective wall.  Thrown into shadow by the dominating bulk of BriarStone Keep just up the hill, the building is connected to the rest of the city by a steeply winding walkway, complete with switchback.  Several lit lanterns line the path.",
