    "The canvas ceiling is high overhead, and a series of bright banners descend down in gentle arcs, tying in at the top of each of the tent's walls.  A series of ornamental displays line the walls, and directly in the center of this area is a badly-damaged suit of armor set upon a pedestal, with a simple brass plaque at its feet."
