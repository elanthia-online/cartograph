    "A vast spidersilk web sprawls out as far as the eye can see.  Millions of tiny spiders strengthen their craft, allowing the surface to be durable enough to walk on.  The bright sunlight is nearly unbearable from all the way up here.  Below, the only thing recognizable is Mount Aenatumgana's peak.  There is a thick rope of spidersilk leading toward Elanthia off one of the web's edges.A vast spidersilk web sprawls out as far as the eye can see.
