    "A small, boggy clearing appears in the midst of the twisted trees and rotting stumps.  Low mounds covered with brownish moss rise out of the fog-enshrouded slough.  Hundreds of small snail shells lie in the muck that surrounds the mounds.  The faint moonlight gives the fog a cool, deathlike tint."
