    "Surrounded by a boulder garden of rough stones, an ancient dragon blood tree dominates the garden and provides shelter from the heavy, arid heat produced by the drakar rafters above.  Dozens of blue-flame agave plants grow just beyond the tree's shadow and under the bright glow of a decorative copper sun that is suspended high in the air.  Protected by a triangular glass enclosure, several thorny lizards bask in the heat from their perch upon various smooth stones."
