  "description": [
    "A jagged glacier looms over an open grassy knoll kissed with glistening frost and bordered by a dense coniferous forest capped in a thick layer of pure white snow.  The fresh scent of pine wafts on a chilled breeze as the surrounding trees sway, their snowy canopy bending to reveal a star-spangled sky.  Several makeshift log benches have been placed around a circular firepit, a crate of wood set into the snowy ground just beside it."
