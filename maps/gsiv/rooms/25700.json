    "Moonlight glitters off of the smooth, round surface of the globes that are strung in a straight line that creates a barrier between the open harbor and the swimming area beyond.  Dark blue waters slosh over the tops of the glass objects, causing random pieces to occasionally slip beneath the surface."
