    "Two windows, high above a small display case, are set into the far wall, their panels providing adequate sunlight which brightens the room.  The glow from silver candlebras complements the natural light from outside.  A half-circle bar occupies one corner near a few comfortable sofas.  In the center of the room is an oval forest green rug, surrounded by broad russet leather chairs.  An ivory-handled door serves as the exit, flanked by tall wooden bookcases."
