  "description": [
    "Tucked beneath a dense canopy of willow branches and leaves, this small, but cozy dome-shaped dwelling serves as a home for one or two families.  Straw-stuffed cots and petite canvas sacks filled with duck feathers are neatly arranged on one side of this circular room, and a stone stove displays some long-handled copper pots, white steam coiling upward from their boiling contents.  Locked in conversation, a young gnomish couple sits at a simple oak table, oblivious to your presence."
