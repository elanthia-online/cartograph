  "description": [
    "This intersection links the bazaar routes with those bisecting and encircling the Landing.  A few ruddyfaced sailors, loudmouthed dockworkers, and off-duty soldiers linger along the wall of a tavern, which is set back from the side of the road up a slight incline.  A shaky wooden stairway, the bane of many an overimbiber's existence, leads up to the tavern door."
