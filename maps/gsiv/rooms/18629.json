  "description": [
    "Statues carved from dazzling coral decorate the walls of the room, each one in the likeness of a god or goddess of Liabo.  Pearls, abalone and seashells shine out from between each statue, while a large shelf of varicolored coral serves as an altar.  A flame burns behind a thick blue glass lantern, washing the room in dancing ocean-colored light."
