    "A recent collapse on the other side of the gorge from here brings your attention to the severe undercutting of the edge.  Spotting the dented breastplate hanging from a jutting rock far below makes you shy away from the edge, in dismay.  The path you travel continues both southwest and northeast, along the edge of the gorge."
