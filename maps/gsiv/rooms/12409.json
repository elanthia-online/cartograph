  "description": [
    "The street is more a shallow mud pool than a road, and it's lined on either side by beat-up old shacks.  They lean against one another for support.  Sitting on her front stoop, an aging, stringy-haired halfling regards you with a grin and a wink.  At her feet crawls a grandchild, or perhaps a great-grandchild, tittering with toddler glee as he tugs on her foot-hair."
