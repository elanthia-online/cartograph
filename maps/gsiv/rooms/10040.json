    "A crude grey limestone arch stands before the entrance to the ancient barrow, leading north into a narrow passage of free-standing slabs of weatherworn stone.  The chill wind blows strong here, its stream directed by the looming form of the barrow mound, and swirls of mist and dead black leaves dance across the dark road."
