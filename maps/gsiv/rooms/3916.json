    "The tunnel threads its way through a series of rock columns.  Each is carved in the image of a tree trunk, with finely rendered bark, branches and an impossibly complex pattern of leaves overhead.  A couple of boughs on a nearby tree drop down in graceful curves, revealing their finery of leaves like a masterful dancer."
