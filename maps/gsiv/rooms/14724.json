    "[Twin Canyons, Outcrop Chamber]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Several large cracks in the outcrop intersect here, forming a very large chamber that opens to the sky like a chimney allowing a small circle of the silvery night sky to be seen.  Chattering noises seem to be coming from the walls of the chamber, which are heavily set with shadows and deep cracks.  Warm air and wisps of steam wafting up from cracks in the floor make this area comfortably warm while piles of refuse litter the floor making it obvious something lives here.",
