    "A pleasant little brook cuts across the faint path that leads down a sharp slope from the north.  Moving swiftly down the incline, the crystal clear water splashes against the rocky bed and gurgles into shallow pools.  The brook is narrow enough for even the shortest halfling to cross with ease, were it not for the impassable stand of privet that blocks further travel in that direction.",
