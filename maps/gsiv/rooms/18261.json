    "Cracked and peeling paint decorate the walls of the small shop, their curled ends littering the rough floor amid a layer of scattered sawdust.  One long counter stretches across the room, easily dividing the shopping space from the work area.  Implements of the butchering trade, such as razor strops, black iron rib cutters, and knives, dangle from black iron hooks, which stand over sanguine filled buckets."
