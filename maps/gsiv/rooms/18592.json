    "A beautiful oil painting of an intricately designed water fountain dominates the wall near this table.  Depicted in the portrait are three females, obviously of Elven heritage, standing back to back with their arms upraised.  A lightning bolt arcs from the fingertips of each female and connects high in the air, where the water plummets and cascades down into the base of the fountain below."
