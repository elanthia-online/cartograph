    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a vibrant pink bougainvillea plant.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, an oil-filled gold sconce hangs on one of the plain walls.  A silk-covered dress mannequin and a set of carved felwood shelves are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
