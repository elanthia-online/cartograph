    "Engraved brass oil lamps shed dim light and do nothing to offset the austerity of grey stone walls and thin reed mats.  Sharp pebbles are strewn across the floor, making kneeling a painful proposition, though perhaps that is the point.  A solitary window provides little distraction and gives a view only of the limitless gulf of the night sky.  The air seems unaccountably chilly.",
