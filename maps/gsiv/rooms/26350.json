  "description": [
    "The vast barracks kitchen houses a number of cast-iron pots, each bubbling with a mixture of meat, blood, and ligaments.  Stoves line a far wall, where the bodies of halflings and gnomes have been skewered on a spit and spin to a slow roast.  Skeletal cooks stand at a row of worktables, chopping up meat with butcher knives and tossing them into the pots."
