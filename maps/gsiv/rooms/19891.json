    "Sconces line the walls of the rectangular, granite-floored room, each set upon a narrow marble column that reaches up and supports a high ceiling.  A large torn banner is draped down one wall and set behind a simple black marble altar placed in the center of the room.  Five narrow archways, draped with dark red velvet curtains, lead off from the chamber into adjacent rooms."
