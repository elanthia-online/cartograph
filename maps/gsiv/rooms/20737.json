    "Lit by a single candle that rests atop each of several tables, the room is dim and wreathed in a thin veil of smoke that obscures the darkened corners.  A plush burgundy rug covers the hardwood floor and muffles the sounds of footfalls.  Scattered atop the rug are a few grey velvet settees, each one paired with a carved mahogany end table.  On one side of the room, a carved pine door leads out into the hallway, while opposite, a polished satinwood archway offers entry to the bar."
