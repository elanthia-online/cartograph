    "Unadorned, pristine white walls provide a striking background against the polished teak floor.  Tall, whitewashed cabinets stenciled in pastel colors depicting fresh healing herbs provide ample space to store all manners of supplies.  Adjacent to the entrance there is a large dust bin, surrounded by a subtle layer of fine brownish powder."
