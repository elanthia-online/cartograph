    "The scents of leather and oil welcome you, and a large curtained window on the northwest wall allows sunlight to spill across the comfortable bed directly opposite you.  Racks of weapons and armor line the southeast wall, silently proclaiming the owner's profession.  A table and two chairs provide a work area, and a wide windowseat easily accommodates some potted plants with enough room to seat five people."
