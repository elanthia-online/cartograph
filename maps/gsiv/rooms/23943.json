  "description": [
    "A multi-hued handwoven rug spans the distance between the entrance and the back of the wagon, which is rather short considering the modest stature of this wagon.  The light hue of the golden oak walls makes the space seem larger than it is, as does the tidy arrangement of tables on the perimeter.  On one table is a green-tinged smooth glass dish and a leaf-carved grey wooden platter, above which hangs a green willow-framed mirror.  Across the way, a stout pickle barrel rests beneath a set of green metal shelves secured to the wall by sculpted brackets.",
    "Jewel-toned satin hangs along the walls in sweeping scallops in this front room of the wagon, and each peak between is accented by a masquerade mask adorned with ribbons.  Scattered around are several display stands of varying heights, and from overhead, a many-limbed chandelier illuminates the interior as tiny flames flicker behind the cut glass shades on each arm."
