    "A ring of towering conifers grows out of the snow-covered, frozen ground.  In the center, a broad stone-ringed firepit is surrounded by several carved stone benches.  The starlit sky possesses a clarity only realized in thin, frigid mountain air.  The peddler Zakabie stands near a small cart with an oiled canvas canopy."
