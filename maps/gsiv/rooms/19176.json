    "Seeing the wares for sale this room is truly difficult, as the only light source is a pair of guttering oil lamps mounted on opposite walls of the closet-like space.  A stack of crates, nailed shut, are stacked haphazardly in the corner and covered in dust and cobwebs.  An open box is on its side in the middle of the room, with some contents peeking out of the torn flaps.  A rickety old ladder is used as a makeshift clothing rack."
