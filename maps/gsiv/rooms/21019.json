  "description": [
    "Constant rain and moisture have worn away the floor, allowing mud to flow freely through the area and down the slope to the west.  The thick, sticky covering makes it difficult to walk and gives off a foul scent.  Misshapen roots mingle and intertwine above ground, creating a series of archways and short tunnels to walk through.  Several clusters of tiny bell-capped mushrooms dot the terrain, and large black flies swarm about."
