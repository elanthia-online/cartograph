    "A barely visible, broken cobbled path winds its way through the dense forest under the ever-watchful gaze of ancient, black oak trees.  The wild scent of the shadowed woods hangs heavy in the air and a rustling of leaves or the instinctual clawing of some small woodland creature echoes amongst the trees.  An odd carven symbol hangs from a low-hanging branch.",
