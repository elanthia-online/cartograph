  "description": [
    "This section of the crenellated parapet is in relatively good condition, unlike most other areas of this once proud fortress.  Inverted keyhole embrasures, evenly spaced along the western battlements, stand guard over the immense forest that looms just on the other side of the wall.  Loose bits of stone and debris crunch underfoot with the slightest movement."
