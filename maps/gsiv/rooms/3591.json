    "Within the hush of the alcove, the still atmosphere hangs heavily, cloaked with dust and shadows.  Nothing is present in the way of furnishings, only a panorama of carved walls to ornament the quiet ambiance.  The ceiling is high above, reaching up into the darkness beyond reach of what little light penetrates the chamber from the hallway outside."
