    "The trail, coming from the northwest, confronts a sheer cliff.  Peering up into the darkness reveals little about the upper cliff edge, except for perhaps a glimpse of a shadowy tree root or two.  A huge boulder shores up part of the cliff, and the prickly brambles and sharp rocks restrict movement along the cliff face to a few feet in either direction.",
