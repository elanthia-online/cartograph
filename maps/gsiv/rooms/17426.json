    "Bathed by starlight winking in through a crystal dome in the ceiling, the procession of golden-veined marble stairs is supported by a thin frame that makes it seem suspended in air between a tremendous window in the northeastern wall and a fountain with a glass basin that rings the opposing.  The window looks out on the dark corner where Murre and Eider meet, while the basin is filled with life: numerous koi flicking through its depths like falling gold and silver coins."
