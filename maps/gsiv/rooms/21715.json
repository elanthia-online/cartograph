    "This uppermost portion of the tower shows very little deterioration, and the battlements around its circumference remain intact.  The expansive forest to the north has nearly reached the base of the wall sixty feet below you.  To the south lie the cathedral and the skeletal remains of the keep.  A trapdoor leads back down into the depths of the tower."
