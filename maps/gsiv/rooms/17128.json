  "description": [
    "The shed is fairly dark, except for the faint light that bursts inside through the gaps between the oaken boards.  A heady smell of decaying wood, coupled with persistently floating sawdust make lingering inside a less than pleasant proposition.  Stacks of raw wood in various stages of processing are arranged in stacks of various heights and organized according to their basic shapes.",
    "Dark, except for the faint moonlight that streaks inside through the gaps between the oaken boards, this structure offers no comfort other than the heady smell of decaying wood.  Stacks of raw wood in various stages of processing are arranged in stacks of various heights and organized according to their shapes."
