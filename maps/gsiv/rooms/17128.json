    "The shed is fairly dark, except for the faint light that bursts inside through the gaps between the oaken boards.  A heady smell of decaying wood, coupled with persistently floating sawdust make lingering inside a less than pleasant proposition.  Stacks of raw wood in various stages of processing are arranged in stacks of various heights and organized according to their basic shapes.",
