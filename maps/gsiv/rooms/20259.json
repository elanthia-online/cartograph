    "The rear quarter of the wagon has been sectioned off by a crimson velvet drape to provide a cramped private space.  Across the floor is a sprawl of pillows of all shapes and colors.  Amidst the pillows is a small round wooden table beset by squat wooden stools.  Moonlight streams in through a stained-glass skylight in the wagon's ceiling, bathing the area in a dim multicolored glow."
