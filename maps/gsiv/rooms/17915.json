  "description": [
    "Shouts echo within this enormous cavern, though the exact sources are unknown due to the pervading darkness that overpowers the illumination of resident luminescent moss and fungi.  The shadows here have no discernable edges, they merely blend with each other to create varying degrees of dark.  A few of the surrounding stalagmites have been hewn to create stone stumps for seating."
