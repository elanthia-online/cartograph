    "The marble walkway leads southwest and southeast underneath a thick walnut lattice apparently used by those moving about the second floor.  At the northern tip where the walkway comes to a point, a carved walnut door allows entrance to one of The Legendary Rest's sleeping rooms.  On the other side of the walkway, a honeysuckle hedge separates the walkway from the courtyard, though it is easy to see the courtyard's magnificent fountain from this vantage."
