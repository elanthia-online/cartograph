    "Several crossed wooden poles positioned together offer support to the structure.  A series of hooks hang from the ceiling, each with local creatures splayed and gutted.  Bleached by the sun, a wide wooden rack displays assorted clothing items.  Cresting the way back out is a massive bear head affixed to a wooden plaque."
