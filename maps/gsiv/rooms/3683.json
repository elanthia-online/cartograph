    "A massive arched ceiling lifts up from a circular floor splitting from four arches to eight as they curve into the wide dome.  Each section is dominated by a spectacular stained glass depiction of a Lord of Liabo.  At the ceiling's apex a huge transparent crystal forms the capstone.  Along with windows of transparent crystal encircling the room, it emits a soft relaxing light which seems to caress everything with a holy peace."
