    "Before you stands the Temple of Phoen.  Sunlight flashes from the facets of the golden, glaes-capped dome, and a sense of strength and security seems to emanate from the massive sandstone walls that support it.  The cylindrical form and dome of the temple echoes the shape of the beehives scattered around it in the clovered courtyard.",
    "Before you stands the Temple of Phoen.  The facets of the glaes-capped dome are clearly visible even by starlight, and a sense of strength and security seems to emanate from the massive sandstone walls that support it.  Echoing its form, the pale shapes of beehives stand scattered around it in the clovered courtyard."
