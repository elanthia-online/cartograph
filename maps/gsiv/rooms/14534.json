    "A break in the heavy foliage opens into a wide, stone terrace.  Numerous benches and tables sit in circles around a pebbled drinking well, offering a place to sit and rest.  A small flock of sun conures hop across the stone floor near the outskirts of the area, searching for anything of interest left behind by visiting guests."
