    "A sphere-hilted mounted sword plaque hangs on one of the knotty oak-paneled walls, and a wide-planked white cedar ceiling rises overhead.  An elegantly woven reed mat sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is a plank-covered barrel table on one side of the shop and a wide knotted oak counter on the other.",
