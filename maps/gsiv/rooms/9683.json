    "Tossed almost carelessly across the polished ebonwood flooring are patterned carpets with overlapping spheres in shades of pale blue and pink.  Opalescent curtains have been tied back to allow the sunlight to filter through the windows, giving the room a washed out look.  Placed beneath the window is a perfect miniature set of stocks, complete with a male figurine.  Working diligently, the head of a male clerk is barely visible above the huge stacks of papers covering the desktop."
