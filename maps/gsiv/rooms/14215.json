    "Soft amber light drifts down from above from several silver-chained dark-paned oil lamps, their diffused light traveling in gentle waves across the cozy surroundings.  A small but suitable hearth has been crafted out of the far southern wall, and large, functional counters of wood are heaped with fresh vegetables and a variety of herbs.  Simple black iron pots dangle from hooks above, clanking together gently once in a while to form a slow, rhythmic melody."
