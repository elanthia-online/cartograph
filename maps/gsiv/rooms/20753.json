    "Though the rink is enclosed in walls of pure ice, drakar torches emanate a subtle heat that keeps the area warm enough for comfort, but not hot enough to melt the ice.  The upward curving walls support a huge translucent dome-shaped roof through which the sky is clearly visible.  The sunlight beating down through the ice refracts and casts dappled shadows on the rink below.  Hugging the rink's wall beside the entrance is a carved felwood skate bin, while opposite, a winding staircase leads up.",
