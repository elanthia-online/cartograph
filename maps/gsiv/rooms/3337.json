    "A low hanging fog clings to ankles and swirls around the legs of pedestrians traversing the street.  The thick blanket is so dense that if it weren't for the occasional patches broken up by drafts out of the sewer grates, it would appear to be a solid snowbank.  The breeze that pervades the rest of the Trace is strangely absent along Shaman Road."
