    "The staircase ends abruptly in a large, round room that is freezing cold.  Torches clamped to the walls burn with odd blue flames, highlighting rusty shackles that are attached to the rough walls.  One set of shackles still holds a pitiful skeleton covered in scraps of tattered cloth.  A pointed archway in the wall leads out."
