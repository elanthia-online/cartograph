    "Shuttered windows guarded with slats of naturally dark blue thanot hinged with iron fittings and pulls are closed to keep out the cold air and ensure the room is cozy.  A small, rusted iron, potbellied stove, warmth radiating through the closed grate through which fiery coals glow, features a petite indigo tin kettle hanging from a crude hook fastened to the smoke pipe disappearing out a hole in the roof.  A small, disassembled hammock drapes close to a wall, stuffed with a pillow and blanket."
