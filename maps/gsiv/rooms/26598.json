    "Large and sturdy railings surround this aftmost and highest deck of the ship.  Fully exposed to the elements, the decking forms the ceiling for the aftcastle cabins below.  The view from the aft rails is of that of moonlit ocean swells, stretching out far astern.  Between the howls of gusting winds, all falls nearly silent, with only the sounds of waves lapping against the hull marking the passing of time.",

The view from the aft rails is that of ocean swells, stretching out far astern, porpoises surfacing nearby, and a few large birds, gliding past effortlessly on wide, outstreched wings."
