    "Polished rosewood paneling covers the walls of this lobby where arches inlaid with various gems and metals lead to smaller rooms.  A padded circular bench sits in the middle of the room and plush velvet armchairs rest along the wall to provide seating for those taking a break from gambling.  Overhead, an elaborate crystal chandelier sways gently with the movement of the ship."
