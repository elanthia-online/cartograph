  "description": [
    "Cabinets and counters decorate the northern wall around a small window framed by gauzy blue curtains.  Beneath the frameless structure, a small blue sea glass wash basin is set into the countertop, which also houses a teak drying rack.  In the center of the room, a round wooden table topped with white linen has some curve-backed teak chairs around it.  Hugging one wall, a wooden staircase leads into the shop below."
