    "[The Harrows, Hanging Valley]"

  "description": [
    "The valley is confined on three sides by a massif of dark, jagged peaks, their claw-like tines nearly drowning out sight of off-kilter peaks elsewhere in the mountain range.  A small stream snakes its way between gigantic black boulders, before spilling over the southern edge of the hung valley.  Nestled in the lee of the northern rim amid a maze of stunted hawthorn, a dark grey manor faces the open skyline.  A narrow slope leads down and out of the valley, its approach marked with an elaborate gate spiked with razern finials.",
    "The valley is confined on three sides by a range of dark, jagged rocks, their claw-like tines reaching up to a faint light high in the west.  A small stream, snaking through a maze of stunted hawthorn, spills out of sight to the south, where a break in the massif yields only the abyss of night.  Facing the dark skyline stands a two-story dark grey manor, its windows shrouded by curtains.  Arching bronze cressets stand before a narrow escarpment leading out of the valley, its approach marked with an elaborate razern gate."
