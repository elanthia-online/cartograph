    "A jumble of snowy rock cascades across the trail, blocking further progress to the east.  The stones descend to an expanse of flat tundra that stretches away to the northeast in an almost featureless plain.  Clouds of snow cross the vast wilderness of ice in the distance, moving like great behemoths over the land in a silent dance."
