    "An enormous, brick-faced fireplace with an elaborate mantel is the focal point of this warm and inviting room.  Two grey wingback chairs sit before a large desk flanked by tall candle stands, each bearing a triple-wicked candle that shines brightly, allowing business to be carried on well past sundown.  Opposite the fireplace is a large ebonwood bookcase filled with maps and leather-bound volumes of all colors and sizes.  Windows on the inner wall allow an unrestricted view of the night sky."
