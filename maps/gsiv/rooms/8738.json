    "Climbing vines cover the wooden fence that separates this quiet lane from the town streets to the west.  Well-kept flowerbeds are set around the houses that overlook the river far below.  A small dog scampers among the cobblestones, chasing the stray seagulls that occasionally alight on the road."
