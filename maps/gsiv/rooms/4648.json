    "Glass and teak shelves hang securely from the branches of a towering oak that rises through the center of this wide platform.  A pair of white linen-draped cots have been separated by a translucent curtain painted with whimsicial butterflies and flowers, in order to maintain patient privacy.  Gilded wind chimes jingle melodically in the breeze while delicately-scented votives perfume the air with their subtle fragrance."
