    "Laced with shadows from a heavy border of stout black oaks, a quiet clearing opens in the woods.   Squatting in its midst, the crumbling ruin of a small stone shack sits silently, humbled by time and weather.  A skin of damp moss and fungus grows along the remaining stone walls, and what may have once been a thatched roof has completely disappeared.  An open doorway, fringed with moss, leads to a shadowed interior.",
