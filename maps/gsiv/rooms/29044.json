    "Black bands are painted onto the high pilings that flank the pier, two on the east and three on the west, while small signs with slip numbers on them are tacked just beneath.  A larger sign proclaiming \"Pier 2 - Slips 5-10\" is tied to an oak and copper barrel that is filled with thick cork panels and heavily corded tie-off ropes.  The sound of waves crashing against the shore echoes through the area."
