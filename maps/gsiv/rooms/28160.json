  "description": [
    "Swathes of rich crimson and blue silk cover the walls of the pavilion, their shimmering lengths accented with bits of gold.  Several cushioned sofas and chairs covered in matching brocade are scattered about the area.  Hanging from the peaked ceiling are a trio of clear crystal lanterns suspended from a series of vaalin chains.  Placed in the center of the gathering space is an alabaster marble firepit, a copper urn of sticks sitting to one side."
