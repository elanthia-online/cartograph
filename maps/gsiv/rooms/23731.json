    "Floor tiles of alternating colors spiral outward from a central mosaic of a sprite.  A thick teal trunk and a slender silver strongbox are set against opposing walls.  Spheres of light are suspended magically overhead, each tented with colored silks.  Pinned to the wall by two steel spikes is a rugged red rucksack."
