    "Long, jagged furrows start out thin and shallow near the center of this part of the wheat field then widen and deepen until they plunge over the side of the culvert that skirts the field's southwestern edge.  Apparently heavy rains combined with the slight cant of the field caused the water to drain from the field faster than anticipated, and the result is a loss of wheat to the rocky bottom of the culvert and further downstream."
