    "A low, arched door grants entrance to a courtyard ringed with partitioned alcoves and tables.  The lamps here are lit both day and night, and the calm, dreamy atmosphere seems to blur the edges of time and place.  Here and there, tabletops are littered with braziers, coffeepots and cups, along with small glasses that offer stronger poisons."
