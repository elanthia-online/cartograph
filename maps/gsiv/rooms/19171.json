  "description": [
    "The air here is dense with fine sawdust that creates an almost magical aura around the lanterns set high on the ship's beams.  Puffs of air from a tar-slicked chute in one corner keep the motes in continuous motion, although more than a little has settled on a felt-lined ironwood rack and a wide-slatted grey modwir bin.  A few beetles scurry through the sawdust on the floor, leaving tiny trails in their wake."
