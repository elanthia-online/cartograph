    "The rows of corn stalks sweep northwest and east, following the best soil.",
    "The rows of corn stalks sweep northwest and east, following the best soil.  To the south, weeds occupy a large plot of fallow ground.  The ground is flat, and appears to once have been turned over by the plow.  Now it rests, acquiring nutrients and awaiting another planting season.  It will then be of better use to the farmer.  Beyond the fallow ground, farther south, a long stone wall extends northeast and southwest, most likely paralleling the Victory Road."
