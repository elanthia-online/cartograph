    "A narrow crevice sweeps close to the edge of the plateau before running away in a zigzag fashion.  Down in the crevice, the body of a dwarf has lodged between the rock walls, the dwarf's clothing shredded by contact with the sharp protrusions along the close surfaces.  The dwarf's body has been nicely mummified by the arid conditions, with the skin pulled tight and slightly wrinkled by the dehydration.  The dwarf's head peers upward, mouth agape, as if still hoping for rescue."
