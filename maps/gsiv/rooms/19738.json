  "description": [
    "Climbing roses clamber up the northern wall of this expansive garden, their large, fragrant blooms reduced to whites, and greys in the moonlight.  Topiary animals frolic among hybrid tea roses, and sizeable rocks, their tops flattened to resemble stone end tables, sit beside metal rocking chairs accompanied by burning torches.  A winding stairway ascends steeply to the northeast, while a stone stairway drops away quickly to the southeast.  Flickering lights dance from a shaded nook."
