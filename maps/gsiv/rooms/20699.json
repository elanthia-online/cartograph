    "Pale pink walls surround this small room that is little more than a spacious closet.  Leaning up against one wall, a small table stands beside a curved petal pink doorway that leads out of the room.  Nearby, a young attendant stands ready to serve.  The focal point of the room is a swirling iridescent portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Sprawling cherry blossom branches have been etched into the metal, their flowering lengths mingling near the top, reminiscent of a garden bower."
