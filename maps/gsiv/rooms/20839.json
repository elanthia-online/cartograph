    "Resembling a naturally formed cave, most of the walls of this great room are clearly unfinished, while the floor is covered with a massive bearskin rug.  Off to one side sits an elongated hide couch and a towering bone desk that have been crafted for function instead of style.  Mounted on the wall is an expansive plaque with stuffed heads of beasts gathered from all corners of the lands.  The entire aft wall has been sculpted into the head of a griffin, its slit-eyes reflecting light."
