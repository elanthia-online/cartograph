    "Various etching tools line the walls of this small but well-kept stand.  In the very back, an obviously bored clerk stands behind a finely polished modwir counter.  Behind the counter, boxes and boxes of pins are stacked to the ceiling, and various bits of metal can be seen coating the ground."
