    "Concentric swirls of interleaved gold and brass erupt outward from a pedestal standing at the center of an expanse of cavernous, featureless darkness.  Blacker than night and unalleviated save by the glow of the orb atop the pedestal, the emptiness encompasses all but the floor, which seems to spiral outward to the furthest vagaries of sight.  The air smells faintly of brine and pitch."
