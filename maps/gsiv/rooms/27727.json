  "description": [
    "At night, this section of wall is dominated more by smells than sights.  From the west comes the smell of broiling meats and baking tarts, while from the east wafts the acrid smell of pine needles and decay.  Immediately below the wall, Trade Alley teems less-than-savory customers."
