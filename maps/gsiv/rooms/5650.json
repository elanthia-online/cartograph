    "A dented iron cauldron resting upon a crude firepit constructed of smooth round stones seems to be the lone cooking utensil in the room.  The pot is heavily stained from constant use and a few bits of food stubbornly cling to the outside of the metal.  Several coarse baskets filled with grain have been stored near the stove, but one look at the feasting weevils gives evidence that freshness is not an issue for whoever prepares the meals of this burrow."
