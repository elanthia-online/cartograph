    "A pair of lanterns with cut crystal shades hang directly over a delicately carved jewelry stand, the pristine light dancing over every reflective surface under its touch.  Further into the area, a doorless golden oak armoire stands off to the side - a hulking piece of furniture itself, it is dwarfed by the high ceilings of wagon.  Near the armoire, sits a tiered shoe rack, and just a few steps away, a drawn ivory marbrinus curtain leads into another section of the shop."
