    "Exotic cacti from more arid far-away lands are part of the collection in the west ell of the Hedgerow Neighborhood Gardens.  The landscaping closely resembles those distant ecosystems, complete with enclosures for animals.  It seems the original owner left instructions in his will that the grounds would be kept as a living natural museum for all to enjoy."
