    "The stream flowing from the stony meadowland to the south gathers in a large waterhole which spreads placidly before you.  The herds have worn a path from the pastures and along the waterhole towards a heavily leaning tree that can be seen to the west.  A breeze gently wafts over the pool, creating a barely noticeable ripple."
