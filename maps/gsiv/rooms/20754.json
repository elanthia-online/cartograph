    "The balcony wraps around the entire structure and offers a full view of the rink below.  From here the skaters gliding in circles around the ice would look like toys on a fancy music box.  Lining the walls are several potbellied stoves that sit on brick platforms between cozy aqua blue sofas.  A descending staircase hugs the wall opposite the railing."
