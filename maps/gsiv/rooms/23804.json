    "A bloodjewel chandelier dims the surroundings, giving enough light to see the inventory strewn everywhere.  Spread out across the floor of the cramped room are treasure chests, each filled to the brim with piercing rings, half-rings, studs, spikes, and bars.  Small circular holes, some with iron thorns protruding from them, riddle the stone walls."
