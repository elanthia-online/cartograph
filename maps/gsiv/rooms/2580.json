    "The sound of hoofbeats approaches rapidly.  When you whirl around, a white horse emerges from the surrounding mist with a black robed figure on its back.  As the horse gallops by, the sound of a blade cutting the air fills your ears, and a burst of wind brushes your neck.  The horseman quickly fades into the mist before you, a scythe the last thing you see as it disappears."
