    "Herbs grow in riotous profusion along the path and the only evidence of design is the orderly grouping of the plants by use.  The cool, clean scents of mint and lavender perfume the air, while dittany and borage grow in the shade of a nearby oak tree.  The murmur of running water comes from somewhere to the west."
