    "Sunlight pours in through the wide windows at the front of the shop, its golden glow brightening the slate blue curtains and whitewashed walls.  Several round tables and oak chairs are arranged in social circles throughout the room, while to the back a long counter separates the kitchen from the dining area.  A large easel supports a sign that is cut into the shape of a frying pan, its smooth surface scribed with tidy white lettering on a black background."
