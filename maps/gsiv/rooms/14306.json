  "description": [
    "Pale haon wood is burnished to a silvery hue and brushed with touches of gold, giving it an antiqued appearance.  Heavy storm grey brocade curtains are fastened with silk ties down the middle, keeping the outside light at bay.  Ora bowls of all sizes are filled with white candles, creating a decorative element around a large white wrought iron bed swathed in soft grey silk.  Tuberose stalks stand in a tall vase upon a round table that also offers the occupants half-full snifters of crystalline pear brandy."
