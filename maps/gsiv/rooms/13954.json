    "Candle fixtures wrought of faenor hang from the high fel beamed ceiling illuminating a long birchwood counter.  Placed against the back wall is a worktable scattered with various tools, vials, and wedges for opening locked containers.  Two large windows flank a narrow ladder that leads up to a loft area.  A lush verdant fern in a large ceramic pot is placed in the far corner, its leaves falling over onto the patterned floor."
