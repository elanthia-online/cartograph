    "A circle of flat grey stone serves as a quaint little sitting area, and numerous velvet-padded wrought-iron chairs arranged in half-circles offer a comforting respite.  Young shrubs and bushes encircle the area, while a rock formation to the northwest houses a miniature waterfall that trickles pleasingly every few moments.  Crimson-hued candles huddle in the shadow of the balcony above, casting their moody light across the area in rippling waves."
