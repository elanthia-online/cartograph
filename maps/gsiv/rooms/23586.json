    "A raised mural on the back wall depicts a scene of a young man kneeling before a white-robed male figure.  Tilted diagonally, a highly polished speckled marble-top table rests along the western wall, and expertly embossed gold chests lie open and empty on either side of it.  A mosaic pattern in the floor depicts a wizened woman bent over an oversized book."
