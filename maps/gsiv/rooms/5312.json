    "An enruned thanot door opens to the outside, giving a view of the deep forest.  Ruined splendors fill this area, likely once the foyer of the temple, telling a story of destruction and neglect.  Yellow topaz eyes surround the portal, each looking at you and eerily seeming to track your movements."
