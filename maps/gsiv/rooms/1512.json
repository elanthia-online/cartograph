    "A low wall, constructed of various-sized stones, boards and odd pieces of refuse, surrounds a small plot of land between the end of the paved road and the canal.  A statue of a monkey, almost as tall as a halfling, squats in the middle of the lot, while a middle-aged woman dressed in drab, threadbare robes and an oversized horned helm putters tirelessly about the area, apparently unperturbed by the darkness.",
