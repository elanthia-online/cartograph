    "A natural stair is formed by overlapping branches, offering passage from the branches of one oak to its neighboring trees.  Leaves sway gently at the touch of a light breeze and birds flitter from limb to limb.  Below, dense growths of ferns and rhododendrons created an emerald splash amid the drab greys and browns of the forest floor.",

Black leaves sway gently at the touch of a light breeze and tree frogs sing to the moon.  Below, dense growths of ferns and rhododendrons created a dark emerald splash amid the shadows on the forest floor."
