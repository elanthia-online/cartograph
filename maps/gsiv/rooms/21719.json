  "description": [
    "Brittle, curling leaves mix with layers of dust and debris on the worn stone floor.  The moldy, rotten remnants of a wooden weapons rack sit next to a narrow, western-facing window.  Long, thin fingers of ivy cling to the inside edge of the window, invading the fortress inch by slow inch.  A stone stairway juts out from the circular tower walls and winds upward, disappearing through a warped hole in the rough plank ceiling."
