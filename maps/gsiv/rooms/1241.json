    "A thick canopy of tightly intertwined branches closes off most of the moonlight, making the area appear as if the night were heavily overcast.  Sharp brambles choke the trail, and thick moss underfoot makes the passage a slippery one.  To the northeast the trees appear to thin somewhat, and the sound of a rushing river can be heard.  The nearby river moderates the temperature, making it damp but cool.",
