    "The massive bed standing under the window leaves no room for other furniture.  An overabundance of pillows in green and gold tones pile high against the headboard, and a leaf-patterned comforter spreads across the deep mattress.  A rug in autumnal golds and oranges lies next to the bed, protecting warm feet from cold morning floors."
