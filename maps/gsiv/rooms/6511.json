  "description": [
    "The road curves through a stand of hemlock and beech trees.  The conifers add their distinctive scent to the crisp air, and squirrels run chattering through the branches, occasionally dislodging large beechnuts.  Sprouts of young beech crowd the feet of the larger trees, making thick underbrush.  The thicket quivers from time to time with the antics of a hidden population of wildlife sheltered there."
