    "Draped with soft blankets of moss that flutter to-and-fro of their own accord, spindly cedar trees ring the area.  Their branches stretch out overhead, creating a brittle web across the dark sky.  In the center of the clearing, the ground is slightly lumpy, though firmly packed, and riddled with a light dusting of ashes.  Several blackened cedar stumps jut out of the ground in front of a particurlarly wide arc of grey-green moss.",
