  "description": [
    "A large inland lake stretches out to the east, circled by a well-traveled dirt road.  The forest closes in on the path all around the lake, making a beautiful landscape for watching the sunrise.  A breeze from the west blows the trees gently, and dips down to make occasional ripples on the lake.  A hill slopes down into a foggy valley to the west."
