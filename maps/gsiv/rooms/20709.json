    "Crimson walls surround this small room that is little more than a spacious closet.  Leaning up against one wall, a small table stands beside a curved golden doorway that leads out of the room.  Nearby, a young attendant stands ready to serve.  The focal point of the room is a swirling red and gold portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Intricate wyverns have been etched into the metal, their sinuous lengths intertwined, creating a complex scrollwork pattern."
