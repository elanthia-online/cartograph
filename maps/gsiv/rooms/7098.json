    "The eastern and northern walls of this corner curve to meet each other smoothly, rather than forming a sharp angle as do the other walls in these passages.  Formed of flat, colored stones, a bright mosaic diagram covers the curve from floor to ceiling, and a double armspan wide.  Unfamiliar symbols radiate out from the diagram, looking rather like text but in no alphabet with which you are familiar."
