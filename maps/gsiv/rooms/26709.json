    "To the west lies the mid-ship passageway and a gracefully curved glass wall supported by wooden beams surrounding the former sunbathing deck which overlooks a large pool.  A disproportionately large lantern is affixed to the stern bulkhead, the countless squares of differently colored glaes that form the fixture obscured by plankton."
