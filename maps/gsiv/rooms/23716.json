    "The narrow interior of the building contains only a bench with several holes cut out along its length.  A strong odor of lye and hay emanate from the holes with just the slightest scent of urine and feces.  Discarded copies of a Wehnimer's Landing newspaper lay within arm's reach of the bench across the floor."
