    "Darkness cloaks the area like a thick fog, only the outlines of lichen lining the walls are discernable in the blackness. The moist air is very still, and not a sound reaches the confines of this winding tunnel.  Tatters of stained cloth are spread across the floor, along with the vague impressions of small bits of bone."
