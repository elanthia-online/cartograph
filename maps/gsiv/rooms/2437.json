  "description": [
    "Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves fill every inch of wall space in this room, and wheeled ladders stand ready for the clerk's use in reaching the higher shelves.  At the front of the office stands a long counter, its surface covered with a fine layer of dust that is undisturbed except in the area surrounding a large, leatherbound tome.  Two large torches burn on the walls, their light gilding the ubiquitous dust motes that float through the heavy air."
