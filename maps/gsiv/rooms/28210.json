    "Dominating the room are a pair of huge tables, one draped with sapphire blue and the other with crimson silk.  Their crystal-balled feet are cushioned by a white and gold patterned carpet.  Matching chairs surround the large pieces, the seats padded with rich golden velvet.  A large buffet stands off to one side, its cloth-covered surface piled high with rich dishes and drink."
