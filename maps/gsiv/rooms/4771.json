    "An ancient oak stump, standing just taller than the height of a common human, rises from the thick grasses, its blackened bark in sharp contrast to their yellowed blades.  Devoid of limbs or leaves, the hardened bark of the stump has been lacerated with gouges, cuts and slashes, lending it the appearance of being striped.  The faint scent of burning wood lingers around the old trunk.",
