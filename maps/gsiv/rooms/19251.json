    "A large round skylight bathes the room in pale moonlight, washing over the broad monir workbench and flowing outward.  Covering the top of the workbench is a thick slab of blue-veined marble, pitted and marred in several spots.  The walls are plain and bare, except for a stylized painting of ephlox moss, underscoring the utilitarian nature of the area."
