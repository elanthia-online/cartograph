  "description": [
    "The pathway narrows here with the peripheral encroachment of gnarled hardwoods draped in vines.  Little light pierces the canopy above, with only narrow beams of sunlight reaching the shrub-tangled forest floor.  The entwined aromas of stale urine and fresh dung permeate the still air, threatening to precipitate a bout of nausea for those with delicate tummies."
