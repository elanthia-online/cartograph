    "A narrow pathway of sawtoothed stone curves up the base of the gargantuan spire, beginning at a rocky outcropping near the base and rising toward the formation's flaring head.  Although ragged and sharp-edged, the path ascends too evenly to be entirely natural.  It proceeds past colorful swirls on the hammer's face, and these, at least, are certainly not the work of a mortal hand."
