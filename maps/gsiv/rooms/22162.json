    "A large oil painting done in tackily bright colors dominates the wall behind the table.  Staring out from the canvas is a slightly heavyset woman, dressed in clashing finery.  While the pose she has been painted in is meant to be provocative, it only serves to make her look further overdone and overbearing.  In her hand, she is wielding a large battleaxe."
