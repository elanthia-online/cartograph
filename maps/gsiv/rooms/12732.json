    "Through the narrow corridor flanked by towering columns, the wind howls like some haunting specter.  A mountainous pile of collapsed wall lies to the south, leaving behind no clues as to what once lay there.  Marking a navigable trail is a headless statue, a portion of its stoic face staring up from the ground."
