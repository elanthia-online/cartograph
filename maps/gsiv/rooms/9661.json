  "description": [
    "The walls, floor and atmosphere are all rough inside this tavern, but the place is well lighted and the dwarf behind the bar doesn't look like he'd take much guff.  A long table extends down the middle of the public area, and a multitude of benches surround the table to give patrons a place to drink and visit.  Small lamps hung on the walls provide smoky but ample lighting, and the tavern is swept and free of dirt.  The odors of stale ale and pipe smoke linger in the air."
