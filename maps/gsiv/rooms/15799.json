    "Light dimly filters in from the east, revealing the difficult terrain of the hallway.  Three cell doors line the walls here, one set in each wall.  Formed of hammered plates of mithril and imflass, the western door is intermittently covered with cryptic runes.  The wrought mithril bars of the northern cell door have been wickedly barbed to prevent any stray hands from reaching through.  Finally, a solid door of riveted iron has been set into the ice on the south side of the corridor."
