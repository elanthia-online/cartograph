    "Variegated maps of mixed depth, detail and scale plaster the walls of this office.  Pins with little scraps of paper are affixed to the maps, identifying properties for sale or lease.  Not surprisingly, the musty smell of old parchment perfumes the place.  Behind the clerk's desk is a large cabinet honeycombed with tiny compartments, each stuffed with dozens of scrolls, most likely deeds for homes and property."
