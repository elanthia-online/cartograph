    "The vast hall is filled with dozens of seats.  To the front, open velvet curtains frame a large stage perfect for performances, meetings, or lecturing large groups.  Overhead, crystal teardrops dangle from brass chandeliers.  The entrance to a small office stands discretely at the back of the hall."
