    "Your legs strain as you climb the steep road here, which follows a crevice carved out from the cliff face by a small stream.  Switchbacks make a road a possiblility here, but the progress is agonizingly slow as you track back and forth.  The section below you goes down to the northeast, and the trail winds up the cliff to the southeast."
