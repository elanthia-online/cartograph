    "Hollowed directly out of the mountain, this office is little more than a formalized cave.  The walls are cold and damp, and the floor is uneven.  An old mining cart holds stacks of bundled paper, and rough plank benches provide somewhere moderately comfortable to sit.  Guttering torches hang in wall brackets, darkening the ceiling with soot."
