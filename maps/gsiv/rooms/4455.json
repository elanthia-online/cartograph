    "Golden flames dance in mithril-caged lanterns set along the spacious tunnel.  The walls and ceiling are reinforced at intervals with broad oak beams.  A low, sturdy invar rack padded with gnarp wool displays an assortment of maces and morning stars to people passing by the north wall.  To the south, a long, granite block sits against the rock face.  More weaponry has been arrayed upon the granite."
