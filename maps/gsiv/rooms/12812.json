  "description": [
    "The odor of cooking chocolate hangs so heavily in the air that you can almost taste it.  Voices carry from the kitchen in a constant exchange of instructions, comments, and quips.  Occasionally, the swinging door leaps open as a white-aproned Halfling or Elf brings out a pan of fresh morsels to stock the displays."
