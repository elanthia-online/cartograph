    "Blanketed in azalea and wild lilac bushes, the cobblestone path forms a gentle curve that hugs the landscape and ambles through an intricate wrought iron gate.  Thin blades of grass, coached into artful tufts, are bright green in the sunlight and speckled with tiny violets the hue of periwinkle feystones.  A slender post dangles a dormant lantern, which creaks lightly as it sways gently in a seaward breeze that is warm and inviting.",
    "Strong white light spills onto the cobblestone pathway as it follows the gentle curve of the landscape and ambles through an intricate wrought iron gate, its source a lantern dangling from a slender post.  The illuminating glow gives life to the dark azalea and wild lilac bushes that blanket the area, as well as tiny violets the hue of periwinkle feystones that mingle with thin blades of beach grass.  Rising from the north, the seaward breeze is soothing and carries with it the soft sound of waves touching to shore."
