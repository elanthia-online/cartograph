    "Deep beach and scrub grasses cover the area between the high stucco wall and the rocky reef to the south.  Maelstrom Bay stretches out beyond the reef to the southwest.  The horizon there is indistinguishable from the great western sea.  From this angle, the blue-tiled roof of the tower to the northeast is barely visible behind the wall."
