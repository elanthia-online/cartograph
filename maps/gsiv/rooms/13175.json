    "Lofty elder trees spread their branches toward the night sky to either side of a yellow-bricked path, which extends from a pair of white stone columns to a high, gold-rimmed archway leading into the temple.  Rising above dewy banks of amaranth and cinquefoil, the edifice is a massive confection of gold and blanched stone.  Phosphorescent globes spaced about the base of the temple set its aureate windows aglitter.",
    "Lofty elder trees cast their cool shadows on the yellow-bricked path extending from a pair of white stone columns to a high, gold-rimmed archway that leads into the temple.  Rising high above banks of lush amaranth and vivid cinquefoil, the edifice is a massive confection of sparkling gold and blanched stone.  Crystal windows ranging in shades from amber to flax glisten in the daylight."
