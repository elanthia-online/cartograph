    "The freezing waters below the ship create a dark-colored backdrop to a single polished oak table set in the middle of the deck, the furniture surrounded by a half-dozen canvas chairs.  In front of each seat is an elaborate place setting, the intact display an eerie juxtaposition to the chaos that has engulfed the rest of the ship."
