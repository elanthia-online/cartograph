    "The room is triangular, the \"prow\" of the shiplike structure.  On the dirt walls are faded remains of strange murals.  The line drawings all have an oppressive and ominous sameness about them, even though they depict different scenes.  You approach one wall to get a closer look, stooping down as the elevation of the roof drops sharply."
