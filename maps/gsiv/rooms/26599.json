  "description": [
    "A large, four-poster bed, amassed with corpulent pillows and covered in a nautical-themed quilt, peeks out beneath a draping of guazy fabric suspended from the ceiling.  The surrounding room is nearly entirely taken up by a heavily lacquered oak table, strewn with maps, star charts, and drawings on various slips of parchment.  A gold-trimmed telescope, mounted beneath a large, open, brass-rimmed porthole, provides views of the surrounding lands, seas, and sky."
