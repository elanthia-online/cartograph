  "description": [
    "A small outcropping of moss-covered grey stone allows a tiny stream to trickle down in a serene waterfall into a large, circular pool that breaks up the soft verdant hue of the forest with a deep, rippling blackness.  Young trees grow along the edges and in between the gaps of the grey stone, their sparse, green boughs casting pale shadows across the surroundings.  Faint slivers of luminescence alight in the pool from time to time, and the area holds a tranquil silence."
