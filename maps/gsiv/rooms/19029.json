  "description": [
    "A narrow silver carpet runs down the center of this small shop, dividing it into two halves.  On the grey marble floor of one rests a mannequin made from fine platinum wires, while the other section contains a platinum tray resting upon a mahogany stand.  Several lamps hovering in midair illuminate the room, drifting slowly about.  A fine silk banner covers part of one sparkling, white quartz wall.  The other three are decorated only by the gilt trim at top and bottom."
