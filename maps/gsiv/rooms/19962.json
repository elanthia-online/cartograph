    "A replica massive bronze gate stands at the edge of a diorama sporting crumbling gravestones and wax figures.  In the remaining half of the room, a model granite crypt rests on the grey pebbled floor, surrounded by green silk weeds that encroach on the dilapidated structure.  A miniature black altar and a replicated marble monument sit on either side of the pale green rug that traverses the clear pathway through the room, ending with a carved modwir arch.  The sounds of wind whistling eerily and the mournful creaking of a metal gate can be heard every so often."
