  "description": [
    "Sunshine streams down through a crystal skylight over the circular room.  Benches carved with oak and maple leaf motifs are lined in a semi-circle around a raised platform, and a small set of spiral steps leads up to it.  Candles stand in elegant brass sconces imbedded with faceted amethysts, and a large mural stretches around the wall's circle depicting an immense modwir tree where the clan met long ago.  Black Swan castle sits on the mural's far horizon like an ominous black crow."
