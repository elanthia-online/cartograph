    "Water courses out of a pair of small metal pipes to cascade over several rocks before filling a shallow pool.  Dwarves come from all directions to fill containers, urns, cups, pitchers, and other water-bearing vessels.  The pool reflects the crystalline dome, bringing in the colors from overhead and dispersing them on the walls and rocks in an enthralling display of rippling rainbow hues.  Splashed water covers the floor around the pool, making footing somewhat slippery."
