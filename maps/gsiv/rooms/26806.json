    "The circular black oak table is polished to a high sheen, its surface glimmering with reflected light.  A set of high-backed chairs surrounds the table, each padded with deep red velvet upholstery.  The rounded edge of the table is bordered with inlaid jade, forming a twisting pattern of serpents."
