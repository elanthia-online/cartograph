  "description": [
    "Fighting for domination of the street are twin grey slate-shingled houses.  The blackened cobblestones seem to cower under the baleful glare of these two weathered matriarchs.  Sprawling beside each house is a large barred workshop, the doors to both are secured with several sturdy-looking padlocks.  A half-drawn shade covers one of the lower windows of the left house."
