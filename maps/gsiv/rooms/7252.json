    "Intermittent pools of murky water smear a scummy film over the ground as seepage through the porous humus has made it a shifting, almost liquid mass.  The wet earth here cannot support the tombstones upright.  Tilted at odd angles, or fallen, the markers are now partially submerged or sunken in the mud."
