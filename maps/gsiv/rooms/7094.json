    "A mummified head screams silent agony from where it's entombed in the wall.  The wall, of brick and plaster, was built around the neck with the head protruding from the other side.  Likewise trapped are two hands, their fingers straining toward you, and two feet.  The legs must have been broken to get the feet to stick out at that angle.  The victim must have died slowly and in a state of terrified madness."
