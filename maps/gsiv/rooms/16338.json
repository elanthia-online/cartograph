    "Stained glass windows, each decorated with wild tropical blooms, casts a myriad of rainbow hues upon the lush white carpeting that blankets the room.  Sconces upon the walls house tiny copper-sided lanterns, their faces depicting the cut-out images of fireflies, damselflies, and dragonflies.  Scattered in an informal pattern about the room are soft divans, plump couches, and robust armchairs.  A carved double-wide archway leads into the hallway beyond.",
