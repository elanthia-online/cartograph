    "Three walls of this room are occupied by massive floor-to-ceiling bookshelves of gleaming mahogany.  In the middle of the room, a tall podium holds a large catalog.  The area is lit by a massive glass globe filled with darting fireflies, perhaps in an attempt to protect the library's precious contents from fire.  Sunlight falls in slanting rays from the passage created by a spiraling wrought iron staircase.",
