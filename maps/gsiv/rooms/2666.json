  "description": [
    "The alcove is octagonal, its perimeter surrounded by a row of double columns boasting highly decorated capitals supporting likewise elegantly carved entablatures.  On the eastern wall is a cistern, into which drops of water fall from somewhere in the shadows of the high ceiling.  The droplets send a stately drum of sound into the chamber's hollow silence."
