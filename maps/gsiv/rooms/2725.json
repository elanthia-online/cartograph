    "The biting wind howls incessantly over a sharp precipice, whipping jagged pieces of ice around brutally. Deep indentations have been etched into the surface ice covering the precipice from the ferocity of the wind.  High overhead, several large icicles look dangerously close to falling from a small outcropping."
