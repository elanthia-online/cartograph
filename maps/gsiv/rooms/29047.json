    "Deep, muddy ruts mark the pathways of narrow hand-pulled carts that seem to have traversed this road many times.  Tangles of twisted vines encroach upon the roadway, making passage to and from the village beyond difficult for more substantial means of conveyance.  Guttural sounds of alarm can be heard to the northeast."
