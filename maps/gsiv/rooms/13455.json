    "The wharf possesses a generous width and extends out over the clear water of Tyro Pond for about 30 feet.  Beneath the wooden planks of the deck, reflected moonlight creates a shimmer of sparkles on the lake's dark surface. The serenade of frogs and night birds is a constant backdrop.",
    "The wharf possesses a generous width and extends out over the clear water of Tyro Pond for about 30 feet.  Beneath the wooden planks of the deck, the supple shapes of fish can be glimpsed occasionally, darting through water foliage or just hovering in place.  Sizes range from small sunfish to larger varieties that are more elusive.  Terns and other birds use the flat-topped pilings lining the wharf's sides as handy perches."
