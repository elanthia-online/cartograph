  "description": [
    "Leading up to a raised copper dais, the polished floor has a sickly greenish hue.  It is inlaid with tiles of reddish pink stone the color of raw flesh, each etched with a swirl of smoke.  Before the dais, a grisly bronze statue stands, glistening obscenely in yellow-green light flickering from hundreds of candles crowding the borders of the chancel."
