  "description": [
    "Nestled amidst towering modwir and willow trees is an expansive rose garden that stretches across one entire side of the grounds.  Surrounded by wrought iron fencing and trimmed verdant hedges, the garden embodies soothing tranquility as it mutes the sounds of the town.  Lines of rose beds border a curving path that leads to the edge of a deep blue pond and a small wooden fishing dock.  Tucked in near some shady trees is a worn wooden bench facing a bubbling rose quartz marble fountain."
