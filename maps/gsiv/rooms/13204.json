    "Wooden chandelier rings with bronze torches hang from massive link chains and offer faint illumination.  Multiple high-backed bar stools line the cherrywood bar, while racks of crystal wine glasses and goblets are suspended from above.  Handcrafted black oak tables surrounded by royal blue cushioned chairs are placed around the room.  On the northern wall, opposite the archway, a wooden platform supplies an ample stage for various performers."
