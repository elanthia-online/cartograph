  "description": [
    "Surrounding the busy Silver Park, Roundabout Way is a much quieter respite from the din.  Evergreen bushes line the roadway, a guardian to the yards fronting neighborhood houses whose windows overlook the fields.  A dog barks frequently in the distance breaking the quiet that otherwise reigns over the area."
