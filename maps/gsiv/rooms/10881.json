    "Tiers of carved stone seats descend in orderly, semi-circular waves toward a stage at the lower end of the open-air amphitheater.  Overhead, the sky provides a black velvet ceiling, sparkling with stars and the moons.  Cerulean blue stage curtains as well as the stage itself are shielded from any inclement weather by an overhanging roof.",
