    "This clearing between stacks of burlap sacks and heavy crates is rife with the mingled odors of jute and oakum.  In the amber light of a brass lantern strung between the hanging ballast of iron-banded molasses barrels, a lean grimalkin laps avidly at a hardened puddle of the syrup.  Beyond the freight, a wayward belaying pin describes the same rattling arc in the back-and-forth influence of wind and tide."
