    "Far cooler than the outdoor platforms above, the room is dimly lit by two feeble candles placed on two large wooden stands opposite each other by opposing walls.  Much of the wall space is covered in large wooden shelves and a series of cabinets replete with many small wooden drawers.  A few inches of dust cover much of everything, including the floor, revealing a number of tiny clawed footprints."
