    "The small cranny of a shop has walls painted a deep shade of burgundy, which are edged with polished oak.  Shelves cover the back wall, fronted by a low counter with a glass top and shallow drawers beneath that.  One small window gives a view of the mountainside, but heavy bars criss-cross the view just outside the glass, protecting the room from intrusion.",
