    "Sunlight filters through the heavy, leaded crystal windows that span floor to ceiling on the port and starboard sides.  A gold-accented, circular mahogany bar sits in the center of the dark green marble floor, and a silver and gold buffet table is pushed against one wall.  A heavy tapestry partially blocks the hallway toward the prow, and a door leads to the aft."
