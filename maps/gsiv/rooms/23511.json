  "description": [
    "Although somewhat slippery due to the mist that continually rains down on this spot, the rocks are formed in such a way as to provide easy stepping, standing, and sitting spots.  A small plaque is embedded in the middle of the rocks.  On either side of the island of rocks, which provide a fantastic view of both Wehnimer's Landing and the large expanse of water that is Darkstone Bay, are makeshift gangplanks, one leading on to a small and shoddy boat, the other to a small and weathered boat."
