    "Velvet-padded wooden stools are spaced near to the railing of the small balcony, meant to provide rest for the musicians who entertain the abbey's guests.   The traceries of the parapet are ornate and intricate.  Several music stands are stowed to one corner, discreetly out of view of the grand hall below."
