  "description": [
    "Lustrous ebonwood beams frame the tavern.  Some of the walls are painted dove grey while others are dark crimson, lending an enclosed and intimate aura to the room.  A zebrawood dart board lies between ebon bourde tapestries.  The heady scent of malt mingles with a rustic fragrance of oak burning within the river stone fireplace.  Scattered throughout the tavern, a handful of ironwood trestle tables are surrounded by padded barrel chairs.  A glowing alabaster bar situated at the back beckons patrons to approach."
