    "[The Knight Way, Lance Stall]"

  "description": [
    "Cloth banners cut into uneven panels line the sides and front of the stall, their alternating royal blue, black, gold, and vermillion color schemes creating a montage of rich color.  Merchants pace in front of and around the stall, a constant stream of yelling about the fine quality of their wares spouting from their lips.  Well-made, traditionally styled accoutrements of a knight adorn a mannequin in the center of the stall, with spare accessories and surcoats spread across a display."
