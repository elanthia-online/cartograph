    "Polished to a gleaming shine, an enormous pale oak table sits in the center of the room, surrounded by high-backed chairs accented with blue velvet.  Placed under a silk-draped window on the western wall, a large sideboard supports a silver and glass tray.  A tapestry map of Solhaven, woven from fine Vornavian wool, hangs upon the northern wall."
