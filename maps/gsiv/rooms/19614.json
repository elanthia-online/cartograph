  "description": [
    "Sunlight glints off the polished rosewood and mahogany decks.  A heavy dark mahogany door banded with ornate gold filigree leads inside the riverboat, while the deck wraps about it all.  To the northwest, a large foredeck is visible, and to the aft, the large paddlewheel can be seen.  Carefully piled silk rope sits next to a gaily beribboned mahogany gangplank leading off the boat, an iron ring peeking through the layers."
