    "Large chitinous plates, possibly from kiramon, cover this stretch of the boneyard.  The plates interlock to form a patchwork of armor.  A few cracks have spread from larger holes which appear to be severe puncture wounds.  Night winds, cool and crisp, flow across the holes, creating a low whistle.",
