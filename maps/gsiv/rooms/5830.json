    "A vibrant deciduous forest presses toward the waters of the Mistydeep River, leaving scant room for passage between the trees and the riverbank.  Cutting into the forest to the northeast, a well-maintained cobblestone road provides sure footing for travelers wishing to venture that direction, while a massive limestone bridge leads southwest, out over the river's waters toward an impressive city."
