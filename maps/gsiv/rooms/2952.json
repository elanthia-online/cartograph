  "description": [
    "Left open to the crisp air of day via vast maple doors, the great hall is a cavernous chamber lined with long wooden benches that march in neatly ordered rows beneath its gabled windows.  At its eastern end, two steps lead from the main floor to the dais.  Three lancet windows on the eastern wall halo the dais in light, crowned by a wheel-shaped window inset with rose-colored stained glass.  The small minstrels' gallery sits over the oak-paneled buttery screen that graces the western wall.",
