    "Beneath gabled windows, continuous benches line the walls of the great hall.  At the eastern end of the room, two steps lead from the main floor to the dais.  Three lancet windows on the eastern wall are crowned by a traceried wheel-shaped window inset with glass in a rosy tint.  The small minstrels' gallery sits over the oak-paneled buttery screen which fills the western wall."
