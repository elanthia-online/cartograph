    "Three small shops, all alike in construction and style, frame this section of the courtyard.  The space between their buildings is taken up with the tarpulin-covered stalls and tables of the daily market, though only a few such obstacles sit near their fronts.  Arching out of the Court is the marble span of a bridge.",
