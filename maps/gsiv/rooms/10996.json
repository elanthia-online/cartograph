    "The tall columns of green riverstone support a large dome.  The interior is lined with deep blue diamond-shaped ceramic tiles.  Dense ivy vines grow in abundance between the columns.  Lining the side and rear walls of the pavilion is a complex oaken frame on which tens of thousands of small, tubular silver bells are hung.  Hanging in the center of the pavilion, directly above a large, lichen-covered stone, is a large tubular bell.  A ball-headed mallet hangs on a leather thong beside the bell."
