  "description": [
    "Stark in furnishing, the room sits as a fitting tribute to a simple man devoted to a single mission.  Aside from a neatly made cot at one end, nothing else in the room gives away the ownership or the presence of a keeper.  At the far end of this barren retreat is a black velvet-shrouded altar set with a broken skull and a sharply-honed dagger.  Silver gilded candles on either side have been lit, and reflect in the mirror set directly behind the tiny shrine."
