    "Looming in the distance is a large mountain that stands in the center of the island.  A cloud of mist surrounds the upper portion of the mountain, hiding it from view, while thick jungles ring it in a skirt of verdant hues.  Winding its way through rolling foothills is a twisting passage that leads to the distant peaks."
