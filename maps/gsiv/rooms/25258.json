    "Several stone fragments clutter the interior of an arched niche in the western wall, the sole remains of what appears to have been a painted tablet.  The abrupt length of hallway is otherwised untouched, from its walls of brass-adorned sandstone down to the runner of emerald velvet that proceeds in a sinuous fashion along the floor, inexorably curving upward to the tower's zenith."
