    "Splintered and broken, bottle racks line the walls, and the shattered pieces of what must have been dozens of bottles cover the floor.  In the center of the cellar is sprawled the face-down skeleton of a giantman, its spine and several of its ribs cleanly severed.  A set of stone steps lead upward along the east wall."
