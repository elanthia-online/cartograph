  "description": [
    "Suspended from the supports of the large and airy geteld are a pair of bronze lanterns that sway as the canvas sides move with each errant breeze.  A large wooden cot draped with a thick pine green comforter rests upon a thick carpet of ambers and chestnuts hues.  A vine and leaf pattern is etched into the wooden panels of an iron-bound wooden coffer that is set to one side of the structure."
