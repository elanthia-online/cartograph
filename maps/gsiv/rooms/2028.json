    "The beach encircles a small tide-pool left in a depression by the waves.  Hermit crabs scamper around the small body of water, patrolling for delicacies.  Beyond the dunes blocking the pool's reunion with the depths, the foamy remains of breakers recede down the beach with a soft hiss.  Moonlight reflects off of the sand and water, bathing the outcrop of rock in a silvery haze.",
    "The beach encircles a small tide-pool left in a depression by the waves.  Gulls dip and swoop over the small body of water, patrolling for crabs and other delicacies.  Beyond the dunes blocking the pool's reunion with the depths, the foamy remains of breakers recede down the beach with a soft hiss.  Light reflects off of the sand and water, bathing the small drama of the diving birds in a silvery haze."
