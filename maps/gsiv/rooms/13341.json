    "The lane travels between two rows of large maple trees, obviously planted at least a century or two ago judging by their height and expanse.  While Woodland Lane is cobbled, the stones are smooth and very uniform, giving the appearance that each one was sculpted to mesh with its neighbors.  Mounds of large-leafed plants crowd around the foot of the trees, their tall stalks bearing lilac-colored blooms."
