    "A massive, distorted skull looms overhead, the steam vents lying beneath it lending an unearthly semblance of life as sulphorous vapor streams through its vacant eye sockets.  Stringy kelp dangles from its jagged teeth with a scattering of fish bones on the ground below, remnants of the creature's last meal."
