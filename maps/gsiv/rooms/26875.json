    "A round stained glass window patterned with brightly colored flowers appears oddly out of place on the far wall of this cramped space.  Dusty oak planks have been pried up from underfoot, the broken floorboards scattered about, the resulting pitfalls lying in wait for the unsuspecting ankle.  An overturned metal trunk and a cracked glass display case are the only remaining furniture, while a large rat's nest in the corner is quite crowded with various discarded treasures."
