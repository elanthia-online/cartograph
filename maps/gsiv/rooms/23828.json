    "A large twisted chandelier hangs from a coiled chain at the center of the dome-ceilinged room, the candles upon it flickering with a magical, eerie blue light.  Below a massive embossed golvern shield that serves as the room's primary decor, a large canopy bed spans the back wall.  A small sidebar with a slate countertop stands opposite a large stained glass window in the shape of a massive green serpent."
