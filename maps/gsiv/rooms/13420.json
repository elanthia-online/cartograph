    "The thick canopy of the surrounding trees shrouds the northeastern path in utter darkness, not even the light of the sun passing through the shadowy partition of tightly-knit leaves.  A small bridge, crafted of the same pure white cobblestones, arches over a small stream running through the area, its surface chased with intricate eahnor designs.  Long trails of moss hang from the thick branches of the trees arcing overhead, swaying rhythmically every few moments.",
