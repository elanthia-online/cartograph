    "Cool, moist drafts flow in from the north every few moments, the soft currents lending a deep chill to the air.  A single lit torch flickers above, the flame casting wavering shadows upon the encroaching walls of the chamber.  Large stalactites loom overhead, the craggy rock formations releasing tiny droplets of water to collect in shallow pools within the bare, lifeless earth."
