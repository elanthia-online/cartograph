    "The walls glow with a luminous blue light, reflecting off the various religious symbols hanging from the walls. Brother Stumbleskink bustles about, polishing, dusting and generally fussing over his wares.  Despite his busybody attitude, the shop is very peaceful, and you are loathe to speak above a whisper for fear of disturbing the calm."
