    "A realistically rendered portrait of a merchant sailing ship hangs on one of the lacquered black willow walls, and a vaulted black willow ceiling rises overhead.  An open black willow treasure chest with a variety of diamonds heaped to the top sits in one corner of a black-veined white marble floor.  There is a black-accented white marble counter on one side of the shop and a diamond chip-inlaid black willow cabinet on the other."
