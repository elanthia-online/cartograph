  "description": [
    "Sparse patches of brown weeds border the pathway as it continues to follow the north-south direction of the east wall of the keep.  The tracks of a marsh deer cross back and forth over nearby ground, giving wide berth to the partial skeletal remains of a hog.  Beyond the hog skeleton, an animal trail climbs up and over an earthen barrier to disappear into the fens."
