    "An intricate knot-worked wall-hanging hangs on one of the white brocade walls, and a modwir beam ceiling rises overhead.  A wyvern painted ivory vase sits in one corner of a plain cherrywood floor.  There is a carved oak table on one side of the shop and a large cherrywood cabinet on the other."
