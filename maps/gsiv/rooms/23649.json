    "The tavern is somewhat shabby looking, with faded and worn rugs scattered about a scuffed floor and 'seen-better-days' curtains hanging limply at the windows.  Despite its dishabille, however,  it is clean and possesses mouth-watering aromas wafting through from a hidden kitchen.  A few patrons sit at the establishment's low tables talking and laughing, silhouetted by a merry fire crackling in a hearth on the room's back wall."
