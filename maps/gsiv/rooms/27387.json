    "Protected by its crenellated parapet, the alure of the keep stretches between twin turrets, their azure-on-white pennons stark against the night sky.  Below, the inner ward and its guarded buildings fan out, illuminated within the bastioned curtain walls of the stronghold.  Beyond, the dark of the night swallows much of the countryside, save the dancing glows of caravansary campfires nestled below Vornavis' clifftop enceinte and the streetlights of the Freeport of Solhaven, dimly flickering in the night."
