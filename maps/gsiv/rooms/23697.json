    "Placed along the far end of the room, a row of workout wheels groan and creak as their mechanisms turn ready to catch a guild member off guard.  Near the front of room, large sofas rest against the walls, offering respite from the rigors of training, and a small table near the southwestern hallway holds a cold beverage."
