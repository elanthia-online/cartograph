    "Coral trees display their vivid red-orange blossoms as they drape over mistwood rocking chairs at the edge of the garden.  A single spray of water fountains from an otherwise calm pool, sending ripples across its water.  Beneath the surface, koi wander lazily in flashes of gold, orange, and white.  A simple meditation maze frames the pool, wandering in a path defined by bromeliads and anthuriums."
