    "Mullioned glaes windows allow shards of sunlight to enter this corner of the hallway.  Chips of moonstone and quartz imbedded in the walls catch and reflect the light, giving the appearance of stars.  The primary sources of illumination are four spheres suspended from the ceiling, lit from within.  By their colors and size, it is likely that they are meant to represent the moons Liabo, Lornon, Tilaok and Makiri.",
