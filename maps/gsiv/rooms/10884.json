    "Here at the mouth of the river, the rocky beach has given way to sand, only one large boulder marring the warm, golden glow.  It stands as a sentinel, overlooking the river and bay and a narrow sandy point that extends to the west.  Dark shadows behind the boulder seem eerie in the moonlight.  A path leads into the woods.  The distant sound of water birds and the whispering winds fill the air with a joyous song.",

It stands as a sentinel, overlooking the river and bay and a narrow sandy point that extends to the west.  Dark shadows behind the boulder seem to promise relief when the sun's warmth grows too strong.  A path leads into the woods.  The distant sound of water birds and the whispering winds fill the air with a joyous song."
