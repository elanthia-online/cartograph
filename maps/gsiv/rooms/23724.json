    "Wall-to-wall bookshelves enclose this space, their contents carefully ordered.  Across the room from a narrow staircase leading down, a heavy oak desk sits next to a modest cream linen chaise.  Under a small window overlooking the side yard below, a collection of scalpels, bamboo needles, and other implements have been laid out on a low steel table where they await their next use."
