  "description": [
    "Corroded steel weapons racks border a training area with a small, mucky pit in the center.  In lieu of training dummies, disease-blotched corpses have been strapped to several posts nearby, their skin scored with slashes from blades and whips.  Sickly green and wan red pennants festoon the top of each post, stirring occasionally in the cavern's air currents as if mocking the deceased."
