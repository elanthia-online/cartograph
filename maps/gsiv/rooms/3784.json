    "Plush, cerulean carpets spread from wall to wall.  An elegantly carved mahogany desk stands on the center of the carpeting.  Heavy, midnight blue brocade drapes embroidered with the images of silver coins are tied back, allowing a circle of watery moonlight to bathe a patch of the floor.  Etched with tiny winged creatures, a brass flowerpot contains a well-trimmed smastan bush.  A few browned leaves and berries litter the floor.",
