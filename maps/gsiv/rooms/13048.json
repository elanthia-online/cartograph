    "High, corbeled arches give way to elaborately frescoed ceiling partitions, each glorified in hues of majestic purple, grey, and blue.  The floor is highly polished, matching the blue-grey granite common among other Ta'Illistim architecture.  A massive, maoral desk consumes a great portion of the room's far end and beyond it stands an iron-bound door along the southwest wall.  Two guards carefully watch those who pass through the hall."
