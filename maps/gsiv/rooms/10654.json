    "Some predatory ivy is attacking the oak trees, sending thick ropes up the trunks and around the branches.  The ivy's white-veined green leaves soak up the sun, cutting the trees off from their source of energy, and life.  Travel through the area is slowed by the constant need to push the dangling vines out of the way."
