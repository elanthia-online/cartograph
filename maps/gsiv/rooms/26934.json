  "description": [
    "The broad sweep of the hardwood floor is interrupted by a verdant elderberry bush.  Halfway to the cloud-painted ceiling, a framed Ta'Illistim map hangs on one of the smooth sandstone walls.  A narrow glass-topped table and a heavy lead glass display case are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
