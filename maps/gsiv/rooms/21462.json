    "Stacks of wooden boxes and crates line the walls and fill up most of the space in this cramped storage area.  One corner remains vacant, save for a lumpy padded cot and a cushioned bench sitting perpendicular to each other.  A tarnished brass lamp hangs on the wall barely a foot above the cot."
