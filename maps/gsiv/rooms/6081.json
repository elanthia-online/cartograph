    "The land dips slightly, creating a low spot in the wheat fields and collecting more moisture than the surrounding areas.  Mushy ground sucks at feet and boots, attempting to trap anyone moving through the area.  The wheat appears healthy enough, though a little shorter than the wheat in the surrounding areas.  Unseen bullfrogs voice their opinions in deep croaks all around the area."
