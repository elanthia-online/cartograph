    "Beneath an uneven wooden ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  A vine-carved mahogany table and a bamboo rack sit in opposite corners while a worn rug rests on an unfinished wooden floor.",
    "A glass-eyed spotted gak head hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls, and a varnished golden oak ceiling rises overhead.  A bronzed drake sculpture sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a vine-carved mahogany table on one side of the shop and a bamboo rack on the other."
