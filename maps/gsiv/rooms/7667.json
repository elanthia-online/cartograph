    "Standing on a small ledge, you pause for a moment to take in the sight of a subterranean waterfall, tumbling and frothing in the furthest corner of the cave.  There is a large fissure between the boulders that line one of the walls.  Somewhere upstream, a hot spring has merged into the flow, and the water is surprisingly warm.  The room is comfortable, and a pleasant change from the dankness of the outer cave."
