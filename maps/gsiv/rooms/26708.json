    "A wide break in the outer balustrade of the ship is strung with aged gold-linked chains dripping with barnacles, while the waterlogged gangplank lies rotting on the floor.  Opposite the gap, a set of stained glaes double doors hang open, the long ago, bustling market now an aquarium of tropical fish."
