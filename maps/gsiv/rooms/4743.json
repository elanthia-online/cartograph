    "The knobby trunks of old oaks crowd the broken path, their roots cracking the crumbling mortar of the old trail from beneath.  Dry moss grows heavily over the greying bark, and vine-like tendrils creep across the remaining cobblestones.  The branches overheard rustle slightly, their dry leaves whispering through the quiet woods."
