    "Lush foliage and scented blooms surround the terrace, providing a colorful frame for a magnificent view of the bay.  Sunlight sparkles off the distant waters.  Thick vines burst through an open canopy overhead, blanketing the area in a cloud of pale purple flowers.  Feathery ferns rim brick walkways, and red-blossomed trees enfold a stone bench, an elegant statue, and a sculptural fountain.  A large gazebo provides ample space for a band and dancers to gather."
