    "Shiny steel buckets strung by thin twisted ropes hang down from the top of the wall supports to rest against white canvas of the northern and southern walls.  Spattered with a wide range of green shades, the lower half of the western wall shows off a vibrant green landscape which, though filled in with brown, red, yellow, and blue paints, is primarily colored with the green dyes in the buckets."
