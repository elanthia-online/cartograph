    "Sprawled beneath a towering tree, with its boughs home for numerous feathered and furry creatures, rests a massive ebonwood chair and a much plainer oak chair with a round carved table nestled between them.  Well-trimmed grass with a smattering of buttercups ripples lazily on a scarcely felt breeze.  Two piles of rotting apples rest not far from a boulder that vaguely resembles a frog wearing a wide-brimmed hat."
