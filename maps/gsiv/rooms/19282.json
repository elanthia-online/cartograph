    "One slightly tilted table is placed in the center of the room, located over a metal grating inset into the slate-tiled floor.  Glass-fronted cabinets line the walls.  As if an afterthought, several uncushioned and wobbly-looking stools sit near the sagging frame of a wooden door, arranged haphazardly together."
