    "Beneath a basket-woven golden bamboo ceiling, an oil-filled brass sconce hangs on one of the white-washed ash walls.  A glaes-covered wicker display case and a large white wicker basket sit in opposite corners while a white vanilla orchid-filled vase rests on a sweet-scented rush-covered floor."
