    "The interior of the hut isn't very spacious, and the shelter looks to have been abandoned quite some time ago, leaving cobwebs and spiderwebs scattered everywhere.  Along the western wall, countless numbers of shovels lean up against the boarded-up window.  In the center of the hut is a decayed wrotwood coffin."
