    "High ceilings make this room feel larger than it is.  The front hosts brocade armchairs facing a small fireplace.  Over the mantel, a colorful painting is hung.  A dark wood display case cordons off the back of the room.  In one corner, a long oak counter isolates a cast iron stove and a large oak pantry.  A maoral table and an antique wood buffet occupy the other corner.  A set of stained glass doors leads out the back.  A large expanse of windows allow muted sunlight to fill the room.  Near the front door, a tall window provides a view of guests."
