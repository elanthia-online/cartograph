    "The burrow widens and deepens into a natural auditorium here, with rows of dirt benches set up in a semicircle leading to a small stage at the south end.  The walls are stacked with boxes overflowing from the storage outside, and hung with rough woven tapestries that help keep out the chill of the surrounding earth."
