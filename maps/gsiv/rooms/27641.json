  "description": [
    "The landscape of the islet is entirely void of any vegetation and life.  The rocky surface is covered in old bones and small white shells.  A crumbling stone mausoleum is all that stands on the center of the island.  Waves wash up over the shoreline, slowly swallowing the remaining terrain of the islet."
