  "description": [
    "This ample, perfectly circular room is pierced symmetrically by passages leading north and south and doors to the east and west.  Several silk-cushioned divans, slightly arced to match the curvature of the walls, line the walls between.  Richly hued walnut paneling rises to meet the ceiling, a perfect hemisphere of deep ultramarine dotted with tiny gold stars."
