    "Three curving walls of this chamber have been painted with fanciful scenes of merfolk and nymphs sporting among ocean waves and sunswept beaches.  A brilliant sunset depicted on the west wall cleverly frames an arched fireplace.  Midnight blue silk panels, embroidered with tiny silver stars and draped from the ceiling above, sway gently in a warm updraft, creating the illusion of a twinkling night sky.  Centered in the room, a feather bed hangs suspended from the ceiling on cotton ropes."
