    "This portion of the wall was clearly damaged and repaired at some point, most of the stones of the crenellated barrier not matching any in the rest of the keep.  In fact, the material used in repairing the wall doesn't look much like stone at all, rather, it appears to be several irregular pieces of opaque glass that have been marred with clawlike scratches and scrapes."
