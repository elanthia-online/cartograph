  "description": [
    "Someone has attempted to cover the muddy floor with a large ragged cut of rough burlap.  The ceiling's warped rafters sag and bow toward the floor, the worst of which is propped up by a single cracked wooden post.  A dirt-covered lantern hangs low from anther beam, providing a dull amber glow over the area."
