  "description": [
    "A ruined cobbled road rises from the waters of the cold stream and ascends a nearby stream bank.  The tall reeds give way to smaller reeds and grasses that overwhelm the stream and prevent any further passage north.  A gnarled sycamore bends over the stream with pale white limbs draped in hanging moss."
