    "Wooden wagons stand parked along the lane, some empty and some packed with goods brought from market.  A few children carry on a game of stickball on the cobblestones, kicking up clouds of dust that hang in the air.  The thatched cottages that line the street are not luxurious, but lace curtains in the glassless windows and occasional flowerpots lend an air of civility."
