    "A fine mist eddies about your ankles as you enter this quiet niche.  Well-tended herbs and flowers grow in abundance around a pure-white marbled bench, tickling the senses with the scent of hyssop, rosemary, mint and jasmine.  The sound of trickling water draws your eyes to a small grotto cut into a wall of gray rock glistening with moisture.  The grotto shelters a statuette perched upon an ivory altar covered with a pristine sheen of water that drips from an over-hanging rock."
