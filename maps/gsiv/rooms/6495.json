  "description": [
    "The cramped closeness of this area is quite a contrast to the open airy rooms throughout the rest of the monastery.  The low ceiling and close walls give the place a prisonlike atmosphere.  The six squat wooden doors that lead off the hallway reach from ceiling to floor.  The stones in the walls, floor and ceiling here are ill-fitted and uneven."
