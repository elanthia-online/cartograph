  "description": [
    "Odd, curlicued trails and strange slash marks, the tracks of worms and small crabs, are traced in the thick slime that covers the path.  The hum of mosquitoes, black gnats and green-headed flies is constant.  The cordgrass is abundant, crowding the reeds.  A small patch of sea lavender is crowded in amongst the cordgrass, but the small delicately scented flowers fail to soften the deep odor of slowly decomposing vegetation."
