    "Water covers the floor of this cavern, swirling in nearly silent eddies before rushing away to rejoin the Mistydeep River.  Raised stepping stones have been artfully placed, creating a path from east to west with a branch that leads to several doors set into the wall.  The subtle lapping of the water against the stones provides a calm, relaxing atmosphere."
