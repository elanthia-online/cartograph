    "A jetty of waterworn stone juts out into the shallow water of the river delta.  The water is calmer here, but the steady breeze brings with it the scent of the open bay.  Gulls swarm around the end of the promontory, searching for meals in the shallow water, and small cargo ships pass into and out of the river's mouth in a steady stream.",

A few gulls alight around the end of the promontory, searching for meals in the dark, shallow water, and small cargo ships pass into and out of the river's mouth, their lanterns flickering in the dark."
