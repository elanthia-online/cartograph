    "Only wide enough for two or three people to pass each other uncomfortably, the landing gives a view of the magnificent foyer below.  A few small icons hang on the wall to each side of the door set in the middle of the wall.  Carpeting covers the floor, its plush pile dyed a pale eggshell color."
