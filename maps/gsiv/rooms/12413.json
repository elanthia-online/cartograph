    "Woven mats are nailed over the broken front window to keep out the dust of the street.  A scattering of filthy straw serves as a floor covering.  Behind the bar, glasses are stacked haphazardly in the rusted sink.  Giantmen, miners, and dwarves lean against the battered bar, casting a cursory glance at new arrivals.  Barely visible through the rising dust and smoke is a dark curtain, over which hangs a small handwritten sign."
