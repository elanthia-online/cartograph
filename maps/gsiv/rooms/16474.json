    "Open to the air, the cafe is built upon a cobblestone court that is wrapped on one side by a high wall and its other two sides by the sides of the winery.  Twin arches lead back inside, while colorful awnings are stretched across the area to provide protection from the elements for the shoppers that lounge at the various tables and chairs that are arranged in social circles.  A long bar allows customers to sample the various beverages that the winery sells, as well as complimentary snacks."
