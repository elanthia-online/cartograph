  "description": [
    "Carved out of the bedrock, the smoothly finished stone walls in this room form a fitting backdrop for the various contraptions the dwarven crafters have constructed to aid them in their work.  Along the eastern wall stands a low workbench with rows of tool racks against the wall behind it.  Evenly spaced about the room are a grinder, a polisher and a vise, the base of each inlaid with small squares of sandstone."
