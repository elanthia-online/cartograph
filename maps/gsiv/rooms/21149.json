  "description": [
    "High above the auditorium, this box seat provides a perfect view of the stage and its heavy curtain.  Silver accents on the railings and thickly padded marble chairs sparkle in the lamp light as the flames flicker within their glass containers.  Serving trays rest on wheeled carts on the thick burgundy carpet near a rowan door embossed with silver scrollwork leading back outside."
