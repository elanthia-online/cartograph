    "Reddish mahogany bookcases obscure the smooth ebonwood walls that resemble the featureless visage of the famed pyrothag.  Stretched out across the floorboards is a plush, burgundy rug that reaches nearly to the carved molding where the floor and walls meet, leaving a border of dark flooring exposed.  Several overstuffed divans occupy much of the open floor space, with a simple writing desk resting beneath the only window in the room.  A mahogany door leads out to the landing."
