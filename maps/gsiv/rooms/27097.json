    "Lines of ivory foam cling to the edge of the shoreline, intermingling with the strands of flora that flourish on the shore of the lagoon.  The trees framing the lagoon provide some respite from the heat of the sun as the branches of a few extend out over the water to cast shadows over the surface.  A decorated bamboo hut occupying the majority of the shore can be seen as well as a pathway providing a means to travel around the lagoon."
