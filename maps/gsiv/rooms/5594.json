    "Three large tents are grouped around a large firepit here.  The eastern tent is a dull, reddish-brown color.  The southern tent looks brand new and is made of a bright green canvas.  The western tent is a faded blue color, almost grey.  A tall pole stands near the firepit with a coiled whip affixed to the top of it.  A worn footpath leads south between the green and the blue tents."
