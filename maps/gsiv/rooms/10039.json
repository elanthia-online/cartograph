    "Swirling mist nearly conceals the low mound of the ancient barrow that rises on the horizon to the north.  The black dirt of the road is surrounded on both sides by a barren landscape of scrawny, windswept bushes and broken stones, and the fog-shrouded sky is an eternal twilight grey even in daytime.",
