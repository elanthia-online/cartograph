    "The var bends to the north and west as it passes the entrance to Ta'Illistim Keep.  Pure white granite accents the doorway arches and windows, providing a pleasant contrast to the blue-grey granite of the keep's high, buttressed walls.  The rectangular building is flanked on either end by a lofty entryway tower.  Wide, slate steps lead up to carved oak doors, while overhead hangs a sapphire and silver banner embroidered with the Illistim coat-of-arms.",
    "The var bends to the north and west, winding its way around the multi-domed bulk of Ta'Illistim Keep.  Leading into the building is a wide staircase, its grey stone treads and risers flecked with inclusions of hematite.  The peacock of the House Illistim crest is picked out in a silver-on-sapphire mosaic that covers most of the front of the Keep.",
    "The var bends, winding its way between the multi-domed bulk of Ta'Illistim Keep and an open expanse of green that stretches through the middle of the city."
