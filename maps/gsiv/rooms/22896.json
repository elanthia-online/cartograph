    "Thick foliage obscures the surroundings, allowing very little moonlight to creep through the tall, black willow trees.  Standing in the center of a pool of cloudy water is a hollowed tree stump that is covered in orange and brown shelf fungi.  Several patches of land offer a better trail through the deep muck that covers the ground, but avoiding the muck seems impossible."
