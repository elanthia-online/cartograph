    "Thick layers of dust lay undisturbed on the worn stone floor.  Empty iron sconces, evenly spaced around the room, still hang securely from the strong walls.  Rising up through a small opening in the floor, an iron ladder has been bolted to the southern wall and leads to a trapdoor in the ceiling."
