    "Quiet and comfortably out of the way, an ornately carved teak screen sections this small corner off from the larger room and affords some small measure of privacy.  Several low, tone-on-tone ultramarine damask divans form a close semicircle around a burnt bronze velvet wingback chair that faces the lacquered teak partition.  A gold-veined white marble table with clean, elegant lines rests in the center of the well-appointed seating area, and tucked in a corner a tall oval mirror framed with elaborate gold scrollwork stands watch over the secluded space."
