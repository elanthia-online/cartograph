    "Streaming from a central point in the ceiling are lengths of sheer silk in a variety of bold colors.  The silk is embroidered with musical notes in fine golden thread.  Several stands hold scores of music for both instrument and voice, and a crystal display case is filled with practice instruments.  Opposite the rehearsal area is a beautifully carved maoral bar with a deep green marble top, and affixed to the wall behind the bar is a silver-framed sign.  Some bar stools provide a comfortable place to rest."
