  "description": [
    "A wide space has been cleared out behind the wagon, creating a comfortable area in the moonlight.  Several benches and tables have been set out next to a rickety clothing rack, providing ample seating for customers.  A bright yellow awning extends from the side of the wagon, just above a small circular hatch leading back inside."
