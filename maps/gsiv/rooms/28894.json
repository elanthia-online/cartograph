    "Built against the backdrop of the ascending, northerly road, a glaes-windowed stucco storefront faces the stalls, tents, and open-air structures of the market to the east.  A seashell path winds its way from the cobblestone street through the verdant lawn that encircles the tidy structure, its path taking it past a dangling wooden sign.  Dormant glaesine-doored lanterns perched on wrought iron lampposts flank a carved wooden bench that is positioned to watch the foot traffic of the market beyond.",
