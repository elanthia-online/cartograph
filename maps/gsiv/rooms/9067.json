  "description": [
    "Aquariums of various sizes line the walls of the small room, the faint sound of water trickling in each of the tanks filling the air.  A large glass aquarium takes up most of the space in the center of the room, its interior filled to the brim with a variety of fish and aquatic creatures.  A small child sits next to the center aquarium as if she was the tiny sentry for the large underwater domain."
