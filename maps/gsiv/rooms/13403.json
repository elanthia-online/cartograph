    "The arched roof of the building harbors a variety of thin meshed nets with several lures dangling from them.  A large wooden counter stands to the east, and above it are many shelves and racks of various fishing equipment.  A small door leads out toward the back, and the gentle sound of the water sloshing against the pier rhythmically washes over the surroundings."
