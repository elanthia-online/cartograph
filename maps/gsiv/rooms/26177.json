    "Several short trees, their trunks reduced to splinters, block the path to the west and shed bark, leaf, and limb upon the nearby ground.  Piles of dirt, grit, and stone are scattered about the area, creating a mess of organic debris.  Small pools of standing water ripple as the wind passes through."
