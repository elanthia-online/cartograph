    "A pair of sooted lanterns flank the entryway, casting amber illumination in puddles on the floor, though the high-arching ceiling remains in darkness.  Ahead, the path slopes upward, trailed by a carpeted runner that is threadbare in spots and faded in its entirety.  Several small niches are set into the walls at varying heights, and the uneven staggering gives the entryway a slightly off-balance feel."
