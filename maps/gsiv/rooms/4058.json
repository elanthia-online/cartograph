    "The path spreads into an expanse of muddy ground that stretches down to the riverbank.  Dilapidated shacks are built on the drier patches of ground, some resting at slight angles as they sink into the shifting muddy surface.  Seabirds roam the area, squalling loudly as they poke in the wet ground for snails and other goodies."
