    "The octagonal patio is paved with dark riverstones and separated from a surrounding field of wildflowers by a thin cast iron railing.  Light from inside the guild illuminates the patio and dispenses the darkness of the field several feet away from the railing.  A polished wood workbench rests in the center of the patio, while a weathered light wood cabinet sits against the railing, covered in detailed carvings of various herbs and flowers.  In a crack in the floor, a small resilient daisy blooms."
