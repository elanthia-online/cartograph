    "Barely bigger than a closet, the back room is fit with several floor-to-ceiling shelves that house various random objects, from a human skull to a length of twine.  A threadbare carpet covers the dusty wooden floor, and despite its degraded state, it is obvious it was once an opulent decoration.  Affixed to the flame-marred wall, a sconce holds a taper candle that exudes an impotent glow.  A ragged canvas curtain leads out of the room and a single soot-stained window lets in absolutely no light at all from outside."
