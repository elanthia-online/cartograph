    "Shades of violet silk enshroud the ceiling and walls of the western section of pavilion, while the eastern walls are banded with misty grey chainsil.  Dark bamboo supports help the distant ceiling to maintain its conical form, while frosted globes of blown glass dangle throughout the area and illuminate the room in an eerie white glow.  Surrounded by copper censers, a cloth-covered circular table displays a small selection of wares."
