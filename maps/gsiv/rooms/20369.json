  "description": [
    "The wall of fallen rocks terminates at a small underground pool.  Murky and stagnant, the water smells faintly of rotting meat and sewage.  A high stone ceiling rises above the cavern, and patterns of light reflected off the pool dance on its pebbled surface.  The large space is illuminated by glowing green florescence in the water.  A niche in the wall contains several lumpy shapes.  The only way out of this room is a small opening high above the rockslide."
