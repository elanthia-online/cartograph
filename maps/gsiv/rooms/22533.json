    "The scent of cologne lingers in the air, almost suffocating the musty stench of the surrounding bog on the other side of a forest green tent flap.  A dapper mannequin commands the central area of the room, and a long glass display case rests along a side wall.  There is a highly polished door at the back of the room."
