  "description": [
    "A wide stone promenade extends south, the grand houses lining each side rising behind elaborate ironwork gates and arches standing in proud contrast to the smaller homes to the north.  Well-dressed couples stroll back and forth, and a man carrying a fiddle case whistles softly as he walks south towards the central plaza."
