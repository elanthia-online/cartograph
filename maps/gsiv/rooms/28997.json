    "Massive ship wheel chandeliers hang from the sea salt-stained ceiling overhead, the wood of both dark with use and age, but glossy with a thick coat of lacquer.  The entire far wall of the lounge is occupied by a reclaimed wood bar, while half a dozen or so tables are arranged around a central mast erected at the center of the space.  A rope ladder leads up the mast to a crow's nest."
