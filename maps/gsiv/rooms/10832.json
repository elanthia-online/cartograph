  "description": [
    "The bog has almost totally reclaimed the road.  Rushes spring up where once a flat, well-maintained road might have run.  Only here and there do cobblestones still make a wary appearance, fighting to stay on top of the cloying sludge.  So very few of them remain, though, that it often takes careful searching to find the next cobblestone and thus continue in the right direction.  Growls and snarls out in the thicker rushes suggest that there are those that wish the stones could not be found."
