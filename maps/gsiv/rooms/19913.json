    "The trail moves through a stand of tall pines on the sunny hillside, sloping down to the west and turning to a steeper path upwards to the north.  The underbrush is sparse here, and the ground is covered with a soft blanket of fragrant pine needles.  A carved stone bench rests at a gap in the trees, providing a quiet lookout over the walls of the town in the distance."
