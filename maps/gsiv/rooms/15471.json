    "Beneath a black-veined white marble dome painted with a mural of a star-blanketed night, a pair of crossed serrated vultite claidhmores with ruby pommels hangs on one of the mica-flecked black marble walls.  An elaborately carved leaf-shaped black marble table and a detailed ruby-trimmed mithril vault sit in opposite corners while a pair of imposing black-veined white marble tigers rests on a black and white checkered marble tile floor."
