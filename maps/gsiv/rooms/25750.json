    "Spacious and bright, the great room has been furnished with suede-covered seating tooled with a delicate blue feather pattern.  Set inside a shallow recess along the northern wall is a lapis-inlaid door, while the west side has a glossy blue door.  The golden bamboo floor has been inset with diamonds patterns wrought from tanik.  Suspended from the tall ceiling is an enormous wrought iron chandelier with blue coral details, upon which numerous glass votives have been placed."
