    "Dust laden feathery roots hang like filthy banners from the ceiling, casting odd shadows against the floor and walls of the tunnel in the presence of a string of torches.  The faint sound of water lapping against a shoreline echoes down the passageway, accompanied by a strong, cool breeze carrying with it the moist scent of muddy earth."
