  "description": [
    "A gaping crevice in the ceiling of this chamber provides a natural chimney to the outside, thus making this room the ideal choice for use as the kitchen.  Several hard clay ovens can be seen and the smell of baking lichen bread eminates from each one.  Cauldrons of shopai and mushroom stew bubble noisily over the fire pit that burns near the chimney."
