    "A glimmer of sunlight can be seen to the northeast, but the forest here is dark and thick, and little light seeps through the heavy canopy of trees.  The air is heavy with the scent of jasmine growing among the small houses that stand scattered through the woods, and a raven cries somewhere in the distance."
