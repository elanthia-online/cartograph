  "description": [
    "Supported by branches that pierce the planks of the platform, the living walls of the hut are formed of woven rosewood limbs, twigs and leaves.  From the roof of the hut hang clusters of firefly-covered seed pods that provide a pale, golden-green light that fills the hut.  Beside the door rests a woven basket containing several items, while along the far wall sets of armor are draped over a low-hanging branch.  In the center of the hut an over-sized toadstool bears an assortment of animal head helmets."
