  "description": [
    "A torrent erupts from the face of the plateau several hundred feet below.  Clear, sparkling water pours out of a chasm and cascades to the low mountain range below, drifting off to the southeast as a silver ribbon.  Though the river appears to provide ample water, no trees dot the river's edge as far as the eye can see.  The chasm itself yawns before you a hundred feet wide, effectively blocking progress along the plateau's edge to the west.",

Clear, sparkling water pours out of a chasm and cascades to the low mountain range below, drifting off to the southeast as a blue ribbon.  Though the river appears to provide ample water, no trees dot the river's edge as far as the eye can see.  The chasm itself yawns before you a hundred feet wide, effectively blocking progress along the plateau's edge to the west."
