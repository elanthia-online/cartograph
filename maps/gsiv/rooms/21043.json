  "description": [
    "Dirt crumbles near the cliff's edge as the trail comes to a sudden halt, giving a breathtaking view of the valley floor below.  A few shrubs and trees cling for life in the rocky soil, waiting for the next rain to wash them down the sparsely vegetated hillside.  Colorful birds of blue and yellow fly above the misty canopy of green below, their screeches resonating throughout the area."
