    "This section of granite has a distinctive brown hue.  The walls have been carved to resemble a grove of elm trees, with thick wavy trunks and arm-like branches that reach up toward the stony sky.  Some trick of perspective half convinces you to walk between the boles and wander into the distance--but just in time you reconsider and spare yourself a bonk on the nose."
