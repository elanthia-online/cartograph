    "The path runs along a steeply inclined bank to the east and northeast here.  The bank, which is dotted by occasional rock outcroppings,  runs along the path for some distance, creating a ridge line that runs parallel to the path.  The earth of the bank is soft, and crumbles making it impossible to climb."
