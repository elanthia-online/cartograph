    "A stagnant pool sits beneath a rocky overhang covered in a sickly orange-green slime.  The accumulated moisture oozes down the slime formation, leaving miscolored droplets underfoot.  The occasional unseen figures journeying in the darkness cause a strange crunching sound as they pass.",
    "Large and small boulders, arranged in a haphazard pile and covered in a sickly orange-green slime, stand out along the edge of tenacious foliage that struggles for dominion over the area.  A stagnant pool sits beneath, its accumulated moisture oozing down the slime formation and leaving discolored droplets in its wake.  A collection of unoccupied snail shells litters the pathway, crunching underfoot as any pass by.",
