  "description": [
    "The domed sea glass ceiling lends an airy feel to the small room.  The emerald silk walls are bare except for a large hammered imflass dragonfly that spans the western wall.  A round table draped with pale jade silk rests upon a finely woven circular rug that covers much of a shell-inlaid ceramic floor, and the corners are each softened by a small pile of jewel-toned silk pillows."
