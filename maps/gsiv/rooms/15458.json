    "A wrinkled parchment gown pattern hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a mistwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a glass-covered box case on one side of the shop and a long carved oak counter on the other."
