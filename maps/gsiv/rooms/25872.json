    "Providing a stunning view of the western grounds, tall, narrow segmented windows allow moonlight to filter in.  Heavy ivory grape leaf-patterned drapes frame the windows, providing warmth to the pale grey stone walls.  A matching fringed rug lies centered on the villswood floor, gracing a smooth rectangular lor table and chairs, while a carved cherrywood hutch stands beside an opening in the north wall leading to the kitchen."
