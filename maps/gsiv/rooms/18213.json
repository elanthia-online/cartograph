    "Simple but comfortable cots line the walls.  At one end is a medical station with a cabinet containing herbs, potions and other medical supplies.  Low windows which are cracked open to allow a cool breeze to pass through the room, give the place a fresh aroma of flowers and plants.  Birds can be heard chirping in nearby trees."
