    "A pair of ebonwood doors loom to the south, their surfaces inlaid with abstract patterns of malachite.  Faint drafts waft in from outside, lending a slightly chilly countenance to the air.  The surroundings are made of drab grey granite polished to a fine luster.  Small designs of twining ivy wrap around the borders of the simple architecture, adding a decorative yet solemn touch to its uniform appearance."
