  "description": [
    "Arched windows are set into the far wall, allowing the pale fingers of light to brush each contour of the workroom.  A transparent glass alembic sits on a small granite workbench that is in one corner, the glass glinting in the light.  An unusual lattice frames the doorway, its loose key pattern allowing the slender tendrils of ivy to wind up its length."
