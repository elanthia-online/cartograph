    "This room is exceptionally dark and casts oddly shaped shadows from the fire in the main hall.  You feel soft fur underneath your feet as you move about.  Parts of the room are pitch black and you make more noise than you would like as you stumble about bumping into the walls and kicking around scrap pieces of iron."
