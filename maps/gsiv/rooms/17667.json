  "description": [
    "Open crates are stacked on open crates and barrels, filled with miscellaneous items from weapons to women's clothing.  Sem leans at the back of the store, carefully cleaning his fingernails with a large dirk.  A sign hangs above his head, \"All items legally salvaged,\" the reading in apparent contrast to the mint and fine condition of much of the merchandise.  In the corner, rests a small crystal ball set atop a crate of hay, the object of fascination for children wandering in and out of the shop."
