    "Dark red satinwood paneling covers the bottom half of the walls, while the top half is painted a pale cream hue.  Sconces of polished brass hang on the wall, and a hammered tin ceiling displays an elaborate scene of hunters cornering their quarry.  A long runner of animal hides pieced into a repeated compass rose pattern ends at each of the three doors opening off of the area, while the staircase is left bare for its craftsmanship to shine."
