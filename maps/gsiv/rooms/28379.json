    "The stone walls of the chamber are tinted a deep tone of azure, complementing the sapphire colored velvet drapes framing a large leaded-glass window.  On the wall opposite is a mosaic, its tiles masterfully designed to depict an ocean view.  Indigo patches of water alternate with cerulean waves, sunlight flickering from their dancing froth.  A pile of lapis-toned pillows is piled between the bed and a generous hearth."
