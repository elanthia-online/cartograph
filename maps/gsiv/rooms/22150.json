    "Perched on the very edge of Solhaven Bay, the manor's back garden lies cradled in a lush riot of brilliant foliage.  Above, the endless cataract of the Cascade of Tears tumbles into the bay with a roar that vibrates the air even as it is muted by the abundant greenery.  Breezes waft curtains of fine mist through the garden, accumulating moisture upon the petals of myriad colorful blooming flowers as well as the canopy of leaves that shelters a large hammock strung between two spreading magnolia trees."
