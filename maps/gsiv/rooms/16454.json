  "description": [
    "The curving marble walls of the expansive, circular chamber enclose a dozen immaculately-kept worktables at which an equal number of meticulously-groomed halfling and human draftsmen labor at their inks and papers.  A tall dark elf, his waist-length black hair intricately braided and his gem-clasped robes shifting in the light from the glaes skylight above, moves about the tables, whispering instructions to the draftsmen."
