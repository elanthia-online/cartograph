    "Interlocking grey stones stretch from wall to wall of this chamber, complimenting the thick crimson velvet drapes that frame the open windows.  A bloodwood desk with an oversized chair sits in one corner.  A black wolf skin rug is stretched out on the floor, with two identical chairs placed on either side.  Facing the marble fireplace, a black leather couch provides a comfortable place to enjoy its warmth.  Hanging above the mantle is a small tapestry.  You also see an oak bin and a griffin-shaped dart board."
