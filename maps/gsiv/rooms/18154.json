    "A triad of heavy wrought-iron chandeliers hang from thick chains, casting their gloomy light across the massive marble table that dominates the entire room.  Many chairs surround the rectangular table, each uniform and simple in design.  Dark crimson banners flutter along the high walls, their silken surfaces bearing the design of a transparent hand upon a field of crimson, the starry void of the night shining through the hand."
