    "The faintly blue, almost undine luminescence of lichens festooning the tunnel's supports and lining the rock walls contrasts sharply with the warmly familiar radiance of widely-spaced lanterns.  Niches between the beams hold a few scattered mining tools, some in good condition and others nearly rusted away.  The tunnel widens to the northeast."
