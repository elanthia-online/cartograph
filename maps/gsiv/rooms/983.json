    "Three roads converge to flow in a donut shape around a large stone well.  On the outside edges of the roads, small commercial structures huddle closely together as if trying to keep warm against the constant frigid wind.  Lights glowing from upper windows indicate that these buildings are used as residences as well as places for conducting business.  An occasional lone house interrupts the rows of shops, but it is apparent that this is the heart of the commercial district.",
    "Three roads converge to flow in a donut shape around a large stone well.  On the outside edges of the roads, small commercial structures huddle closely together as if trying to keep warm against the constant frigid wind.  The businesses are well maintained and, for the most part, gaily painted in various shades of blue and green.  An occasional lone house interrupts the rows of shops, but it is apparent that this is the heart of the commercial district."
