    "A small stream of brackish water flows in a narrow channel along the eastern base of the wall and disappears into a narrow crevice there, its gentle trickling sound echoing faintly through the cavernous chamber.  Bits of greenish mold have colonized the tiny ledges around the water, their slippery forms glistening in the dim light."
