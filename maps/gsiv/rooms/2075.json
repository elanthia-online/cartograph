  "description": [
    "This must have been the main square of the village.  The charred remains of a large fountain occupy the center of the area, rising up from a rectangular pool brimming with stagnant, soot-filled water.  A statue that once rose gracefully from the center of the fountain is now a twisted, blackened mockery of its former beauty.  Large stone buildings border the square, but even though they are still standing, they did not escape the fire unscathed."
