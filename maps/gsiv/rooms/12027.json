    "A huge pedestal of gold-veined blue marble rests at the northeast corner of the plaza.  A pair of heroic legs stretches up toward the sky but come to an abrupt halt at the point where a mighty hand rests on an equally massive hip.  All features above the waist of the statue have sheared off, as if sliced by a mighty sickle."
