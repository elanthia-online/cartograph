    "Four small columns of lustrous marble mark each corner of the expansive office, while sweeping crimson curtains drape across the long, arched window set into the southern wall.  Rays of rippling golden light shine upon the interior of the sparsely decorated office, its glare softly diffused by the silk of the curtains.  A large black desk is set in the center of the room, its surface covered with various neatly piled stacks of paper, and a haphazard arrangement of used quills.",
