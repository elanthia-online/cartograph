    "A long granite-topped table stands as the focal point of the room.  A few work stations provide a place for practical instruction and research, while shelves and cupboards hold an array of seemingly unrelated items, tools, and ingredients.  In the corner, a box of alembics, mortars, and pestles stands next to a brass-framed mirror."
