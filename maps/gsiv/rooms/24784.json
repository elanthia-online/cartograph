    "Cool and slightly damp, the room is sparsely furnished.  Oil lamps hanging from brass wall-hooks compliment a small, sturdy table currently littered with scraps of leather and various leatherworking tools.  A large oak chest stands open on the floor next to the table.  Two square holes penetrate the wall opposite the door, a modwir T-perch placed within six feet of each one."
