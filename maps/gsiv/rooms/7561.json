  "description": [
    "This section of the tunnel ends in a narrow cul-de-sac which is filled with water.  A narrow crack allows for minimal drainage that just manages to keep ahead of the inward flow.  Small ripples dance across the surface of the water as the occasional drop from overhead breaks the surface with a small splash."
