  "description": [
    "Resembling silent sentinels, dormant lanterns perch upon wrought iron posts along the edges of an open-air market filled with multi-colored tents and wagons, while painted cobblestones of black, azure, and cerulean form a clear border between the grey streets that stretch west and south.  A bright blue awning supported by sturdy oak posts stands open and inviting near the northeastern edges.  A small A-framed sign rests just off of its entry proclaiming its services."
