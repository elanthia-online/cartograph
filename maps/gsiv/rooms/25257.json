    "Peridot and sandstone tiles weave across the floor in a patchwork design.  Entire swatches of ground are crusted with dried blood and shriveled bits of gore.  A small ebonwood table sits between two etched bronze candlebras, the light from the waxy candles casting a subtly shifting blanket of shadows along the back wall.  The hiss of the flames is constant and reproachful."
