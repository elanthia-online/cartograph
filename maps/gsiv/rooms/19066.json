  "description": [
    "The longboat is constructed of polished white planks traversed with butter-yellow oak ribs.  Diffused light permeates the canvas tarp covering the boat -- and you -- creating a cozy enclosure, albeit a low-ceilinged one.  A rope ladder drapes over the edge of the boat.  The halfling sitting here appears to be quite at home.  He bends over a small object, totally engrossed, while his hands work over it so rapidly it's hard to follow their progress.  His busy eyebrows dance in league with his flying fingers.",
