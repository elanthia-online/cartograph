    "Grime-covered portholes allow a modicum of light to sift in, revealing a fine haze of dust that drifts down through cracks in the warped deck overhead.  Wrought iron chains, each ending in black metal lanterns, dangle from exposed oaken beams over a long table that is bolted to the deck.  Flanking the table are two rough benches heavily scarred with claw marks.  Scattered upon every surface are half-eaten, moldy chunks of bread, fish, and eel."
