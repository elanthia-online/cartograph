    "Crumbling statues and a lack of sufficient lighting make travel through the temple challenging.  Overhead, an enormous enormous sphere of polished grey moonstone, indicative of the moon of Lornon, hangs precariously on a single linked steel chain and spins erratically as currents of chilled air gust through this area of the temple."
