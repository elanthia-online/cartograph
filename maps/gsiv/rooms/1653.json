  "description": [
    "The trail, barely wide enough for two people to walk abreast, wends its way between the creek and an enormous, kidney-shaped boulder.  Weeds and thistles grow along the bottom of the rock face.  A small rivulet of water trickles down the side of the boulder, joining the quick-flowing creek."
