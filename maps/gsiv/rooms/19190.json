    "A crusty old halfling huddles on a low stool, industriously mending a bright red sock.  His face is so deeply creased and lined, it brings a prune to mind.  Behind him hangs a modwir door adorned with a masterful carving depicting a halfling with a spyglass in hand, perusing the far horizon.  A curling feather on his hat sweeps down and circles the shiny brass doorknob."
