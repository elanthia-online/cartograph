    "The cool, damp air makes you shiver, as the ruined walkway bends northwest, away from the castle.  The overgrown hedges have gone completely wild, nearly blocking the path.  To the northwest, through the shreds of mist, you get a glimpse of an old stone building that appears to be in fair shape, all things considered."
