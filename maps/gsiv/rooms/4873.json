  "description": [
    "The passage through the trees is littered with stones and choked with densely grown underbrush.  Liana festoons the lower branches of the ancient trees which tower above you, the vines thicker than the trunks of some of the youngest trees.  The spicy scent of oak leaves only imperfectly masks a sharper animal smell.",

The spicy scent of oak leaves only imperfectly masks a sharper smell, and distant animal cries are a sure sign that you are not alone."
