    "Halfway between the two cliff headlands that shelter the beach, this crescent midpoint is peacefully quiet except for the muffled thunks of shovel blades hitting the sand.  Small piles of the fine black granules are mounded alongside deep holes, some of which are empty and abandoned, while flickering torches reveal only the heads of their occupants in the other holes.",
