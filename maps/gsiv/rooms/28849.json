    "Barrels and crates are stacked high on the dock, redolent with the smells of salt and pickling spices.  A small barge is moored to the docks with dingy lines, its deck accessible via a warped oaken gangplank.  Sailless, the barge looks sleek and is painted a sharp green, though curls of flaking paint at the waterline suggest that the river has taken a toll on the vessel."
