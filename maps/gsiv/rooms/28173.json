    "Scattered with pale white sand, the footing beneath the airy silk tent is warmed by the sun overhead.  Textiles are piled high on long wooden tables, while crowded beneath are open trunks packed with various sundries.  Baskets brimming with wares hang from the tent poles above wire cages filled with small animals, and a brass hanging censer fills the air with a smoky, exotic aroma."
