    "The trail continues to wrap itself around the mountain, collaring the eastern peak.  The peak looms directly above you, just out of reach from the trail.  Sheer stone walls make the climb to the peak from here impossible, but you can make out a narrow winding trail that reaches the peak to the southeast."
