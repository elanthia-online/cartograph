  "description": [
    "Aside from the far granite wall that bears an opening leading to the catacomb tunnels, the rest of this room is lined with pale travertine carved into displays of elven life and practice, their small figures engaging in a variety of tasks, worship, and repose.  Pink marble rosettes inlaid near the ceiling and floor document the archaic local flora, and spigots of glaes protuding about waist-high feed slow streams of water to a tiny hole in the floor."
