  "description": [
    "This low, sodden patch of ground is bare of trees and heather, as if the vegetation had made an effort to avoid taking root here.  The weathered bones and skulls of elves and humans and dogs and unidentifiable monstrous creatures lie scattered around the cheerless landscape, as if they had lain undisturbed for centuries amid tufts of windblown grass.  A narrow trail leads into the deep woods that form the western edge of the field."
