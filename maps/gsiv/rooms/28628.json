  "description": [
    "A hearth of twisted fel tree trunks takes up most of the wall opposite the door.  The fire within casts its ruddy glow about the room, adding an almost lifelike cast to the carving of the red fox guarding a basket of acorns near it.  Across from the fireplace stands a six-legged desk, the smooth front broken only by a single long drawer.  A travel-worn cloak lies strewn across the bed, partially obscuring the muted tapestry spread beneath."
