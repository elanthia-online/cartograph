    "Thick trees carved from fallen brethren stand like sentinels on the mossy floor of this room.  The ceiling is painted to resemble the green, leafy canopy of a real forest.  The sound of birdsong in the trees and the smell of patchouli enriches the experience of just having stepped into a vast forest.  Several specimens stand in individual glass cases amidst the trees, each labeled with a small bronze plaque."
