  "description": [
    "Sturdy, polished teak poles driven straight into the ground support a thick, stretched canvas tent that encloses this space.  Candles of assorted colors occupy spherical lanterns hanging from several of the poles, their wavering lights casting a pale yellow luminescence upon the goods for sale.  Footprints on the ground mark a faint path between the northwest and southeast corners of the temporary establishment, while a neatly sewn flap leads out.  A sign on a thick wooden stake is posted prominently in the center of the area."
