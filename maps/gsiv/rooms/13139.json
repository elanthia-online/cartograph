    "Spartan enough to make a Vaalor elf proud, the interior of the office is empty but for a single cot, a collapsible field desk, and a chest opened to reveal numerous pigeon holes filled with scrolls, maps, and other papers.  A banner hangs on one wall, opposite two large windows made of double arches and set with a wide wooden sill."
