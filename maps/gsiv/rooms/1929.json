    "The walls of the canyon loom overhead.  The street continues inside them to the east, entering a vast, dimly-lit tunnel.  Dwarves and other folk wander in and out, some stopping at a small, bright-blue wooden shop here outside.  A thick plume of black smoke puffs silently out of the shop's chimney and the faint smell of burning bread wafts throughout the street."
