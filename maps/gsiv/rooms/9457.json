  "description": [
    "Noticeably warmer than its neighbors, this shop features an assortment of heat sources on display around the area.  A wrought iron stove radiates heat in the far corner, its fire tended to by a dwarven attendant.  A polished bell and a stack of papers sit atop a raised rock slab serving as a desk along the back wall."
