    "A canopy of low gingko trees shades this small area, their branches intertwining to cast a mottled carpet of dark and light patches on the turf below.  A life-size human mannequin swathed in several layers of bandages, splints, and tourniquets leans against one of the tree trunks.  Several empty cots offer places for treatment of the badly wounded.  Wooden cabinets hold a small emergency supply of medicinal ingredients in various shapes, sizes, and potencies."
