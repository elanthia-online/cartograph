  "description": [
    "A low metal railing surrounds the circular topmost level of the lighthouse without obscuring the view of the surroundings.  In the center of the space, a large fire pit rests in an iron retaining bowl to prevent the signal fires from spreading to the weathered wooden planks of the deck.  A bundle of thick wooden sticks rests in a basket nearby, and several fire tending tools reside in an iron rack.  Sitting atop a low table near the railing is a small earthenware bowl, while a narrow set of stairs leads downward through a rectangular hole in the floor."
