    "The trail ends in a redoubt created by immense formations of ice.  Snow rains down in sheets, like a frozen waterfall cascading down from above in slow motion.  What remains of the trail meanders down to the northeast, fraught with dangerous patches of ice and irregular outcrops of stone, which wait for an unwary footfall to offer up disaster."
