    "Reigning supreme over this one room cabin is a large stone fireplace built both for ease of cooking and heating of the entire room.  Near the fireplace is a small stack of wood, already split and ready to feed a hungry fire.  Pegs line the other walls, conveniently placed to hang cloaks and packs, freeing the limited floor space for other uses."
