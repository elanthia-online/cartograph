    "From the great height afforded by this vantage point, the dark expanse of the Lake of Fear reflecting the light of the stars, can be seen over the parapet.  The strong basalt ramparts below provide ample protection from whatever might emerge from the wilds.  A long forked pole rests across two hooks on the parapet."
