    "A fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the painted black oak walls, and an ivory stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A bronzed drake sculpture sits in one corner of a golden blonde oak floor.  There is a lacquered wooden shelf on one side of the shop and a dovetailed oak table on the other."
