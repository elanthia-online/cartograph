  "description": [
    "A small wooden dock juts out into the center of the frozen pond where a hole has been carved into the ice, providing access to the fish deep below.  A rhimar-lined chest sits beside a large fallen limb that is carved with a scene of two friends fishing from a dock.  A sizable slug appears to be making its way slowly across a large nearby rock.  A pair of lor trees guard a curved path of small snowberry bushes covered in a thin frost."
