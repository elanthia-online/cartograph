  "description": [
    "Draped in deep plum velvet swathes of fabric, and scattered with multicolored overstuffed cushions, the alcove serves as a vibrant area for creative work to take place.  Cotton threads and flower petals are strewn across a thick oak desk and the surrounding floor space, and half made garments and flower arrangements lay haphazardly around the room."
