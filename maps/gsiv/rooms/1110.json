    "A huge basalt plateau looms just to the east.  It is an edifice of sheer rock pushing hundreds of feet into the air.  The trail climbs the side of the tower, somehow finding a path until it reaches the top.  Although it looks like a tough climb, it is the only marked trail leading to the east.  The trail continues northwest, approaching a group of trees and then up into the barren hills.  The route into the hills looks a bit easier than the plateau route, but not much."
