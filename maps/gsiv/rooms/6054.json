    "Parallel rows of tall corn stalks march off to the west.",
    "Parallel rows of tall corn stalks march off to the west.  Their glossy, dark leaves wave lazily in the warm breeze, and their tops bend back and forth only slightly.  No ears yet adorn the stalks, and only a few of the stalks extend grainy tassels toward the sky.  The corn stalks are spaced only half a foot apart in the rows, creating a dense grey curtain when viewed from the north.  Each row is two feet from the next, giving the effect of parallel vegetation channels when viewed from the east.",
