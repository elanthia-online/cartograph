    "Not much more than a closet, the floor is strewn with tea leaves, the heady herbal aroma overpowering behind the closed door.  Partially concealing the room's only window, a stack of wooden crates reaches nearly to the ceiling.  A soft meowing can be heard coming from behind a woven basket in the corner."
