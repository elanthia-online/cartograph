    "A huge, gnarled oak tree has forced its way over the crumbling remnants of the city wall.  It sits enthroned atop the mound of its fallen enemy with branches spread in exultant glory.  Oaken descendants cluster about it, like children at a grandsire's knee, creating a barrier as impenetrable as the conquered wall."
