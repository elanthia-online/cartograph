    "The southern half of the guild's lounge is visible through the open doorway to the east, although it appears primarily empty at this time of day.  Directly south of the lounge entrance, a small round window allows a few rays of sunshine to slip through the decorative wrought iron that protects the glass from the outside.",
    "The southern half of the guild's lounge is visible through the open doorway to the east, and occasional cheers and jeers can be heard within.  Directly south of the lounge entrance, a small round window looks out through a decorative wrought iron covering into the darkened city streets."
