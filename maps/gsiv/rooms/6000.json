    "A rectangular plot of earth, once set aside for use as a small garden, has been overrun by ravenous grasses, its short dirt borders no longer safe from the encroaching grasslands.  The broken vestiges of a meager fence surround some sections of the garden, but the overgrown grass and weeds make it very difficult to tell where the small furrows and neatly planted crops may have once lain.  To the southeast, the burnt remains of a farmhouse stand out against the dim night sky.",
    "A rectangular plot of earth, once set aside for use as a small garden, has been overrun by ravenous yellow grasses, its short dirt borders no longer safe from the encroaching grasslands.  The broken vestiges of a meager fence surround some sections of the garden, but the overgrown grass and weeds make it very difficult to tell where the small furrows and neatly planted crops may have once lain.  To the southeast, the burnt remains of a farmhouse stand in stark contrast to the auburn hue of the meadow."
