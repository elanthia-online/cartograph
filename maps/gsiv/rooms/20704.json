  "description": [
    "Lit by a single candle that rests atop each of several tables, the room is dim and faintly scented with fresh linen and patchouli.  A plush gold rug covers the birch floor and muffles the sounds of footfalls.  Scattered atop the rug are a few soft ivy-patterned sofas, each one paired with a carved cherrywood end table.  Set in one cream-hued wall, a rounded oak arch leads out of the room, the opening flanked by palms set in dark green marble planters."
