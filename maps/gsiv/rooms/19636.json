    "The mahogany flooring here is scuffed, especially a several yard area directly in front of a gold-edged rosewood dart board set with thin sapphire rings.  Comfortable couches and chairs are scattered about at safe distances from the dart board and its flight path.  A scrap of vellum has been nailed to the wall."
