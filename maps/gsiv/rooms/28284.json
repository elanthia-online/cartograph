    "This small room is utilitarian in design, clearly prizing function over form.  There are three very small windows, near the ceiling of the recessed space, and each is covered with iron bars.  The reinforced door has an iron plate covering most of its surface.  The one concession to comfort appears to be some comfortable chairs interspersed around the room."
