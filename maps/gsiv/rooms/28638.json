  "description": [
    "Candles too numerous to count line the walls, filling the air with their heady and almost seductive scent.  A black wrought-iron four poster bed dominates the room, dark green silk tapestries hanging from the sides.  A fire burns quietly in the fireplace, and hung over the mantle is a portrait of Noi'sho'rah.  The floor is made of pure black obsidian, inset with a circle of copper.  Strange runes surround the circle, compelling to both the eye and the mind."
