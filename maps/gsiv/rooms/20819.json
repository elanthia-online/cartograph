    "Rough stones cover this end of the cavern, encircling the deep pool of water.   Off to one side the stream widens into a bubbling mud pool.  Steam and bubbles indicate the presence of thermal heat generated by hot springs nearby.  The lichen on the rocks lighten the area and turn it into an inviting relaxing retreat."
