  "description": [
    "A disheveled skeleton lies in a tangle of roots and vines, and patches of bluish-green mold and mildew are visible on the shredded remains of its clothing.  A gut-wrenching stench seems to be coming from small crevices in the ground that are filled with a greenish, bubbling goop.  Under the light of the moon the goop appears to shimmer.  The air thickens with moisture as dense fog blankets the ground and rises steadily.",
