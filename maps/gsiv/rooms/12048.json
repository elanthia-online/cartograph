  "description": [
    "A massive oak tree grows across the rock-strewn path, branches spreading out in regal glory in all directions, acorns dispersed in profuse abundance about its base.  Scattered up the side of the hill are a few oak saplings, twisted and bent, like the unnourished offspring of a prolific, but uncaring despot."
