    "The broad sweep of the carpeted floor is interrupted by a tiered alabaster fountain.  Halfway to the steeply angled ceiling, an ornate silver samite tapestry hangs on one of the hung silk walls.  A slender silvery glaes display and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
