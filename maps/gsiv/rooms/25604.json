  "description": [
    "The small alcove created by an impressively carved screen is occupied by a heavy teak table that rivals the screen in its masterful workmanship.  A potted palm helps hide the table from view, its fronds swaying slightly at the touch of breeze created by an overhead ceiling fan.  Around the table's perimeter sit a number of high-backed chairs, their seats covered with grey leather."
