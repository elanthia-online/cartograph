    "Bustling activity enlivens this room as cooks prepare the day's fare.  The clanking of pots and pans rings through the air, while the scents of delicious consumables cooking permeates the area.  Steel-topped tables in the center of the room are laden with trays of food waiting to be served, while several fireplaces house fowl roasting on spits.  The wooden door that leads back outside is flanked on both sides by paintings on the wall."
