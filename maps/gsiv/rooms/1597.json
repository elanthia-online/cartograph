    "This section of the avenue is paved with alternating red granite blocks and green-glazed bricks, and a low, red granite wall borders the street's south side.  Rising to twice the wall's height, twin gateposts bear green enamelled wisps of smoke, and a garden filled with pale blossoms and neatly-trimmed shrubs is visible beyond them.",
