  "description": [
    "An intricately woven Loenthran carpet covers the center of the polished haon floor.  The walls are draped in lush, ivory silk that shimmers in light cast from a glimmering glaesine chandelier suspended from the rafters.  Garlands of delicate pink roses intertwined with deep green ivy and strands of tiny pearls bedeck the sales counter, scenting the air with a lovely fragrance.  An engraved silver sign advertises the shop's bridal fashions and a velvet curtain leads to the back room."
