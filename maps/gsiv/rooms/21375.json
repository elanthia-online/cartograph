    "Four, shiny green walls enclose this small shop, which holds the heavy, thick scent of fresh paint.  Customers browsing the shop occasionally break into a fit of coughs when they get too close to one of the walls.  A green duck-shaped shelf has been nailed above a woven basket, filled with eggs and twigs.  Near the shop's exit, the painted green door has been recently splattered with yolk."
