  "description": [
    "Cobblestones make up the road surface at the western end and progressively get larger as the street advances to the east, eventually reaching flagstone size.  Snow, sleet, and ice is packed firmly between the rocks, making the roadbed rather solid, similar to a beam joint used in housing construction.  Skates and sled runners can hardly make a dent in the hard surface, making high speeds very easy to reach."
