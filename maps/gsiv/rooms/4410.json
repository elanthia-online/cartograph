    "Abundantly plain and drab, the floor of the shop is nothing more than plank boards set in place with tarnished nails.  Similarly, old, grey pieces of tongue-and-groove board comprise the walls, which are adorned with naught but a scattering of iron-mounted torches.  Soot and ash cling to the ceiling, discoloring the wood and infusing the entire area with the lingering aroma of smoke."
