    "Scattered over the tile floor, several sturdy bamboo tables take up the entire length of the room.  Each table is set with various tools and ingredients for creating dyes, their surfaces covered in variegated hues of powders and liquids that have yet to be cleared away.  Several individuals congregate around the table near a large side window, alternating their attention between peering at the colored smoke outside and grinding away at bits and pieces of ripe, red teaberries with mortars and pestles."
