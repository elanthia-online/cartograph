    "The road beneath your feet is made of grey stone, polished smooth and slick save several deep gouges in each cobble.  Looking more closely, the scratches form words...names of those beloved to you.  With a start, you realize the cobbles are not paving stones after all, but headstones, laid flat to create a path of the dead."
