  "description": [
    "Two frosted statues have been carved out of the back wall of the room, seeming to melt out of the ice.  One is of a woman with hair blowing wildly about her.  The other appears to be a large pair of feathered wings, two impassive eyes looking out from just above where the wings cross.  Other than the statues, however, the room is made of plain ice."
