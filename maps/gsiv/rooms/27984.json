    "A rich mahogany table dominates this beautifully wainscoted room, its surface intricately carved and painted to recreate the geography of the Turamzzyrian Empire.  An array of colorful glass flacons sit at different points on the table like monument markers.  A single candelabra shines a light across the table, casting shadows along its surface like a setting sun."
