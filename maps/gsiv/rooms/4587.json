    "A considerable-sized, oval-shaped, lacquered table with matching chairs dominates the center of the room.  Standing in the middle of the table is a fair-sized jade and gold vase that is overflowing with purple monkey flowers.  A roaring fire blazes within the fireplace, casting deep shadows along the walls and marble floor.  Built-in bookcases are filled with dusty leather-bound tomes."
