    "Two supple canver trees have grown together over the path, their crowns having met and intertwined to form a lush green arch.  Clumps of their distinctive pink-throated white flowers bloom among the branches, occasionally drifting down to carpet the ground.  The greenery along the path contrasts vividly with the golden brown tones of the desert aviary visible through the glaes wall of the dome.",
    "Two supple canver trees have grown together over the path, their crowns having met and intertwined to form a lush green arch.  The edges of the path are bordered by square, glass-paned lanterns hanging from low stakes.  The lanterns cast long rectangles of light along the path, revealing the contrast of the golden brown tones of the desert aviary within the dome and the pink canver blooms and green grass outside the dome."
