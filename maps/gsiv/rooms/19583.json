    "Protected beneath a bright awning of indigo and vermilion, the area is encircled by wild flowers and verdant foliage.  Several wooden dummies, each padded and tall, are spread throughout the area and poised in different aggressive positions and flanked by large posters in bamboo frames.  Near the southern end of the clearing, a pair of painted screens creates a secluded area that is clean and private."
