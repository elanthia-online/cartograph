    "At first glance, this room appears to be nothing more than a warm and comfortable study.  Materials are strewn about in various piles, and a small unmade bed lies in a corner next to a wooden footlocker.  A tiny potted fern sits next to a wall relief of a shackled demoness with deep red eyes that seem to follow your every move."
