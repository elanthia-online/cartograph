    "The walls and ceiling of the darkened chamber form a solid dome of black granite that seems to absorb all light except for the tiny glimmers of thousands of tiny white gemstones embedded in its surface, swirling in a spreading spiral like an endless expanse of distant stars.  The only source of the sparks of light reflected from above is a faint flicker from a silvery crystal ball which stands on a dark stone pedestal in the center of the chamber.  Dark-cushioned couches line the silent, curving walls."
