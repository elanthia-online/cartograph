    "The area is composed of a stone platform, extending out from the main tower.  A stone workbench is situated in the center of the area and is accompanied by a rusting metal pedestal.  Moonlight casts dark shadows across the floor from the workbench and the pedestal.  Several large wooden cages sit neatly stacked to one side of the area."
