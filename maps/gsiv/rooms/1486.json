    "Cargo ships and barges dock at Baron's Quay just to the west, the quay forming a breakwater that protects the canal and its shipping.  To the north beyond Bayside Road and Charl's Quay, the timbers of the Market Bridge stretch across the waters of the bay from North 'Haven to Marshtown.  South along the waterfront the South Market Pier is visible reaching out into the ocean, while beyond it the naked timbers of the shipyard and the stilted warehouses of the Bonding Pier can be made out.",
