    "Smooth ivory walls deftly painted with metallic-thorned brambles create a vibrant, summery atmosphere inside the spacious wagon.  Several jade vases filled with casually arranged wildflowers are dotted about the room, their earthy scent filling the air with a mild sweetness.  A saber-legged rich maoral wardrobe is notably centered upon the narrow-planked heart of pine flooring."
