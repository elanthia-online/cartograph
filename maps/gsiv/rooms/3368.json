    "The familiar construction of a seaside town spreads throughout the neighborhood, complete with garish colors and several buildings sitting on stilts to raise them out of the snow.  Keepsakes and trophies from seafaring ventures past hang in windows up and down Galleon Road, proudly displayed by their owners for all to see."
