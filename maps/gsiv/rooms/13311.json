    "Fresh rushes have been strewn across the stone floor, laced with herbs that help to mask the smell of too many bodies pressed into such a small space.  A fireplace in the side wall houses a small but cheery blaze, and polished wooden benches are scattered around the room.  Along the rear wall of the tavern, an ornately carved maoral bar holds various barkeeping implements and an engraved silver sign.",
