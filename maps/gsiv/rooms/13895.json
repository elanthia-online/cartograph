    "The tunnel constricts, becoming little more than an alleyway.  Its length is hung with brightly patterned banners, swaying one after another in a festive parade of color.  Fantastic beasts decorate some, rendered in the strict conventions of posture and vantage point.  Doors sit beneath each device, the sills painted in matching tones."
