    "Pale moonlight highlights the abundance of muted grey veins of quartz that snake through the sloping gabbro path.  Emerging from jagged cracks in the uneven ground, plumes of acrid steam obscure much of the surrounding area, creating only a single path for reasonably safe passage.  The rhythmic sound of waves crashing on rocks below is broken only by the occassional shriek from somewhere in the encompassing darkness.",

The cries of sea birds overhead and the crashing of waves upon the rocks below add an eerie musical score to the steam-enveloped slope."
