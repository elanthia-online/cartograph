  "description": [
    "The small hill gives way to a sudden cutoff as it approaches the swiftly flowing stream below.  Verdant shrubs and brush grow from the cliff face below, nestled into the gnarled roots of the large, towering trees along the hill's edge.  Brightly colored pink ginger blossoms bloom from a number of niches in the tree roots.  A three-masted ship is beached next to the hill and the jungle has begun to claim the boat for itself.  The captain's balcony at the back of the boat is quite close to the cliff face."
