    "A small pile of linens from the wine room to the south has been piled against the wall here, presumably awaiting retrieval by a preoccupied servant.  Mounted above them is a brass sculpture of a snake that is wrought in such a manner as to appear to have emerged from the wall.  The snake's coils form a solid cylinder in which a bouquet of fresh wildflowers has been placed."
