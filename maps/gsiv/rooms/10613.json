  "description": [
    "The constant wind howls through dead trees and the remains of broken-down shacks.  Scratching and chittering can be heard coming from beneath a pile of abandoned logs.  A small handaxe is imbedded in one of the logs as if the woodcutter had been suddenly called away from his work."
