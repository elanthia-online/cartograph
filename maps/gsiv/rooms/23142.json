  "description": [
    "A calf-high sanded piece of wood, running the length of one wall, serves as a cozy bench to sit, or discard articles of clothing, on.  A tall gilded mirror, securely attached to the wall opposite the bench, adds a touch of grandeur.  Sets of five silver hooks, in horizontal lines, are strategically placed at several heights and allow customers of all sizes a comfortable perch to hang their potential purchases."
