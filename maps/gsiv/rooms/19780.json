  "description": [
    "An imposing mistwood writing desk paired with a tall, straight-backed chair is arranged in front of a large window, a rolling cart laid out with a silver tea set parked nearby.  Thick with dust, the shelves inside a large cabinet are stocked with bins of parchment, stacks of note cards, and assorted ornate glass bottles.  A fluffy white cat peeks out from a white wicker bin filled with discarded stationery."
