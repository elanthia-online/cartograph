    "A diamond-nooked cellarette spans the entire back wall of this small room, and the shoulders and necks of wine bottles peek out from its depths.  A sparse few of the nooks are bereft of bottles, but are filled all the same by webbed tunnels woven by spiders or random bits of miscellany.  Underfoot, the uneven stone floor is solid, and every sound, no matter how slight, rebounds endlessly."
