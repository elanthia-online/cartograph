  "description": [
    "Light filtering through the red canvas of the roof and red-lensed nomad lanterns wash everything with a lurid glow.  The polished fel bar, resting on stacked casks, runs along the east wall, and bottles of every shape and color line the two shelves behind it.  Pedestal tables of various heights and ledges along the wagon sides provide rests for tankards and mugs, but with such cramped quarters there's no sign of anything to sit on."
