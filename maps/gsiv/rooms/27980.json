    "Forming a wall to the southeast, rows of trees protect the pathways of Summit Academy from the brisk breeze that filters in off the surrounding mountains.  Dark brown mud creates a thin track that leads away from the traditional grounds and marches in a northeasterly direction towards a city of brightly colored tents and painted wooden structures.  A wall of thuja hugs the northwestern edge of the muddy pathway, the tall trees sculpted to resemble horses rearing up."
