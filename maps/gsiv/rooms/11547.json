  "description": [
    "A trail leads north along the bluff.  Maelstrom Bay stretches off to the west.  Along the base of the bluff to the west is a narrow strip of shingle beach, against which the surf pounds noisily.  To the south the ground falls away abruptly as if some cataclysmic tectonic shift took place, creating a steep escarpment in the stone-riddled, peaty soil.  The thick reeds of a salt marsh grow abundantly at the bottom of the escarpment."
