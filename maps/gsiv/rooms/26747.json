    "Several funnel-shaped lanterns hang in the center of the small rock wall-enclosed chamber, but despite their steady glow, their light fails to crawl into the far corners of the chilly area.  Just under the lanterns, a small two-tiered fountain burbles quietly.  Two ash grey velvet couches sit next to each other in front of it, with a thick swirling red cloud floating between them.  The limestone walls are glossed over by dark, oily streaks in areas, which are especially prevelant around an oddly twisted door handle that sticks out of the rock.",
