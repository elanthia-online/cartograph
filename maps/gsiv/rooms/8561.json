  "description": [
    "As you crest the grassy hill here, you see that the footprint-laden path winds down the slope towards a rickety dome-shaped wooden structure.  For some reason, on this side of the hill the wildflowers and vegetation seem even more abundant.  Virtually all of the area surrounding the structure is filled with vibrant, colorful flowers and very little of the tall meadow grass."
