    "The small tent is isolated by luxurious lengths of amaranthine and plum-hued bourde washed with a very slight, silver luster.  Covered glass domes that house tiny, flickering gold lights illuminate the surroundings and spill their radiance across the surface of a darkly lacquered wooden counter.  A line of caged metal dress forms are bolstered by a thin-paneled platform and fitted in sumptuous, glimmering fabrics."
