  "description": [
    "The murk of the swamp begins to fade into a pasture of dead grass as the land rises into a hill.  Sitting alone in the middle of the meadowland is a scorched oak, its dead limbs reaching into the sky.  Crumbled blocks are scattered along the ground, some pinned into the soil by the gnarled roots which worm along the surface."
