    "The expansive courtyards with their manicured lawns and well-delineated walkways present a testament to the discipline and perseverance of its members which can be better appreciated from aloft.  The view from this vantage point extends from the traning arena and swimming pool areas to many of the beautiful vars and landmarks of the shining city."
