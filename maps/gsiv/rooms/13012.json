    "Behind the entrance gate is a moonlit courtyard paved with polished cobblestones in varying hues of white, grey, and blue.  The building beyond the courtyard is an imposing grey marble structure.  Creeping vines bearing stark white roses find root in flowerbeds at the manor's base and overrun the lower walls.  A break in the floral cacophony of the walls allows for an arched black willow door.   Shaded by a large weeping willow is a varnished ebonwood bench and a gurgling white marble fountain.",
