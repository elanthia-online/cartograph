  "description": [
    "The vaulted dark mahogany ceiling of this room rises above black marble walls and a thick black carpet, framing a large fireplace by the north wall and bookshelves upon the south.  Several comfortable leather armchairs rest before the fire, facing a portrait hung above the mantel, while a large four-poster bed rests nearby.  The glaes windows are shielded by long velvet curtains, providing privacy for the occupants."
