  "description": [
    "The table is shielded from view by a masterfully carved teak screen, creating a private alcove that still offers glimpses of the rest of the pub.  The teak table, as beautifully carved as the sheltering screen, is accompanied by matching high-backed chairs with grey leather seats.  A palm sitting close by adds to the nook's seclusion."
