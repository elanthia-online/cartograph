    "The condensation has turned to frost here, giving the walls a pale sheen like the pallor of death.  Ice crunches under your feet no matter how hard you try to move silently.  From time to time, ice cold drops of water fall from the ceiling and manage, with great skill, to find their way down the back of your neck.  You choke back a muttered curse at the biting cold."
