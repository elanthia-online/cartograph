  "description": [
    "A dozen military-style cots fill the dormitory, each outfitted with a single, firm pillow and a coarse wool blanket.  A wide, flat footlocker lies at the end of each cot, leaving just enough space to walk comfortably between them.  The quiet snores of the few off-duty guardsmen drift through the room."
