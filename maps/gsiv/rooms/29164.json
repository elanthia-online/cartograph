    "Descending to a pair of wooden steps, the southernmost section of the pier terminates in a lower finger pier that houses five docking slips.  Sturdy oak railings line the descent, while bright blue letters form a greeting to \"Pier Five\" on nearby pilings.  Diamonds of darker blue painted with numbers in their center are arranged in ascending order and range from 21 to 25."
