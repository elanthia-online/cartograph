    "Tiny pieces of quartz are visible through the thick clay of the surrounding walls, their jagged forms glinting with the little reflected light that reaches the area.  Dark brown stains splotch the floor haphazardly, the tiny speckles nearly invisible against the monotonous earthen color so prevalent throughout the area.  A single discarded torch lies upon the floor, the flame long since snuffed out."
