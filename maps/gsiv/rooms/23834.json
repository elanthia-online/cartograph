  "description": [
    "In the center of the courtyard a white tower rises skyward, light flickering in the windows.  Mossy pathways meander among the quiet oak trees leading from door to door in the circular structure that encloses the area.  A small pond, its surface dotted with floating candles, is nestled near some flower patches.  Living sapling benches, formed by intertwining branches near a stone shrine, offer places to sit and enjoy the night air.  Somewhere nearby an owl hoots his nighttime refrain."
