    "Water droplets condensing on the hollow-tiled ceiling above the central bath grow gravid in the steamy air and return to their source with a quiet splash.  Silver ewers and vials of scented oil are within easy reach of the communal bath, their tarnished surfaces reflecting the flickering candlelight dimly.  A large window on the western wall appears to serve the dual purpose of allowing bathers to admire the night skies and to put themselves on display."
