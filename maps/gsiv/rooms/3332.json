    "A dark alley splits the buildings to the east, glittering feline eyes blinking out into the light, then disappearing into the blackness.  A breath of wind races across the rooftops, sending weathervanes spinning, loudly squeaking, announcing their lack of oil for all to hear.  The snow brave enough to crowd the vanes flies in every direction, looking like a vessel of white sugar had just broken open."
