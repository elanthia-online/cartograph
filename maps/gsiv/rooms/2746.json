    "A small refuge has been carved into the snow and domed with ice blocks, giving shelter from the merciless winds.  Light filtering through the crystalline walls bathes the enclosure in a soft glow.  A wooden hatch leads out to the freezing hinterland to the south and an opening offers passage north."
