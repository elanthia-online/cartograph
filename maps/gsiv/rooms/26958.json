  "description": [
    "Blankets of verdant moss surround the smooth limestones of the pathway, their rounded edges appearing like floating islands in a sea of green that stretch away from the glass-like travertine walls of the Needle of Pentas before disappearing into the garden.  Moonlight and shadows place across the sea glass panels of the awning above, its protective shelter affixed to the walls with brass and modwir supports.  A pair of large terracotta planters housing several spiky bougainvillea vines rest by the entry."
