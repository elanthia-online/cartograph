    "In the wind-driven swaying of lantern light, a battalion of ghost crabs can be glimpsed nearby, overtaking the black sand beaches and staking claim to the pilings beneath the pier.  The planked decking underfoot creaks rhythmically in time with the incoming waves sent forth by the midnight black seas surrounding the harbor.",
    "Squawking birds of all sizes wheel overhead, making strafing runs atop the water and plunging dives beneath it to secure a meal.  Successful hunters perch upon the handrails to devour their prize, mobbed by would-be meal thieves.  The planked decking underfoot creaks rhythmically in time with the incoming waves sent forth by the roiling, blue-green seas surrounding the harbor."
