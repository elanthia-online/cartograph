  "description": [
    "Potted plants are set upon the ledges above, their flowers blending in with the multi-colored window frames that watch over them.  Cracks slither along the walls of the many buildings that enclose the area tightly, though the air seems clearer and less heavy here.  Moonlight drifts through from above, banishing nearly all patches of shadow, though the faint sounds of scurrying and occasional footsteps in the darkness beyond betray any sense of comfort.",
