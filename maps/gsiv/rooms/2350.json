    "Narrow stairs descend from the glacial ice deep into the bedrock below.  A stencil-cut metal lantern hanging from the ceiling of this chamber turns slowly, sending figures of light into a macabre dance with the shadows.  Murals fill the east and west walls, their images rendered in stark colors and bold, discordant compositions.  The room's sparse aestheticism is broken only by the two altars standing opposite each other, dark gold to the east and grey granite to the west."
