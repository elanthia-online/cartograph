    "Heavy, watered silk curtains of rich crimson trimmed with gold frame the tall windows here.  A large desk occupies the center of this small, circular room, its well-polished ebony surface fairly gleaming in the light from delicately wrought invar wall sconces.  Shelves line the walls, filled with an odd assortment of dusty tomes, miniature portraits, and arcane devices."
