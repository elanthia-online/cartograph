    "[Highguard Keep, Great Hall]"

  "description": [
    "Large enough to swallow a modest inn whole, the great hall is clearly the heart of the castle.  Braziers and a massive fieldstone hearth provide just enough light to reveal exposed ironwood beams high above the bearskin rugs and leather chairs scattered throughout the chamber.  Tapestries depicting scenes of battles and hunts add color to stone walls.  Pine boughs arranged on a T-shaped table that could seat a small army combine their fragrance with the pungent aromas of ale and roasted meats.  A grey granite throne inlaid with ironwood rises amidst a menagerie of trophy heads."
