    "Soft garnet-hued curtains frame the cottage's glaesine-paned windows, casting the room's interior in a rosy moonlit glow.  Woven multicolored rugs are scattered about the polished hardwood floor.  A dark maoral counter rests near the back of the room, lined with small drawers fitted with tiny locks.",
