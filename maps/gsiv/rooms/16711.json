  "description": [
    "The makeshift wall of broken limbs and trees that surrounds the warcamp cuts in and around a large supply hut set farther away from the main encampment.  Several barrels rest outside the hut's entrance and a large crate lies broken nearby, its contents spilling out onto the ground.  A shallow, filthy ditch running alongside the path leading up to the hunt smells like a pitiful attempt at a latrine and serves as the breeding ground for yellow-stained, writhing maggots."
