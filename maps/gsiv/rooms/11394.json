  "description": [
    "Wind whistles through a gap in the battlement in a space created by the absence of a stone block.  The wail climbs and lowers in an intensity as the strength of the breeze rises and diminishes, offering a haunting song rich with the aroma of the burning violets carried upon the wind.  Below, the ravine beckons along the base of the Citadel, dark and forboding."
