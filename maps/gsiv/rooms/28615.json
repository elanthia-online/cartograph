  "description": [
    "Shrouds of violet-tinged ebon velvet hang from the ceiling, blocking out the feeble luminescence filtering through indigo stained glass windows along the western wall.  A chill permeates the air, though no breeze stirs the dense draperies.  Grey gauze cloaks an austere ash altar like curtains of moonlight.  Blazing from a caged sconce of dark silver mournbloom vines, a violet flame casts feeble radiance over a dark tapestry spread across the wall behind the altar."
