    "This room is notably bare of furniture.  A bed, built high off the ground, has been pushed up against the south wall, opposite the old wooden bookcase to the north.  Various tomes of all shapes and colors fill the shelves, the spines decorated by golden inked runes.  Beneath the window in the east wall is a large table covered in papers and unrolled scrolls."
