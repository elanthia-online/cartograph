    "The burrow is surprisingly spacious, although its low ceiling suggests its inhabitants are of a diminutive stature.  Along the perimeter of the roof, small round windows admit diffuse beams of moonlight as well as fresh air from the garden outside.  Over in one corner, sheltered by a wooden screen, sits a carved monir tub and opposite it, a snug little bed completes the lair's cozy comforts.",
