  "description": [
    "The constant roar of steam passing through the chamber all but deafens you.  Looking out toward the center of the great room it is impossible to see clearly across for all the columns of steam.  Still, in the raging mist you can make out the dim shapes of the far rim.  A trick of refracted light makes it look as though one of them is stumbling toward you.  It must be a bit of heat stroke."
