  "description": [
    "The broad splay of white oak plank flooring unfolds to meet the high stone walls.  Numerous rows of lacquered rowan benches are separated by a wide aisle that stretches from the front door to a stately oak lectern set at the head of the room.  Behind the lectern stands a pair of oak double doors framed by two tall recessed windows.  Candles held in golden sconces line the eastern and western walls, and a large chandelier hangs high over the aisle, tethered to the center beam of the lofty, exposed timber ceiling."
