    "The forest opens up into a large clearing with jagged stumps cluttering the landscape in every which way.  In the midst of the field of remnants, two large oak trees rise up above thirty feet tall, their huge branches extending out to properly display their dominance.  Each branch of the trees hold a razor-sharp edge reminiscent of claws stained with murky ichor."
