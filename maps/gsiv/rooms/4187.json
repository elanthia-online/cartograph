    "The walls still have that melted look except where some excavation has been done to widen the area or search for something.  You see a few thin lines of gold in the rock.  As you reach out to touch the gold, you can feel the warmth like a great oven assault your fingertips.  It is not hot enough to instantly burn you, but hot enough to make you recoil in surprise."
