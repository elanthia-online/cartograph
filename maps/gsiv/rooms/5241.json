    "Here on deck, the weathered ship looks almost seaworthy, belying the massive holes in the hull.  The wooden timbers of the deck are bleached almost white from years of the relentless beating of the sun.  Still solid but worn smooth by years of weathering, the deck continues northeast to the bow.  A ladder leads down into the hold.",
    "Here on deck, the weathered ship looks almost seaworthy, belying the massive holes in the hull.  The wooden timbers of the deck are bleached almost white from years of the relentless beating of the sun, and stand in stark contrast to the black scars of a recent fire about many of the holes in the deck.  Still solid but worn smooth by years of weathering, the deck continues northeast to the bow.  A blackened ladder leads down into the hold."
