    "Plain cotton cushions cover the sanded maoral planks in lieu of chairs.  Wind chimes of wood and beaten brass turn in the breeze and add their gentle harmony to the atonal, yet tranquil music of nature.  To your south, the pavilion rises above the treetops, its banners brilliant against the cloudless sky."
