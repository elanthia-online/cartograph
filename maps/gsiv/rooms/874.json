    "The path continues to climb, travel growing more difficult as large boulders and broken shale clog the pass.  The most stable footing can be found against the southern wall of the canyon, where a sharp incline rises above the debris on the canyon floor.  The trail ascends the rocky shelf, climbing out of the canyon and onto the mountainside."
