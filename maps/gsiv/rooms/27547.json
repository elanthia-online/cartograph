  "description": [
    "A polished wooden desk with clawed feet, a high-backed wooden chair sitting behind it, takes up most of the space in this small section of the tent.  A low brown leather couch sits opposite an embroidered tapestry that takes up an entire wall.  The smell of fresh blood permeates the still, humid air."
