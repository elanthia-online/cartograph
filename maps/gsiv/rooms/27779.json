    "This small tent is cramped and smells faintly of hard working troll.  Several creatures mill about or sit on crates, apparently waiting for something.  A large troll stands off to one side, occasionally scratching himself.  Coiled in an open cage, a cobra flicks its tongue desultorily, looking from side to side.  A cracked and peeling sign is propped up against the back of the tent partially hiding the recumbent form of a loudly snoring black bear."
