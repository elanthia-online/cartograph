    "Shredded bits and pieces of clothing from previous adventurers traipsing around down here are stuck to the rough edges of the walls in this circular in shape chamber.  The cramped quarters make walking two abreast almost impossible.  Packed to the rim with an odd assortment of items, rocks and other debris are dozens of compartments in the stone walls."
