    "The tunnel narrows as the floor begins to exhibit deep fissures.  Across the walls, the cracks reach up from the floor and spread their splayed fingers in long, running fractures.  Deep piles of dust occupy corners produced by the ruptures, and a fine cloud of the stuff hangs in the air as if suspended in time."
