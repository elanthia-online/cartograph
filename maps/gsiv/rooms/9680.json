    "Etched brass flowerpots stand opposite each other overflowing with purple and yellow pansies.  Littering the ground beneath one of the pots are a few of the curled and discolored velvety petals.  The sides of the polished white marble floor are visible beneath the plush, powder blue runner that runs the length of the corridor."
