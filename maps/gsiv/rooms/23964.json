    "Nature has done much to reclaim the old river port set beside the Tempest, with vines clinging possessively to masonry and weeds obscuring foundations.  The visible port has the resemblance of a small village built around a narrow rectangular square.  Several obvious warehouses line the area closest to the river, while miscellaneous and harder to discern structures surround the other sides of the square."
