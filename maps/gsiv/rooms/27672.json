    "A masterfully painted floor-to-ceiling mural on the southern wall of this corridor is lit by a quintet of sphere-encased white motes of light maintained by some unseen source of power.  Pedestrians make their way around numerous white and gold edelweiss potted in a tall clay vessel, some stopping to enjoy their aroma.  The scuffed floor beneath your feet suggests increased traffic to and from the administrative offices of government."
