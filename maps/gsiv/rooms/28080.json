    "Built into the lee of the stables, the small shop has canvas walls of off-white upon the eastern edge and freshly cut sycamore walls on the west.  Wrought iron supports suspend a sailcloth ceiling, the blackened poles also holding lanterns aloft, while the rough ground has been trampled smooth and flat.  A welcoming sign sits near the entry next to a long display table."
