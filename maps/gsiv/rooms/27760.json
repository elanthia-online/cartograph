    "This bend in the path harbors hand-carved grey stone benches draped with shimmering ice.  Long, tapered icicles have formed at the bottom of each one in a near-perfect fringed pattern.  Evergreen firs dusted with sparkling mounds of fresh, powdery snow provide a shadowy shelter over the benches, while a pair of torches grants a bit of ambient light to the spot."
