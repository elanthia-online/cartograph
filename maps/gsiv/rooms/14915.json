    "A small clearing gives way to a narrow southeasterly trail that traces along a rushing creek.  Rounded stones in a myriad of hues line the bed of the waterway, some built up in spots to create small burbling fountains.  Moonlight drifting down through the leafy canopy overhead playfully sparkles on the glistening protrusions.",
