  "description": [
    "The distinctive, musty smell common to very old buildings is strong here.  Long rows of shelves fill half the area and the other side has overturned tables, probably once a work area.  Rustling noises in the shadows betray the presence of mice or rats.  Suddenly, a choking cloud of dust erupts as a huge, white owl bursts into flight from the low rafters!  It disappears down the hall to the north, within the blink of an eye."
