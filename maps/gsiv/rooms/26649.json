    "A twisted, winding path is just discernible between the jagged rocks stabbing at the sky.  Silvery-hued mists settle between the rocks battling the constant crash of waves to claim domain here, leaving you coated in a salty mist.   A long-abandoned lighthouse stands at the point where shore meets sea, silhouetted in the darkness against the silvery white, moonlit horizon.",
    "A twisted, winding path is just discernible between the jagged rocks stabbing at the sky.  The click-clack of crabs and the scuttle of small, jointed feet are barely heard over the constant crash of the waves against the spires.  A long-abandoned lighthouse stands at the point where shore meets sea, silhouetted against waves on the horizon."
