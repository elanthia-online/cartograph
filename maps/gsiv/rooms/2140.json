    "An old lava channel forms a ready path through the basalt outcroppings and boulders that the volcano has thrown this far.  To the north, a hillock rises out of the litter of stones, its shoulders strewn with rubble and its top a flat expanse.  A trail zigzags up the incline, punctuated with pockets of lava that decorate the hillock with their flickering red light."
