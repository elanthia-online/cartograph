    "This small island is actually nothing more than a large piece of rock that sticks up out of the water in the very center of the lake.  Two structures can be seen on the island.  A small hut sits near the waterline, while a tiny pavillion sits on higher ground in the center of the island.  A thin trail seems to lead up that way."
