    "A long ironwood workbench under the windows hosts a variety of unusual implements.  Off to the side of the workbench is a supply cabinet.  On the opposite side of the room, a pale glowbark inlay has been set into a clear section of the polished fel floor.  At the center of the inlay is a heavy wooden pedestal.  The faint smell of ozone pervades the air."
