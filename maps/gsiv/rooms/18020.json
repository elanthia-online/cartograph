    "The makeshift valley is filled with elaborate and unusual shapes and creations of snow, continuing up the side of the slope to the northeast.  Several small children push a great ball of snow around, gathering it in preparation for the creation of another snow-creature.  A small plaque dedicates the area to the young and the young at heart."
