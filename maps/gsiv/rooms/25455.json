    "The wagon's heart opens to a hourglass-shaped room, with the high-reaching walls cloaked in jade and onyx brocaded silk.  Fluently leading customers to a spade-footed black willow display and a mirrored dark walnut bureau, a curved pathway continues towards some glass-topped cases placed under numerous shadowy landscape-painted canvases.  A flatwoven cloth-of-copper rug worked with tea roses separates the commodities from a pair of bronze-handled doors."
