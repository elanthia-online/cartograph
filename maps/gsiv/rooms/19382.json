    "Warm beneath the heat of the sun, the glittering sands of the peninsula are surrounded on three sides by water.  On the southern side, the surf pounds against a beach dotted with umbrellas and blankets, while to the north dozens of tide pools are filled with all manner of tiny aquatic life.  A striped awning attached to a small wooden cart provides shade for a small child.  High above, cormorants dance through the crystal blue sky, their cries soft and melodic.",
    "Silvery mist plays across the glittering sands of the peninsula, and a cool breeze, created by the surf pounding against the beach, chills the air.  On the southern side, dark shadows outline the beach where umbrellas and blankets are arranged for use, while to the north dozens of tide pools filled with salty water lay quiescent beneath the moonlight.  A small child stands beside a small wooden cart with a striped awning."
