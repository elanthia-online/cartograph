    "The limbs of the trees intertwine overhead, creating a thick canopy through which rays of sunlight filter.  The sweet, heady aromas of apple, cherry, peach, and bergamot flood the area.  A heavy iron fence closely borders the cobblestone path along its entire length as it snakes its way through the orchard, prohibiting any access to the trees or their fruit."
