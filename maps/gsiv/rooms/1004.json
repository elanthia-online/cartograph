    "The stone avenues give way to a mixture of humus and dirt.  Narrow, well-trod lanes wind among gigantic toadstools and spreading mushrooms.  Boulders and decaying logs, seemingly placed at random among the dense growth, provide places for lichens, mosses and fungal growth to grow abundantly.  A moist coolness pervades the area, and the reflected light from the crystalline dome is filtered and muted by the many varieties of non-luminescent toadstools that tower overhead."
