    "Above the colossal hall, rows of argent banners blazoned by azure sunbursts hang from immense wooden trusses.  Tall stained glass windows set into stone arches stretch skyward, their mottled light illuminating the granite tiled floor, each flanked by wall-mounted arms of all types.  A vast round table surrounded by heavy wooden chairs dominates the center of the hall, and at its end an immense stone hearth regally occupies a dais below a grand azurite stone sun supported by numerous heraldic shields."
