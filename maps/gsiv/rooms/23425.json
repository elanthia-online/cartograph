    "The temperature of the water feels as chill as a snowstorm, the slight current laden with no hints of warmth.  Much further below, the ocean floor is overwhelmed with coral rock formations that jut up from the surface, and while there are splashes of color dotted along it, the sand that is constantly stirred up from the floor partially obscures the view.  To one side, the beginnings of a wavering kelp forest wave back-and-forth, while all other directions give a majestic view of the dark blue sea."
