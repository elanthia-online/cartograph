    "The circular chamber is built of dark granite with the exception of white marble used to outline the ribbing of a vaulted ceiling.  The room is mainly bare with only a few stacked crates flanked on one side by a large dust bin and on the other by a wooden footlocker.  An archway, outlined with the same marble as the ceiling, leads off into another room."
