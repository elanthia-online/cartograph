  "description": [
    "Polished fel walls house windows that stretch along the entire expanse of the eastern wall and reach from polished floor to raftered ceiling.  Glaesine panes swing into the room along the top portion of each window to admit a river-borne breeze that cools the stuffy air of the room, as well as relieves it of a portion of the stench created by the curing leather.  Cobbler's benches rest beneath the windows, while wide book cases lined with wares frame the double-wide archway leading into the front room."
