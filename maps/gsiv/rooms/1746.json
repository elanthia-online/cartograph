    "A small patch of forget-me-nots bravely blooms in the shelter of a large nearby boulder.  The boulder cuts off the wind and snow on one side while reflecting the daytime sun down to the flowers on the other side.  A bit of a breeze manages to swirl around the boulder to gently rock the flowers back and forth.  Underneath, in small moss beds, insects busily rustle through the debris from the flowers, perhaps searching for food or nesting material.",
