  "description": [
    "Rows of ebonwood tables set haphazardly with steins and mugs span the length of the hall.  Seated on adjacent long ebonwood benches are resting medics and recovering patients.  On one side are small-paned glaesine windows, and on the other a wide stone hearth capped with a solid mantle of walnut commands the focus of the hall.  Over the hearth is a silver-framed oil painting, and from exposed ceiling beams hang many unused drinking vessels.  A mithril-banded ebonwood door opens to a spiraling stairwell that leads further up into the tower.  A small basket of wooden sticks sits in the shadows against a polished ebonwood bar inlaid with ivory."
