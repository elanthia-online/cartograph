  "description": [
    "The path widens and the pattern formed of variegated river stones grows more complex and beautiful.  Flowers appear on either side, camping at the foot of the tall willows in thick clumps where the tall, arching white and purple flowers of hostas compete with multicolored feathery plumes of astilbe and dark brown stems of cinnamon ferns.  Ahead, the vertical pattern of a palisade is visible through a dense fringe of hanging willow boughs."
