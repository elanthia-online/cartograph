    "The melodic hum of honeybees drifts through the warm air as each tiny drone flits from blossom to blossom, collecting pollen for the hive.  A few small, golden butterflies accompany the bees, their delicate movements amongst the broad, colorful petals and slender, verdant stalks silent amid the lazy buzz of their counterparts.",
    "The distant lapping sound of the river drifts through the cool night air as a collection of glowing fireflies hovers over a series of flower gardens.  The high-pitched music of crickets, as well as the low croaking voices of a hidden chorus of bullfrogs, accompanies the slow dance of the tiny glimmering insects."
