    "A gold enameled trunk sits in the corner of the dye room opposite a number of boxes set along the ground.  Each wall in the room is painted with a different primary color, from a fiery red to a deep midnight blue.  The pristine white runner leading to the counter is in stark contrast to the other colors in the room."
