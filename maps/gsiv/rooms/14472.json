    "Water falling over rocks echoes from the enclosures to the northwest, occasionally drowned out by a feline scream.  Several brown pinecones have fallen from their parent trees and bounced down the rocky hillside, coming to rest along the borders of the white graveled path.  A glimpse of a tall tower with a staircase spiraling around it can be seen to the northeast.",

A tall tower outlined by the light of the moons rises into the sky to the northeast."
