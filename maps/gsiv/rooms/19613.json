    "Daylight pours through the faceted panes of the stained glass dome ceiling of the bridal shop, cascading the room in a plethora of warm, colorful light.  Finely etched silver and gold accents are throughout the shop, including an exquisite armoire and table upon which fine silken wares are displayed.  A gentle melody floats throughout the room, its origin indiscernible, creating a serene atmosphere.",
