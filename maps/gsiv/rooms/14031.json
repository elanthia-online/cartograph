    "A clustered grove of young aspen trees shelters a small marble shrine.  Garlands of flowers in varying hues of red are draped from the trees, and red petals are sprinkled about the soft carpet of grass underfoot.  Fireflies dance through the leaves of the trees, causing tiny patches of illumination to come and go like the twinkling of the overhead stars.",
    "A clustered grove of young aspen trees shelters a small marble shrine.  Garlands of flowers, all in varying hues of red, are draped from the trees and extend to the soft carpet of grass underfoot.  Butterflies dance merrily about the blossoms and birds sing from the topmost branches, luxuriating in the warm sunlight that bathes the area."
