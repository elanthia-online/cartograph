  "description": [
    "Great vaulted ceilings arch high above, supported by thick ribs of gold-flecked blue riverstone.  Although fuscous patches of mold spread over parts of the walls, the original color of the chamber is still visible.  The pallid blue hue of the plaster walls contrasts pleasantly with the deeper blue of the riverstone.  Bas relief carvings of fantastic sea creatures encircle the room."
