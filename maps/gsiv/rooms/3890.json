    "The rock-lined path leads behind several of the shacks and ends at a structure that looks incongruous for this area.  The small shop is constructed of the finest modwir, which someone has apparently decided to paint a sky blue.  The workmanship of the construction is exquisite, perhaps even elven handywork.  A large sign hangs above the door."
