    "The crystalline walls are melted into frozen rivulets in this chamber, and held within them are roaring flames that slither along the walls like sinuous serpents of an endless inferno.  Engulfing the entire chamber and held at bay by a small measure of translucent crystal, the heat from the fire washes across the chamber in hazy waves, blurring and contorting the air about the room.  A set of steps descends down through the center of the room's floor."
