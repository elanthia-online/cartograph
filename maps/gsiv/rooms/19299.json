    "Simple furnishings in the cozy room reveal the spare taste of its inhabitant, just as the low ceiling suggests the individual's height.  A small sofa's sole decoration is an embroidered willow tree on its back, and opposite that, a cleanly designed desk is piled high with papers and manuscripts.  Two stuffed chairs face an iron stove with an odd chamber above the firebox.  A hinged door on its front shows that it is an oven, perfectly sized for baking any manner of delights including tarts."
