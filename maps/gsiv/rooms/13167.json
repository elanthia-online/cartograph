    "A small trail emerges from the brush at the foot of a wooden bridge that spans a creek.  Hidden in places by shadowy growths of ferns, the creek reflects the moonlight with rippling sparkles, and fireflies hovering in the foliage around the bridge add the magic of their flickering light.",
    "A small trail emerges from the brush at the foot of a wooden bridge that spans a creek.  Hidden in places by dense growths of ferns, the creek is clear and its current looks strong.  Growths of moss and other water plants add splotches of green to the mottled tones of the stone bed beneath the babbling water."
