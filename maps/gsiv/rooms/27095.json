    "Sunlight filters in through the branches of nearby trees on the shoreline, broken into brilliant shafts that illuminate the vivid blue surface of the lagoon.  A few stray flowers float in the water, drifting around aimlessly as the current shifts them to and fro, and the occasional silvery fish nibbles at the underside."
