    "The breathtaking view from the edge of the precipice is nothing short of spectacular.  Spread across the valley to the southeast, cultivated farmlands form a gently contrasting checkerboard of green, while the thickly forested areas of Wraithenmist and Gyldemar are visible to the north and east.  Just beyond the northern edge of Wraithenmist, the Lake of Shadowed Sorrows glimmers on the horizon.",
    "The breathtaking view from the edge of the precipice is nothing short of spectacular.  Spread across the valley to the southeast, the twinkling lights of crafters' huts and the township of Sylvarraend dot the dark landscape, echoing the glimmer of constellations in the night sky.  Just beyond the northern edge of the Wraithenmist, mist rolls off the Lake of Shadowed Sorrows, drifting up through the dark sky in ethereal wisps."
