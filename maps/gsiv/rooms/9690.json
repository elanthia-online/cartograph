    "Within the sheltering walls of this courtyard, a small fountain gurgles quietly into a fish pond.  Stepping stones trace a path through the beds of roses and banks of lavender, while curved stone benches allow for restful contemplation.  Birds sing in the branches of the apple trees that provide respites of shade along the walkway.",
