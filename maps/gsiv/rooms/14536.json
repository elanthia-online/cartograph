    "Tiny, razor-edged plant fronds drape over the edge of the cliff, posing a hazard to taller visitors.  The view from this elevation allows glimpses of jewel-bright birds flitting through the lower branches of the canopy.  Raucous bird calls ricochet along the rock wall, merging with the sound of rushing water."
