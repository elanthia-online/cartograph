    "[Apple Orchard]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Spindly young apple trees, many nipped off at the top by browsing animals, have sprouted along the border between field and orchard.  Less hardy and slower growing than the bramble bushes that compete with them for space, the tender saplings are unlikely to reach maturity.  Even so, the parent trees to the east continue to cast seed-laden apples into the field every season with the falling of the leaves."
