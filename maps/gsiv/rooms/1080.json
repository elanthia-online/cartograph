    "A shriek pierces through the wind's howling, the source somewhere toward the interior of the plateau.  Moaning follows, rising in pitch, then subsiding again.  Then, as the wind suddenly picks up speed, another shriek, exactly the same as before, followed again by the low moaning as the wind slows its gusting.  Eventually the pattern becomes distinguishable, another effect of the wind's lonely journey through this desolate plateau."
