  "description": [
    "Books line the walls of the cozy room, where comfortable armchairs are gathered on a stone flagged floor.  Specimens of rock, samples of wood and a variety of plants pressed in glaes decorate the bookshelves.  The amazing collection of artifacts and items are carefully arranged by subject and type, obviously the work of a lifetime.  A red thrak rug offers a comfortable resting spot to enjoy the warm fire and read in the flames' soft glow."
