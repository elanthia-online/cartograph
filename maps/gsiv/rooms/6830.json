    "The path continues around the exterior of the drear, ramshackle shell of the old inn.  As you gaze at it, it is hard to imagine it once provided a welcome haven for weary travellers in the wilderness.  Now, as the hills of the Upper Trollfang press in around you, it inspires only a sense of fear and foreboding."
