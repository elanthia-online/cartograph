    "Following the curve the island, the waterway flows gently against the sandy beaches to the west and north.  Meeting a barrier of rocks that rise from the ocean floor, the waves bounce back upon themselves and create a choppy cross-current that disturbs the seaweed beds below.  Several long, slippery strands of kelp, that have been dislodged by the tide, bob up and down on the water's surface."
