    "A row of beds covered with green woolen blankets lines the far wall.  Narrow cots are mounted above the beds with wooden supports.  In front of each bed is a low metal locker latched with a bulbous, iron lock.  Small tables are spaced between each sleeping area, all set with an assortment of neatly organized personal effects."
