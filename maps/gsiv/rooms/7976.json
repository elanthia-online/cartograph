  "description": [
    "The mayor's office is spartan, with straightbacked chairs, over one of which is draped a striped voalcat vest, and a stolid desk.  A cabinet contains a menacing assortment of iron and steel weapons, a few hunting trophies, and parchment maps of the Landing and outlying districts.",
    "At the varnished modwir door, a red bear skin rug stretches across the polished hardwood floors while twin velnalin hide chairs face the Mayor's pine desk.  A great stag's head is mounted above a cobblestone fireplace set into the western wall.  Several tumblers of liquor and shot glasses rest atop an oak bar beside a tall arched window.  A blue-streaked river trout is mounted above an open closet, its mouth still wedged open by a fish hook.",
    "From a dais, the maoral desk and an ivory and velvet curule seat loom over two carved wooden chairs.  Tapestry rugs cover the hardwood floor, their patterns complementing the arched windows flanking the desk.  A stag's head stares at a panoramic fresco mounted opposite it.  In a corner near the bar, a scarred witchwood perch rises to the high ceiling, while several feet away, a black iron stove rests against the west wall and is topped with a silver kettle."
