    "Streaks of tufa stone striate the granite walls, evidence of previous tectonic disturbance.  Small pebbles crunch underfoot and create tiny dam-like obstructions for the slow rivulets of water that run along the floor.  Discolored oak posts brace this part of the passage in an attempt to prevent the ceiling from caving in.  The openings of several old burial tombs cut into the wall are filled with earthen debris and bone remnants."
