    "Sheltered from the elements, the entry to the Needle of Pentas is wreathed in an arched trellis arbor of bright white that is blanketed in ice white climbing roses.  Carefully hidden amid the verdant leaves, frosted globes shine brightly and dispel the encroaching darkness of the night.  Crushed sea shells line the pathway of the garden, the rainbow-hues of their nacre dazzling in the moonlight."
