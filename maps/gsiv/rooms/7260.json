    "The walls of the small vestibule are formed of solid slabs of granite, mottled in dark and light grey and a deep mossy green that almost matches the color of the creeping fingers of lichen that spread up from the dirt-covered stone floor on every side.  The north wall is a pile of rubble and broken stone, some age-old landslide having obscured whatever passage may lie beyond.  A large grey stone slab lies half-buried in the rubble, as if an attempt to unearth it had gone unfinished long ago."
