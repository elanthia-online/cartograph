    "Grey stone, speckled with small patches of soft moss, spreads across the boneyard in a wide swath.  Moonlight washes the rock in a faint white glow.  Few bones lie on the rock, but broken bits of bone line the rock like small bits of gravel.  A large crack streaks through the stone, threatening to break the rock in two.",
