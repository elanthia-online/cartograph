    "Several torches in silver sconces are placed about the walls.  Near an ora-bound door sits a supply rack filled with a variety of blades, pole-arms, and shields, and a small sandalwood bar with a gold-threaded tapestry hanging high above it rests in one corner.  The back wall holds three chiseled stone statues near a broad window overlooking the performer's courtyard.  In the center of the room stands a circular ironwood table with cushioned mahogany chairs positioned around it."
