    "Smaller trees and shrubs abound in the area, filling the forest and making travel impossible in any direction except along the road.  Where many of the large trees might have once stood, only charred trunks extend up toward the sky.  From all appearances a fire moved through this area, but not recently.  The extent of the undergrowth and the size of many of the smaller trees indicate that the fire may have scoured the area three years ago or so."
