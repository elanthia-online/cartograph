    "Short wooden stools are scattered fairly evenly around the cabin, making it hard to approach the glaes podium near the far wall.  Two particularly short halflings, one wearing an eyepatch and the other missing both a leg and an arm, stand guard beside the podium.  They appear to be, at once, both vigilant and sleepy."
