    "The ornate facade of a guild hall stands back from the var, clad in blue-grey granite and carved in heavy relief.  A wide variety of gargoyles grin from their perches atop window embrasures, doorframes, and rainspouts.  A few gargoyles dance gleefully across the blue tiled rooftop as the moonlight bathes their forms in silvery light.",
