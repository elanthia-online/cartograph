    "A sphere-hilted mounted sword plaque hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  An elegantly woven reed mat sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is a long carved oak counter on one side of the shop and a Vornavian silk-lined display case on the other."
