    "Cramped and dim, the display room shows signs of hasty construction, and the canvas eastern wall flaps from where it has torn free of its stakes.  A single lantern illuminates the wares for sale in a wide oak chest, while simultaneously casting shadows upon the items hanging from a series of display hooks suspended from the sycamore walls.  Despite the closeness, or perhaps because of it, there is a decided warmth to the air due to the work of a coal-filled brazier left in the center of the space."
