    "A dark wood workbench rests in the center of the polished granite room.  Three beams of moonlight offer illumination to the chamber, coming from three narrow windows set halfway up one of the walls.  A large dead spider lies in the corner of the room, its legs curled up and over its body, just beneath a niche set into the wall."
