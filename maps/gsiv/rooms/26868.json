    "The lane narrows noticeably as it slopes northwestward.  A building along the side of the road is streaked with a sticky, shiny substance that is slowly dripping from the pine that leans precariously over it.  A dark alleyway stands between two somewhat dilapidated buildings on the western side of the street."
