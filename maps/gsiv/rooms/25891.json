    "Slightly L-shaped, the clay walls here have been smoothed carefully, then panoramically-carved with many figures of armor-clad women bearing weapons.  A large black marble slab table paired with wooden benches extends the length of the room.  One silver iron oil lamp shaped to resemble the pool in the shrine above sits centered on the table, its single flame burning brightly."
