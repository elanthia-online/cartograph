  "description": [
    "Watery cascades end their downward journey into a wide streambed that constricts into a much narrower channel in one direction.  That strait courses through a thin cleft in the coastal cliffs, presumably to the ocean beyond.  Silt built up on the eastern side of the broad pool, where the flow into the tight runnel is completely cut off, has created an alluvial delta.  The fertile triangle boasts a plethora of ribbits that emanate from within an unparalleled variety of bulrushes and cattails."
