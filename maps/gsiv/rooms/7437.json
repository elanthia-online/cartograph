  "description": [
    "Huge boulders and jagged rocks are the predominant features on the vast plain that stretches out to the east.  The high, sheer cliff which looms above you to the west and southwest is clean and straight, as if cut with some gargantuan knife.  The cliff face is featureless, except for a small, jagged opening at the base of the cliff."
