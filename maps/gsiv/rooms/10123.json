    "Lakebed rocks become more prominent along this offshoot of the trail, as though more recently maintained.  The dark rich stones sport a mottled hue speared with alabaster veins.  The pass meanders east a short distance before a steep ledge cuts it off, descending into a deep gully and down to the edge of a morose-looking swamp.  Forbidding scents waft outward, festooning its banks like a decorative collar."
