  "description": [
    "A collection of thin and translucent dripstone formations twist to form variegated stone flowers that gleam brilliantly from the light magnified by the large deposits of crystals in the vaulted chamber.  Underneath, a large granite semi-circular desk sits alongside large iron braziers that bear hot coals to warm the room.  Furs are spread across the floor in luxurious splendor.  A gilded coat of arms of the Warrior Guild hangs prominently behind the desk."
