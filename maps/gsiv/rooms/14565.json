  "description": [
    "Along the backdrop of the painted sky, deep azure lapis lazuli veined with milky quartz and flecked with pyrite is carved into a simple scroll-shaped altar top.  Three gold pegasus statues sit back to back, balancing the richly hued stone slab upon the upper curves of their wings.  Thin rivulets of water stream forth from the open jaws, and fill a ringed trough surrounding the raised platform beneath their hooves."
