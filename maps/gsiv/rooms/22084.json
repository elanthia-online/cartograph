  "description": [
    "Many of Elanthia's finest artisans have contributed their talents to create this large amphitheater.  Terraced seating comprised of blue cushions arranged on oak benches descends to the floor in concentric circles.  A raised speaker's podium occupies the center of the hall.  The walls of the amphitheater are adorned with paintings of elaborate landscapes and sweeping vistas.",
    "Two wide marble terraces lined with blue and gold runners sink down to a polished ebonwood dance floor.  The top terrace opposite the arches leading out is partially enclosed by gilded railing, reserving space for musicians with music stands at the ready.  Low couches and plush chairs are scattered in small groupings among the terraces, inviting conversation.  Colorful silk and velvet tapestries adorn the walls, lending a festive air."
