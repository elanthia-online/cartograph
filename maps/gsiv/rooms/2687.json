  "description": [
    "The scarred face of the glacier is dotted with rock and an occasional collection of bones, shriven by the wind to a white as pure as the snow.  The path curves northeast, skirting a large rock and ice outcrop.  To the south, it meanders through a field of snow-covered boulders strewn across the head of the glacier like pebbles, making the track more haphazard and dangerous."
