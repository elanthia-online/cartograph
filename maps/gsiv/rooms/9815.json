    "A very faint, flickering light filters in from above, fending off the encroaching darkness that threatens to consume the area.  The cramped surroundings are littered with the remnants of fallen sconces, the stone objects shattered into jagged shards.  Only a few remain aloft to combat the invasive shadows.  Small roots twist their way along the walls, their pale needle-thin forms creating delicate swirling patterns upon the earth."
