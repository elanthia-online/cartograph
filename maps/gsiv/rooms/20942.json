    "Sandy earth outlines the river, mixing with the sea to create a thriving saltwater marsh.  A variety of crabs skitter about the water's edge, leaving tiny dotted tracks.  Small fish, snails, and oysters can be seen in the clear shallow water.  Tall leafy plants enclose the marsh, only hinting at the ocean beyond.  A mango grove thrives nearby, giving shelter to the long-legged birds that call the marsh their home."
