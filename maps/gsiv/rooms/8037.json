    "A white sprinkle of lilies of the valley, intermingled with a few cloudberry bushes, covers the marshy ground.  A few stark-white birch trees grow nearby, blending in well with the fragrant flowers.  The soil is so soggy that you almost get stuck in it with every step you take.  Someone has had the forethought to place a few planks across a particularly forbidding area."
