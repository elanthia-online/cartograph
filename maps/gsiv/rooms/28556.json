  "description": [
    "Tremblors strong enough to dislodge unsecured bits of the stone walls roil beneath the black sands underfoot, and a resonate groaning fills the air, tremendous and concussive.  Unrelenting, the clamor is reflected in the sky, where a gnarled finger of red-violet lightning stretches the length of the crimson skyline.  For just a moment, the formidable countenance of a towering spire is illuminated in the distance, but as the flash fades, it recedes into the darkness once more."
