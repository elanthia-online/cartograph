    "A large bed covered with a thick blue comforter sits with a beautifully rendered chart of the local coastline hanging over its head.  Several other charts are mounted on the other walls.  A nice view of the bay is visible through a large window framed by blue curtains.  A wooden table with the design of compass points carved in it and blue upholstered chairs with sit under the open window."
