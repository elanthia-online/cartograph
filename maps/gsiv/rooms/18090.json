    "The entryway to this shop is akin to a being at the hub of a series of interconnected pipes.  Dimly lit narrow tunnels extend in several directions, and all emit a cacophony of sounds, both machine and organic.  A thick layer of glaes pebbles covers the ground and reflects tiny motes of light that radiate from rows of glimaerstones attached to the arched ceilings.  Hanging from the ceiling in the center of the room is a curved sign that reads the same no matter which angle it is viewed from."
