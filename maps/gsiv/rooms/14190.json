    "A gold-veined black marble altar rests atop a dais of twelve shallow steps, the altar's surface has been carved to resemble paving stones radiating from a gate of polished jet that rises at the altar's rear.  A faceted sunstone key, almost as long as a giantman's stride, floats in mid-air before the gate."
