  "description": [
    "Numerous long structures dot the more northern ends of the pier, while nothing but sea and the coast stretch for untold miles opposite of it.  Shifting shadows play across the weathered wooden planks of the pier, and the sharp steps of a few travelers occasionally break the silence that hangs in the air.  Several ships are moored at the end of the pier here, their outlines vaguely illuminated in the pale moonlight."
