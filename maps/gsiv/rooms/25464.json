    "The sound of water flow is loud here, echoing in layers to form a constant ambient rushing noise.  The embers from a long dead fire are scattered across the stone floor, originating from a ring of stones off in one corner.  A rotting bedroll in another corner has been gnawed on by several generations of rats, their feces and bones littering the moldering cloth.  From a niche in the wall, a lone candle illuminates much of the small room, leaving only the tunnel leading out to remain in the shadows."
