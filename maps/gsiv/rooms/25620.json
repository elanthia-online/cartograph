  "description": [
    "Smoke from nearby homes drifts out over the water and flows along with the current.  A half-finished canoe, hewn from a felled birch, rests on wooden trestles near the west bank.  Another watercraft, bowl-shaped and fashioned from tightly woven rushes, sits nearby with a crudely-shaped oar leaning against its rim.  The slow-moving water creates little sound, allowing bird songs and various animal skitterings to be easily heard."
