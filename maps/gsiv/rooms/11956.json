  "description": [
    "The woods form the walls of a natural maze, confusing direction and senses.  Soft green moss covers most of the trees and extends across the trail.  The overhead cover is fairly thick, stunting the growth of normal plants down on the ground.  Clear openings lie to the north and south."
