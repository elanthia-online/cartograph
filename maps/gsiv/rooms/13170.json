    "The entry of Eonak's temple is a low, expansive chamber resting beneath a ceiling of steel-reinforced ironwood girders.  Sooty and dark, the complex interplay of metal and wood colludes to support a windowed central dome.  Motes of ash filter through the sunlight streaming in, giving breadth and depths to the shafts of brilliance illuminating the temple interior.  Unlit braziers mark brown-carpeted walks to the east and west.",
