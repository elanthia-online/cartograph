  "description": [
    "The enclosure of the leaf-covered arch suddenly gives way to an expansive, sloped clearing surrounded by a lush grove of towering oaks.  Natural stone benches are carved into the landscape and descend towards a low-rise wooden stage.  Moonlight filtering through the canopy of the trees places a natural spotlight onto the stage, and dozens of lanterns hang in the oaks that border the area.  To the right of the stage sits a beautifully carved oak lectern."
