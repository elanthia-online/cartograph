    "The soil underfoot is soft and gives in places.  More than a few holes are visible, likely the result of pulling rhubarb plants up from the ground, judging by the littering of rhubarb leaves and flowers off to one side of the empty field.  Several colorful tents in the area are strung with brightly colored balloons."
