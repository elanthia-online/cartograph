    "The columnar stone shaft of an old well punctures the vaulted ceiling above and extends about halfway to the ground.  Directly beneath is the glassy surface of a spring-fed lake of unsurpassed crystalline beauty.  Diffuse light refracts off the lake and casts multihued reflections on the walls, as though filtered through a thousand tiny prisms of Elven devising.  The scene is so enchanting, you almost forget the harsh, muffled sounds echoing down the well."
