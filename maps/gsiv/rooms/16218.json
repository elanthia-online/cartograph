  "description": [
    "The tunnel angles toward the distant sound of revelry, music and laughter mingled in a fluctuating buzz.  Soft light from bee-shaped lanterns overhead falls on two round doors each set in a small alcove.  An attractive pattern of tiles paving the walk mimics octagonal sections of a hive."
