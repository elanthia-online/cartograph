    "[Tunnel, The Breach]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Feeble torchlight from beyond a breached white brick wall holds the darkness of the tunnel at bay, but only barely, and its heat is a distant memory only paces away.  An oppressive, deep chill suffuses the air and moist walls of the tunnelway, and the entire place stinks of death and rot.  The walls are rough and crude, as if hastily dug, and are scored with claw marks."
