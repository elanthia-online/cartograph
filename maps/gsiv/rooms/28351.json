    "Stained in an ethereal red light, the source of which is unlocatable, the arena is bordered by obsidian claws that stretch into a stormy sky.  Lightning flashes at irregular intervals, illuminating dehydrated corpses with mouths frozen in screams of horror and vacant eye sockets where their ocular tenants have rotted away.  Cracked and scattered with a clay-like sand, the ground is uneven and treacherous."
