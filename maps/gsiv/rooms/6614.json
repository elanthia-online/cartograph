  "description": [
    "This alcove is a small, octagonal room.  The ceiling is arched and richly adorned with murals, their colors still vivid, resulting from the preservative absence of light.  They depict a fascinating panorama of satyrs and nymphs, cavorting through a fantastic wooded landscape.  A substantial door dominates the alcove, its modwir beams crossed with thick iron bands.  There is a faint outline of strange symbols across the door's surface."
