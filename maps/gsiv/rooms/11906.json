  "description": [
    "Tree-dotted hillsides rise on both sides of the path, providing ample cover for the wildlife living in the woods.  The road here is mostly flat as it meanders along the city plateau, although there is a slight incline to the north.  One especially large modwir tree lies fallen near the edge of the road, its roots helplessly exposed."
