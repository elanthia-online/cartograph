    "[A Mismatched Canvas Shelter]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Patchworked and mismatched, the bright canvas of the shelter stretches from railing-to-railing while its roof hugs the mast.  Carefully arranged piles of clutter bridge the gap between the chipped wooden floor and the bottom of the tightly tacked fabric, though faint moonlight still peeks through.  Positioned at the exact center of the open space is an elaborately carved cabinet that is lashed to the mast."
