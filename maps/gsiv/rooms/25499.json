    "A meshwork of veniom cables threads across the wooden bulkheads to either side of a sealed hatchway in the western wall.  Vivid blue-green light pulses through the frame of the hatch, accompanied by a persistent thrum that disturbs the air, like thunder without sound.  The light travels through the cabling, which bores into the body of the ship at points along the hull."
