  "description": [
    "Row upon row of clear crystal glasses varying in shape and size line the wall behind a long cherrywood bar, which is attended by a well-dressed elven wine attendant.  To one side of the bar is a scrollworked, dark wine rack which displays the vintages available.  Some soft colorful cushions provide a place to rest, enjoy the wines, and discuss their qualities."
