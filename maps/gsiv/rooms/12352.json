    "Hollystoned to the color of pale honey, the oak planking here in the waist of the vessel stretches from the base of the forecastle to the break of the aftcastle.  The expanse of deck is interrupted by the polished ashwood-and-glaes mass of the main capstan, the white glaes gratings of the two main cargo hatches, and the base of the main mast.  From here ladders lead up to the aftcastle deck, the fo'csle castle deck forward, and down to the maindeck below."
