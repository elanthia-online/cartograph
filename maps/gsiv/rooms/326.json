    "The heavy wood-planked bridge is old, but stands steady against the deep, dark river waters on massive stone pilings below.  Rope railings attached to weathered wooden posts are the only guard against a cold plunge in the Locksmehr, but the span is wide enough to bear the traffic without mishap.  The shadowy profiles of wooden buildings dot the east bank, and to the west lies the more heavily populated main part of town.",
