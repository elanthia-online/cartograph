    "A frigid blast of air sends a chill down your spine, and the hair on the nape of your neck stands on end from the energies flowing around the cavern.  Light is coming from numerous phosphorescent crystals protruding from the floor and ceiling, in a multitude of colors.  The crystals are connected to each other by strands of pure energy that seem to emanate somehow from an underground stream that flows through here.   Carved into one stone wall is a stone counter, and a few stone bar stools cluster around it."
