    "Giant toadstools tower, shedding a pale blue luminescence upon this slight bend of the tunnel, causing diminutive veins of black opal to shimmer faintly.  Hanging above the numerous brightly-colored doors are boldly painted signs advertising each merchant's names.  The faint aroma of cigar smoke filters in from a small niche frequented by resting miners."
