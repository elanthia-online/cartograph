    "The swirling waters of the river have created a deep swimming hole here, lined on the banks with small wildflowers and carpeted with waving green water plants.  Fish swim about your legs, darting away at the slightest move towards them.  The water is briskly chilly, giving you prickly goosebumps all over."
