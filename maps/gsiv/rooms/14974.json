    "Moonlight streams through the stained glass panels of the half-roof rising on both sides.  The center is missing, leaving the hall open to the sky.  Heavily polished walnut supports arch gracefully from the sides of this oval chamber to meet in pairs high overhead.  Tiers of silver and black benches march down and forward to confront a sterling silver dais backed by a huge canvas banner.  Torches mounted on long poles stretch out from the supports and over the benches, their flames flickering brightly.",
