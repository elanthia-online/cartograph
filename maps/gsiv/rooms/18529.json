  "description": [
    "The scent of warm, freshly baked bread envelops you as you enter the tidy shop.  The stifling heat from the oven is subdued by a gentle spring breeze that wafts through an open door leading out into a tiny herb garden.  Piping hot baked goods are neatly arrayed on some oak shelves around the room, and there is a cloth-covered table sitting in the corner."
