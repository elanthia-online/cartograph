  "description": [
    "Separated from the corridor by a low archway, the alcove houses neat little piles of nautical instruments.  Some sturdy wooden shelves adorn the wall behind a bowed modwir table, each topped with various wares for sale.  Opposite the desk is a heavy oak desk, upon which neatly folded maps are piled.  A single lantern hangs from the center of the ceiling, casting a dull glow down on the scene."
