    "Bright yellow canvas has been draped across thin iron poles, which also intersect directly in the center of the ceiling.  Displaying the goods for sale is a tiered table on one end of the tent, while on the other is a stand with makeshift shelves.  A tattered thick cotten rug with a faded image serves to smooth out the otherwise rough ground."
