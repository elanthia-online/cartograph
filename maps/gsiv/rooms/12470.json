    "A cart has broken down in the road here, one of its wheels collapsed.  The two giantman drovers don't seem too worried, however.  They're far more concerned that their cargo, several split and half-spilled ale casks, not go to waste.  It looks like they're going to be here a while.  To the south is an entrance to the park."
