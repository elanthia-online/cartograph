    "You stand in the shallow waters of an underground lake.  You can feel a slight current flowing around your legs.  A few cave fish float about in the water around you.  Along the cave walls here you see more of the lightly glowing lichen.  The light from the lichen gives the water an unusual hue, that plays tricks on your eyes.  Every now and then, you see something dart past you, underwater. This is as deep as you'd like to go."
