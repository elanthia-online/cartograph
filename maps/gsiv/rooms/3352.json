    "The dome of the expansive fieldstone edifice to the north is painted such a brilliant white that even the weak northern sunlight is blinding on it.  Snowdrifts standing waist high to a halfling line the walkway leading to the arched doors of the building, yet the flagstones of the walk are curiously dry and free of ice.  A footbridge spans a narrow, fast-moving stream that rushes in a sweeping arc around the cylindrical building.",
    "The dome of the expansive fieldstone edifice to the north is painted such a brilliant white that it nearly glows from the starlight reflected off it.  The dark shapes of snowdrifts standing waist high to a halfling line the walkway leading towards the building.  A footbridge spans a stream that you hear swiftly rushing along below in the dark somewhere."
