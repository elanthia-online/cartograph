    "Pale white marble tiles line a long counter installed with a frosted glass basin at one end, the shelves underneath stocked with folded cotton cloths monogrammed in silvery thread.  As if an invitation to relax, a pillow-topped chaise lounge covered in pale silk sprawls out in front of a full-length mirror.  Soft light streams through a round window and onto a glass-topped cherrywood vanity neatly arranged with bottles and brushes."
