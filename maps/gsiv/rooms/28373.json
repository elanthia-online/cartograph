    "Less than a hand width of natural monir flooring shows at the edges of this small room, the rest disappearing underneath a thick pad covered with light grey linen.  In the center of the room, a short jade pedestal provides a splash of color to the austere setting.  A tiny white porcelain fountain atop the pedestal bubbles with clear water, the soothing sound echoing lightly from the grey-veined marble walls."
