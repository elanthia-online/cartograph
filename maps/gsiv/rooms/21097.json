    "Surrounded in a halo of sunlight, which breaks through the canopy above, is this quiet cemetery.  A series of broken grave markers covered in thick moss break through the wild grass at odd angles, their faces smooth and without ornamentation.  Resting upon a slender stone dais at the center of the cemetery is a carved green marble statue.  Water gurgles up around the base of the statue to create a stream that cuts through the jungle to the north and west.  A thin track leads into the jungle.",
