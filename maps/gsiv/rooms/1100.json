    "The way is flat and solid around the plateau's edge, and the edge itself provides a familiar landmark by which to navigate.  A scuffed surface runs off to the northeast at this point, though, winding between two parallel crevices deep into the plateau's interior.  No signs, messages or carvings indicate why the path exists and, judging from the lack of fearsome creatures encountered thus far, exploring it might not prove particularly dangerous."
