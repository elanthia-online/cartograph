    "The cracks and crevices that dominate the interior scurry closer to the edge here, many of them yawning widely as if hoping for something to accidentally fall into their ever-agape maws.  In places two or more crevices cross, leaving strange-looking islands of rock to stand, giving the impression of rock platforms suspended in midair.  One particularly large crevice winds close, and something white flickers up from it every so often before disappearing quickly back down inside."
