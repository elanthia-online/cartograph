    "Down a short corridor waits the bustling kitchen, busy with scullery maids and cooks preparing the daily meals.  Doors open at the far end lead out into the garden for harvesting herbs and vegetables, and the back wall is dominated by massive riverstone ovens, set with clay brick trivets, glowing with the fragrant fire from local applewood.  Cupboards and shelves are filled with neatly labeled supplies, and near the entry is a black cast iron stove and a polished copper kettle, for brewing various beverages."
