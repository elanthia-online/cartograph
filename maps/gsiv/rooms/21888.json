    "Patterned walls of red and yellow squares spread out through the tent, held upright by carved white oak posts.  Wooden shelves, high and low, stretch the length of every wall.  A circular rosewood counter is centered in the middle of the room and holds an assortment of pastries and other treats.  Near the back sits a large hand-carved rosewood trunk."
