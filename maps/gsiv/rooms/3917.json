    "Weaving along in a haphazard pattern, the tunnel threads through a series of rock columns.  Each is carved in the image of a tree trunk, with finely rendered bark, branches and an impossibly complex pattern of leaves overhead.  The sculpted tree boles stand solemnly like an army of frozen sentries.  Above, the leaves intertwine in an abundance that staggers the imagination."
