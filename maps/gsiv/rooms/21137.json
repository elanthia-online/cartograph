  "description": [
    "Built into an unused sewer nexus, the cobble walls of the dinning chamber are painted stark white.  Cushion-topped stools surround a circular driftwood bar beneath the warm glow of frosted orbs that are suspended from the azure ceiling.  Private alcoves occupy each of the north, east, west, and south-facing walls, while a blackened iron ladder resting in the northwest corner leads to the upper levels."
