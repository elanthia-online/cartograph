    "Turnips grow abundantly, their leaves spreading out in small canopies above the widening root crowns.  As evidenced by the dead weeds and disturbed soil between the turnip rows, this section has recently seen the passing of the hoe.  Live weeds still crowd the edges of the patch, looking over their fallen comrades expressionlessly, but they are unable to do anything about the uprooted weeds' plights."
