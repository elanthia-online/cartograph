    "Crammed into the back corner of the warehouse, a pile of signs can be discerned off to the side.  The entire back wall is filled with huge shipping crates and other assortment of packaging.  Shipping clerks roam throughout moving boxes and inventory around, causing a large ruckus that echoes throughout the warehouse."
