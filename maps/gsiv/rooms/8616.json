    "Iron Jack's boasts four well-sized forges, three of which are currently in operation.  Several new apprentices are gathered around one, learning the finer points of Smithery, while the blacksmith's eldest son is crafting a large sword at another.  At the third forge, two older apprentices are working on shorter blades suitable for knives."
