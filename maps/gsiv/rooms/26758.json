    "The curtained alcove of the pavilion is small and austere, utterly unadored save for a lantern glowing brightly overhead.  Underfoot is a thin layer of carpeting in a mottle grey hue, and a braided silver cord secures the curtained opening.  Several torn stubs of raffle tickets litter the carpet."
