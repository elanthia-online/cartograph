    "As this path winds in toward the interior of the island, the earthen wall farthest from the water has given way in an eroding slide.  Crickets sing in a cacaphony of pitches, and tiny fireflies flit about like winking stars against an indigo sky.  Soft moonlight barely illuminates the rocky egress.",
    "As this path winds in toward the interior of the island, the earthen wall farthest from the water has given way in an eroding slide.  Roots from trees and bushes snare like gnarled fingers reaching out in a death grasp, and stripes of shale and clay layer in monotone hues just above a base of bedrock."
