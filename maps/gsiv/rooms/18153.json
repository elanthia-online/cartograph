    "Glittering sparks of crimson and cerulean surround you in this circular room -- the entirety of the walls are crafted from a deep purple crystal that arcs downward in an elliptical pattern of spires toward the center of the chamber.  A dark orb sits atop a pedestal of black onyx, its slick surface mere inches from the central crystal spoke jutting from the ceiling.  Slivers of incarnadine shot with violet tracing arc through the rift between the two, sending whirring hums of power echoing about you."
