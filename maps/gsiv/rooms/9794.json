    "The air in this tunnel holds a light scent of decay, the encroaching walls nearly concealing a humanoid skeleton stretched out within the earth.  Dark moss grows upon the ceiling, a few of the deep green trails hanging over the bones peeking out of the dirt.  Tiny drops of moisture form at the top of the walls, trickling down in thin rivulets."
