    "The town walls lie perhaps one hundred feet to the north, with dwarven militiamen pacing back and forth atop them.  A rock garden to the west displays a wide variety of fascinating boulders.  Beyond the garden, a barge makes its way south down the River Muagh, its decks piled high with freshly-cut logs.  To the east Glaes Street, lined with small wood and stone homes, continues a few hundred feet to the walls of the canyon."
