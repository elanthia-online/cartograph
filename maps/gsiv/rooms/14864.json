    "The trail widens into a circle beneath a thick, shadowy cover of aspen boughs.  There stands an immense arch, its pillars densely carved with sigils.  The surface is pitted with time.  Its incongruous location, beneath the graceful aspen canopy, implies the unpredictability of life's paths and the finality of the last gateway.",
