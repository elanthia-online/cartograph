  "description": [
    "A pair of large statues support a heavy marble block over the boulevard, forming a great stone arch.  To the southwest you can see the beginnings of a once prosperous market district, while to the southeast the fallen buildings were clearly once fine and majestic residences.  Troughs, once used to water all manner of riding beasts, lie clogged with dirt and ash along the edge of the road."
