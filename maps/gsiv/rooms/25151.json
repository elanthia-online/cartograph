  "description": [
    "A towering black ora gate spans an opening between two massive sand-blasted walls, marking the southern perimeter of the open courtyard.  Huge slabs of bone white sandstone spread concentrically outward from a seal of bronze and copper branding the ground before the gateway.  Hot sunlight glints off of the disk's surface, outlining a tangle of serpents etched into its face."
