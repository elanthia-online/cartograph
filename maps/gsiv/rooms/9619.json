    "Driftwood is scattered all over this sand bar at the confluence of the Locksmehr River's two channels.  The sand has been pushed up in a wide, triangular-shaped patch, mostly by the action of the western channel which sweeps by, depositing whatever it is carrying onto the bar.  Further south the two flows collide in rolling riffles and swirling eddies, fighting, combining, then charging on downstream as one river."
