  "description": [
    "Slick moss clings to the limestone walls, spreading outward like some sort of disease.  The room appears to just end, leaving the only egress to be outward.  Recent footprints have marred the algae-stained floor, leading up to the north wall and ending abruptly -- several round metal discs are set into the floor and are spread across the antechamber."
