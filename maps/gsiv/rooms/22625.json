    "This area at the rear of the wagon is separated from the rest by an opaque violet-on-black curtain, across from which is a narrow ladder that leads upward into a loft-styled bed.  Beneath sits a wing-backed aubergine velvet chair, and nearby is a pedestal table supporting a smooth, leather-covered journal and a raven feather quill."
