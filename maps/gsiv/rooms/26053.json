    "Pale silk walls give way to a series of large, rounded windows that bathe the room in sunlight.  A massive canopy bed dominates the bedchamber, draped with alabaster gauze, its luxurious silk spread is a sapphire blue embroidered with a silver jacquard pattern.  Covering the floor is a thick shag rug woven with various shades of ivory and fitted into a deep recess on the far wall is a wide mistwood dresser.  Suspended from a silver chain is a beautiful crystal lamp, its surface etched with blooming roses."
