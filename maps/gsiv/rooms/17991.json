  "description": [
    "This wide chamber somehow looks both sumptuous and businesslike at the same time.  Stout monir beams cross the vaulted ceiling.  At one end of the chamber, facing the door is a long worktable.  In a small, arched recess behind the worktable is a prayer rug.  Wide windows covered with ornate brass grills are open to the air."
