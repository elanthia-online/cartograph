  "description": [
    "Resembling an octopus in shape, the study hall has eight narrow tunnels branching off in a variety of directions and two large globes anchored into the stucco ceiling offering cheerful illumination.  Five of the tunnels are curtained for privacy, while the remaining three remain open for public use.  A braided rug rests underneath a carved soapstone table that has a mosaic-inlay of colorful tiles and is surrounded by comfortable linden chairs topped with deep blue cushions."
