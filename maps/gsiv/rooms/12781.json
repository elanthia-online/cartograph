    "Within the circle of columns lies a well, its bottom invisible in the darkness that overtakes its depths a short distance beneath its rim.  The rim is level with the floor slabs, offering no break between the floor and the fathoms of empty air beyond.  A repeating pattern of symbols is worked in mosaic around the hole."
