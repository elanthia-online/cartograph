    "A beech tree with wide branches reaches toward the thick green canopy above, adding its leaves to the tapestry of green.  A carpet of moss and flowers softens footsteps, and the steady cadence of gentle dripping adds percussion to the sounds of jungle birds in the branches high above.  A woven ladder of natural fibers dangles near the mighty tree, nearly camouflaged with the pale bark of its trunk."
