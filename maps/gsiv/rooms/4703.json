  "description": [
    "Devoid of windows, most of the stand-lamps are lit in the dining hall managing to chase away some of the shadows.  A single mural on the wall depicts two male aelotoi and a single female standing before the Sapphire Throne.  Rows of tables in perfect symmetry are arranged in the interior of the room with fruit bowls set in the center of each table containing apples, oranges, bananas, and grapes.  Mouth-watering aromas waft in from the open kitchen door at the back of the room, where a life-sized figure stands."
