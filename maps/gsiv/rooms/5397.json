    "What might have been a fountain or sculpture at one time now lies ruined in several jagged pieces upon the ground, most of the stone debris blackened as if hit by lightning.  The brush surrounding the artwork is hardly more than ash now, giving further evidence that something malevolent might have occured in this area."
