  "description": [
    "On the jetty, between the shore and open sea, the surrounding mists swirl and thicken to obscure massive granite blocks, slippery with sea spray and tilting at awkward angles, winding out into the choppy waters.  Occasional waves burst up from the sides of the walkway, the wicked winds casting white foam across the weathered stones."
