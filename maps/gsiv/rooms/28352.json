    "Slight tendrils of mist reach out from the dark lake to the south, stretching lazily through the gloom towards a huge moonstone building.  Two slender spires rise gracefully from the structure, and the crimson summit of a third tower peeks above the smooth dome that crowns the abbey.  A thin marble walkway, pale in the moonlight, ends in two imposing ebonwood doors, unfettered by the verdant ivy that clusters so thickly on the walls."
