    "Grey-green stalks rise up in straight lines from the rich, brown soil toward the sky.  Their reach toward the heavens, however, seems to have been interrupted, given the obvious cuts that the plants have sustained; their heads are missing, but the stems remain.  Several triangular artichoke leaves litter the ground.  Making its way toward the center of the fields, a narrow, dusty path is marked at the edges with small red tags."
