    "Little remains of the retaining wall that once held back the lapping currents of the river.  Water sloshing over the banks has turned the road into a long narrow mud puddle punctuated by occasional slabs of stone.  Dark, jagged silhouettes of once lofty towers rise above the ruins to the south of the path.",
