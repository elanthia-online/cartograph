    "Nestled within this stone-walled courtyard is a frosty garden of holly and hummock grass shaded by a knobby pine tree.  An old stump serves as a primitive altar, its level top crowded with candle stubs and offerings.  Draped from the overhanging tree limbs are strings of tiny bells which chime with every gusting breath of wind.",
