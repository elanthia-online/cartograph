    "The corridor doglegs to the southwest, growing more open and less shadowy in that direction.  A marked descent devours the northern section, wrapping the corridor in deep gloom and stale air.  Walls, ceiling and floor bear a repeating pattern of ridges, as if the hallway has become the gullet of some immense creature, waiting silently for the right moment to swallow any unsuspecting trespassers."
