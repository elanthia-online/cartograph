    "Occupying the space between a high shale wall and the back of a hastily constructed shop, the small alley is a temporary shelter from the wind and is brightly illuminated by torches that help stave off the gloom of the island.  Crates and boxes are stacked high on three of the four sides of the alley, a sign tacked to one of them, while a small oak table and chair are arranged in the center.  Strung between the boxes, and anchored by more boxes, is a colorful braided wool hammock with a bright green tarp positioned over it.",
