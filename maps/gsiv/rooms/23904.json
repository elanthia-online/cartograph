    "A patchwork covering is perched precariously overhead, made of a myriad scraps of fabric and strung between branches with bits of twine.  The excess is left to fall in great swathes to enclose the round platform nestled in the cradle of several large branches, and miniscule tears and openings in the fabric allow in thin shafts of pale moonlight.  Smaller limbs and branches encircle the platform, while a narrow rope bridge leads deeper into the tree's canopy."
