    "The glaring whiteness of the snow has been stained a grimy drab gray color on this leg of the path.  Oily flakes have mottled almost every inch of the landscape here, though there is no evidence of anything that could have been their origin.  The wind whips the ashes about, making breathing difficult in the bitter-cold air."
