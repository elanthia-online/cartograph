  "description": [
    "Mosses and wildflowers grow between the massive paving stones, clothing the rough edges of naked broken rock with brilliant green.  The trees press close to both sides of the avenue, their roots buckling the roadway into hills and valleys.  A southerly wind carries the thick scent of animal musk, but the forest is silent and belies the presence of any sentient thing within it.",
    "Mosses and wildflowers grow between the massive paving stones, softening the rough edges of the broken rock.  The trees press close to both sides of the avenue, occluding the moonlight almost totally and leaving only the path itself visible in the dim light.  A southerly wind carries the thick scent of animal musk, but even at night the forest is silent and belies the presence of any sentient thing within it."
