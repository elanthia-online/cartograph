    "Framed by hanging curtains of burgundy velvet, a wide archway marks the forward end of the main deck.  It bears a rim of red brass and gold with a stylized phoenix of red lacquer at the zenith.  Nearby, a cross-hatched burnt sienna door breaks the paneled uniformity of the hallway's starboard wall."
