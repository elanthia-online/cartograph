  "description": [
    "Turquoise and saffron tiles create a checkered pattern through the small patio, which is surrounded by a bounty of brightly colored flowers and oversized plants.  White benches nearly disappear in the lush foliage of the tiny garden, while a pair of cupboards rest close to the outer walls of the cottage.  A small cooking pit, located directly opposite the cottage's entry, is surrounded by baking bricks and cast iron cookware, each stacked in neat and tidy rows."
