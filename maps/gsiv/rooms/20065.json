    "Surrounding a grassy knoll, a grove of black willow trees stretch high into the night sky.  A large opening gapes at the base of the knoll, and a large cluster of exposed roots leads inside.  Several granite slabs lie in a crumbled heap by one of the trees, possibly once gravestones that were destroyed by the willow's growth.  The remains of a sword stick up amongst the debris.",
