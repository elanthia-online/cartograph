    "Walls of silk bank this large tent, the inside well-appointed despite the temporary nature of the space.  Thick plush carpet covers the floor, the chocolate tones a perfect contrast to the vibrant hues of the walls.  A curving bronze chandelier is hung from the main tent pole, each sinuous branch lined with small tapered candles.  Sheer organza curtains partition the other areas of the large tent, and a crystal-beaded silk curtain leads into a small alcove."
