    "A snowy blanket covers the polar bear habitat, creating a winter wonderland that is perfect for the arctic creatures.  An icy platform juts into a pool of clear blue water, with an overhang trimmed with glistening icicles.  A pair of polar bears playfully splash each other in the frigid waters of the pool."
