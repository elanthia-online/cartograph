    "Rough and undyed wooden crates of all sizes have been assembled and arranged, each one sporting a fire-branded number for ease of selection.  A few crates standing next to the doors bear the same address and tufts of dried fibers used for packing peek out around the seams.  A sign with rates hangs on the wall, next to a parchment calendar circled with today's date."
