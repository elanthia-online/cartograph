    "A small bell above the entryway jingles each time a patron passes through the front door of the shop.  The square black tiles of the floor are laid out throughout the area, and a large oak counter sits off to the right of the doorway with a large sign hanging on its front.  A dark-haired woman stands behind the counter, keeping herself busy."
