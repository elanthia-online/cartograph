    "Rivulets of water flow down the pockmarked wall, following the smooth, timeworn channels in the hard rock.  A plethora of prayers, tally marks, names, and confessions have been etched into the stone surfaces, serving as a constant reminder of previous occupants.  Chunks of rocks lay scattered in the dirt, the edges on some showing extensive wear.  A stubby bit of candle sits crookedly on an excrescence in one corner.  Nearly hidden in a dim corner is an open trunk with its splintered lid propped against the wall nearby."
