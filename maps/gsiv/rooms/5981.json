    "The ground is soft and muddy, releasing a pungent burst of fetid odor when traversed.  Dead fruit trees stand slender and silent, finger-like bare branches sprouting from lifeless grey trunks.  A slight rustling in the nearby grasses indicates the presence of a slow-moving denizen of this orchard, but its exact form remains hidden in the darkness of the night.",
