    "The privet hedge on the south side of the wey has been trimmed to the height of an elven knee, providing a full view of the white granite mansion behind.  The facade has been designed to resemble a snow-capped mountain peak, and the garden below features exclusively white plants in immitation of a winter landscape.  Above a carpet of baby's breath and white clover stand clusters of white lilies, iris, and gardenias, which dazzle the eye with reflected sunlight.",

    "The silver railing on the south side of the wey is low and largely for show, providing a full view of the white marble villa behind.  The facade thrusts upwards like a snow-capped mountain peak, and the garden at its base features exclusively white plants in imitation of a winter landscape.  Above a carpet of baby's breath and white clover stand clusters of white lilies, iris, and gardenias, which blind the eye with their purity."
