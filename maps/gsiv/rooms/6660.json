    "A large tapestry depicting the image of the sunset over the Lyserian Hills, the monastary perched upon a cliff face in the forefront, dominates the eastern wall of the room.  Standing in front of the tapestry is a large, intricately carved maoral desk.  Plush puma hide carpeting lines the floor and a grey puma hide couch covered in a large bear skin sits next to the open doorway to the west.",
