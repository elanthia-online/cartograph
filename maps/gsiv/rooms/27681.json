    "Several bouquets of winter roses in matching cerulean vases serve as the centerpiece for this quiet alcove named in honor of a retired Icemulian politician.  A trio of uncomfortable-looking wooden chairs sits before an aged and faded bookcase, while a portrait labeled \"Fizelgrauf the Fine\" is nailed off-center to one wall.  The lighting is low here, provided by a solitary torch, and the sounds from the bustling hall are a bit softer, providing a respite for discussion or rest."
