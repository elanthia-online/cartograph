    "Less than half the size of Brother Welton's tent, this roofless, black canvas booth is dominated by a polished brass brazier.  A brass-bound felwood torch burns brightly in a black iron torchholder just to one side of the brazier, and a black leather oilskin hangs by a golden cord from the nearest tent pole."
