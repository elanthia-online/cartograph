    "The north, east, and south walls of this chamber have been covered with spikes which display all manner of small shields for purchase.  A cranky-looking dwarf presides over the wares and uses a long hook-tipped plank of wood to retrieve purchases from high over his head.  The tell-tale odor of grog drifts in from the west."
