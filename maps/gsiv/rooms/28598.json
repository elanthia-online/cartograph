  "description": [
    "Surrounded by a low stone wall made of remnants from previous constructions, an oddly-shaped building is almost hidden by creeping rope-like vines adorned with verdant heart-shaped leaves.  Sunlight reflects off the blackened windows, barely visible through the thickly growing vegetation.  A canted doorframe slants at a dramatic angle, and the modwir door swings open occasionally with a slight creaking sound.  Piercing the door near its top is a small, crooked lunette."
