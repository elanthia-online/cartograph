    "Butterflies flutter between the colorful blossoms of the hydrangea bushes lining the cobblestone path.  The trail begins a lazy climb up a slope to the northwest, the rolling green hills stretching to the horizon on either side.  The light scent of wildflowers drifts on the cool breeze.",
    "Fireflies, in bursts of warm yellow light, weave across the starlit sky in a hypnotic dance.  Their light, along with the pale moonlight, creates a guiding glow along the cobblestone path while the serene sounds of night creates a serenade.  The light scent of wildflowers drifts on the cool breeze."
