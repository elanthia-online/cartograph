    "Two lone torches light the way, casting little illumination in the hallway to dispel the darkness.  Rubble from the crumbling ruin walls scatters across the ground, some of it half-buried and tromped into the muck formed by water trickling down upon the piles of dirt.  The air is chilled and dank with the added moisture."
