    "Creating a narrow corridor, large bales of hay line both sides of the hurling range.  A pair of modwir poles flying brilliant, golden silk streamers flanks a rounded bright yellow target.  Even from this distance, a curled snake can be seen in the center, with rings radiating out from its body."
