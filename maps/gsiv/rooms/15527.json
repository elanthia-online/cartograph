    "Deep beneath the clear glass surface of the table is what appears to be an embedded layer of deep maroon seahorses and pink fern-like sprigs of coral.  Seashells ranging in hue from pale gold to soft ivory form a second layer underneath the first, providing a muted background for the colorful display.  A few scattered black sharks' teeth punctuate both layers to add pinpoints of contrast.  Tiny bubbles in the glass, probably imperfections, seem to be the crystallized breath of the creatures below."
