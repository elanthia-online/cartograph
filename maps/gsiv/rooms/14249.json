    "Large cushioned stone seats form a semicircle atop the ascending steps bordering the highwalk.  A nearby honeywood cart adorned with gilt boasts several refreshments.  Placed higher than the swan-marked pennants of emerald silk suspended from the overhang above, a golden sunburst on a field of crimson hangs at the apex of the walk's curve."
