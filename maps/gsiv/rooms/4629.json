    "A wrought iron railing runs the length of the western side of the corridor, preventing accidental forays into the ground floor courtyard below.  The stars are visible through a skylight set in the courtyard's arched ceiling, well above your head.  A wide arch in the outer wall leads into what appears to be a formal dining area, although several tables are placed out on the landing for patrons to enjoy the cool night air.",
