    "No light filters in through the heavy, silk-lined curtain, leaving the room in darkness save for a few burning candles upon a silver tray on the floor.  No bed is present in this space, with only a sheet-draped, narrow pallet laid upon the floor at the base of a large enclosed glass fish tank.  Shards of sea glass are laid out in a sort of mosaic picture, but the work is unfinished and its subject indecipherable."
