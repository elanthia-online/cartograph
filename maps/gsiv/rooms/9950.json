    "The grassland ends in a low cliff that runs just to the east like a giant's step up to the next level of the plain, where a smattering of shade-loving wildflowers adorn the partially sun-shielded ground.  Far in the distance, the outlines of huge birds circle over the high moors above, riding on the constant wind that whistles down from that direction.",
