    "A thin layer of ice coats the ground as far as the eye can see.  Piercing the horizon is a snow-covered mountain with two peaks.  Despite a lack of clouds in the sky, hail pelts the natural formation with great ferocity, occasionally causing a dramatic avalanche.",
    "A thin layer of white ash coats the ground as far as the eye can see.  Piercing the horizon is an erupting volcano.  A dark cloud of debris hangs in the sky, causing ash to rain down upon the plain in every single direction."
