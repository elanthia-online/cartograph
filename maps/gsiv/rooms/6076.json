    "Here, farthest from the birch tree windbreak at the wheat fields's northern border, the wind picks up speed again, forcing the wheat stalks to bend heavily under the faster gusts.  The stalks curve with the wind, and when the wind abates for a few seconds, they do not spring back to a vertical alignment.  The stalks also have fewer kernels, as the wind has interfered with the initial growth, causing dried kernels to fall and leaving the gaps in the lines."
