    "An elaborate throne sits before the swirling water of the pool.   The thing is so large it would dwarf the tallest giantman.  However, the huge shape of the stone drake behind it makes the chair look small and fragile.  It seems to be made of the same stone as that of the wyrm, and its ornamentation is a mantle of carved, interlocking sigils.  Incised upon the throne's backrest is a crown within a circle."
