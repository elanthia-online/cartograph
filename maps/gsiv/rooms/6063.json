    "The thick, deciduous forest looms close to the barley field at the western edge of the spiral.  Tall birches, walnuts, and elms peer out from their lofty places as if eyeing the farmlands and waiting to reclaim what should be rightfully theirs.  Underneath, prickly, twisting brambles press toward the barley, moving inch by inch and reclaiming small bits of land until driven back by the saw or the flame.  Weeds, the vanguards of the forest's flora troops, already raid the fields in various places."
