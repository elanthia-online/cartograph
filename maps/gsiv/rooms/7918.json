    "Nestled serenely against the western wall, a large coniferous tree grows from cracks next to a small pool of crystal clear warm water.  Vapors dance across the pool while water spills over the rim of the ledge and showers down to the canyon below.  From this vantage and with the illumination of the silvery night sky, the entire canyon is visible to the northeast and beyond, all the way to Darkstone Bay.",

Sunlight dances across the landscape revealing the lush growth of the Lower Dragonsclaw Plains and the farm land around Wehnimer's Landing."
