    "The street opens into a small, untended garden in this small niche.  Several healthy blossoms of vibrant red, orange, yellow, and blue have bloomed here, and soft, green grass covers the ground.  A row of tall oak trees forms a natural barrier to the north, marking the end of the path in that direction."
