    "Lined with thoroughly rusted mining, farming, and fishing tools, the shed's walls provide a stark contrast to the ceiling, which is strung with colorful coils of silk that barely hide the nests and spiderwebs that reside there.  Several elegant, cushioned chairs surround a small carved oak table.  Oddly, one corner of the structure seems to have been pushed away and taken over by a black ash tree's trunk, the ceiling in that area composed of its spindly branches."
