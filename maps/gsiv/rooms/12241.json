    "A giant pair of stone hands clasped together forms the immense platform underfoot.  In the distance, a small white sun illuminates the rocky landscape, glistening off the silvery water of a magnificent cascade from a cliff to the east.

    "A giant pair of stone hands clasped together forms the immense platform underfoot.  In the distance, a blazing red sun illuminates the rocky landscape, glistening off the crimson water of a magnificent cascade from a cliff to the east.  Hot steam drifts from the base of the waterfall towards the hands, coating everything in a thin layer of sweat-like mist."
