    "A detailed landscape painting hangs on one of the plain baby blue walls, and a painted nightscape ceiling rises overhead.  An ivory elven noble statue sits in one corner of a weathered cobblestone floor.  There is a gold-trimmed ebonwood chest on one side of the shop and a long mahogany rack on the other."
