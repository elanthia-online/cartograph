    "Long tables covered with crisp white linens fill the room in several orderly rows, with eight place settings carefully laid out on each side.  Elegant crystal glasses and gleaming silverware sparkle in the candlelight, giving the room quite a formal, dignified air.  A pair of swinging doors in the southeastern corner lead into the kitchen."
