    "This building's floor and walls lie hidden beneath the calcareous build-up left by generations of barnacles and sponges.  Revealed now by lantern light, the pale, skeletal remnants of the invasive wall-coverings have warped the outlines of the windows and left two sets of paired columns looking like the trunks of large, melted-wax trees.  In contrast, the newly added brass shelves, display rack, and brass table create an almost nightmarish mix of organic and manufactured that is unpleasant to the eye."
