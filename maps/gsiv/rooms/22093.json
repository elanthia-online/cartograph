    "The pub is a dark, cozy place redolent with the interwoven odors of ale, wine and stronger brews.  The mellow oak tones of floor, walls and ceiling are accented by rich oxblood-colored leather, which covers all the chairs occupying the room.  A long, low bar stretches across the back wall, and hanging just over it is a huge trophy, the snarling head of a massive black bear."
