    "Surrounded by a white picket fence, the garden has a spacious, manicured lawn.  Cultivated flowers climb trellises along the edge of the villa and frame a knotty black oak door.  Teak benches are recessed amid bushes near a white picket gate that leads to the beach.  Scattered throughout the garden are blown glass humming bird feeders and colorful witch-balls that cheerfully illuminate the area."
