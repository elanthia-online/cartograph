    "Subterranean creatures scratch furtively in fissures lining the rock walls of the tunnel, clearly heard but unseen in the ghostly light of phosphorescent lichen.  Deeper shadows between the ceiling supports mark the position of a series of round holes, each about a giantman's arm-span in diameter.  In the faint illumination, it's impossible to say whether the holes are natural formations or the product of conscious design."
