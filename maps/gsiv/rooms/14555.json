  "description": [
    "An area of heavily wooded terrain, the natural home of cave bears, has been replicated in wonderful detail, enclosed within reinforced fence of wood and metal.  Obscured by dense foliage is a rocky cave mouth, serving as a shelter for the cave bear from the prying eyes of the public."
