    "Partially concealed behind a parchment screen, the polished hardwood floor is littered with crumpled paper beneath a spindly-legged escritoire piled high with vellum and near-empty ink wells.  Sleek feathers and ostentatious plumes hang from the ceiling by nearly invisible silk threads over a small mistwood worktable in one corner."
