    "Windowless walls rise high overhead before curving inward to form a complex ogive vault.  Hanging from the central boss from a long, vaalorn chain is a single crystal sphere, glowing brightly.  Centered below is a circular crystalline plinth, large enough to serve as an altar, but completely smooth and unmarked.  To one side, a shimmering portal stands at an odd angle."
