    "Singed grass covers the ground, resembling a massive, tattered web that spreads across the area.  Thin stalks of wheat poke up from the bits of dirt the grass hasn't claimed, straight grooves in the parched, reddened earth faintly visible beneath them.  Dark wisps of sulfurous-smelling smoke rise up from some of the vegetation, becoming blurred by the harsh waves of heat emanating from the ground."
