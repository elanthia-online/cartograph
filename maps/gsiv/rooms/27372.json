  "description": [
    "Stretching below a tall stone keep and its pennon-streaming turrets is the inner ward, host to numerous smaller structures built upon its sett stones.  To the south is a low stone kitchen, smoke rising from its many small chimneys, with a short stone-ringed stove outside its wall.  At the center of the courtyard sits a series of sett stone benches that ring a grand weeping willow, their masonry matching the steps of the keep's doors.  Beneath the tall curtain wall to the north is an open training yard."
