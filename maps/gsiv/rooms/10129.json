    "Fog rides across glassy black pools of water in wisps, enveloping nearly all the ground in a hazy blur.  A rotting log, its gnarled and dead roots exposed to the air, appears to be the source of the murk.  Trails of thick mist pour forth from a ragged hole in the log's bark.  A few sparse patches of moss grow at the base of the tree, their grey-green forms shrouded within the haze."
