    "The grey stone wall looks out over the ground below, where the whole of Lornon Avenue stretches out, spanning from the crimson arch of flames at one end to the gate at the west wall of Vornavis at the other.  The added advantage of being perched on a hill also offers a view of the bustling city.",
    "The grey stone wall looks out over the ground below, where the whole of Lornon Avenue stretches out, spanning from the crimson arch of flames at one end to the gate at the west wall of Vornavis at the other.  Flickers of light from the city beyond parallel the sky full of stars above."
