    "Textured black silk walls rise from a glossy black ebonwood floor.  Just above a wyvern painted ivory vase hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a high arched ceiling completes the picture.  An intricately carved ebonwood stand and a iron-bound ebonwood chest stand side by side in the middle of the room."
