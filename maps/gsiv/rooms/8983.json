  "description": [
    "The dark, maoral-paneled walls contrast sharply with the cream-colored plaster ceiling, which is molded with lacy filigree and delicate curves.  An antique sleigh bed fills the space beneath the round dormer window, its headboard curving gracefully like the prow of a ship.  Beside the door stands a carved wood valet draped with a silk brocade blanket."
