  "description": [
    "Phosphorescent moss grows profusely in streaks down the undulating stone walls and in saucer-shaped hollows along the rough cave floor, its pale glow almost making it appear as if the walls were melting.  The floor of the tunnel meanders downward to the northwest, where the darkness emits a faint scent of distant salt air."
