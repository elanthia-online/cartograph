    "The storage room is surprisingly quiet, though compared to the warehouse itself it would almost have to be.  A long wooden counter stretches across the entire length of the room, restricting public access to the main storage area.  At the end of the counter is a low, wide platform that is used to facilitate the loading and unloading of leathers and furs."
