    "An immense, seamless slab of polished amber and brown-speckled granite forms the primary horizontal work surface for this utilitarian room.  Buckets and palettes of paint in a rainbowed assortment are neatly labeled and set out for easy access.  A collection of glistening glass eyeballs stare up from the workbench beside a sign that reads, \"Wet Paint.\""
