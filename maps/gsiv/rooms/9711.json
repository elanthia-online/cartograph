    "The girth of the limbs underfoot is generous, providing a framework for passageways high above the forest floor.  They offer a safe promenade from tree to tree.  Birds sing among the black leaves robing the smaller branches, creating splashes of color against the dark foliage.  A break in the canopy offers a view of a stream meandering across the forest floor below.",
