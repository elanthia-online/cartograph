    "The silhouettes of four large pillars in the cavern's center tower up from drifting patches of low-lying fog like colossal sentinels guarding the chamber.  Occasional thumps find their way in, low and heavy in timbre, and muffled by distance.  These echo hollowly, bouncing from the stone walls as if they are panicked birds trapped inside a room."
