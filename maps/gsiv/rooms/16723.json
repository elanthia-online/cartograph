  "description": [
    "Wrapped securely around the base of a weathered a stone column is a thick rope leading downward, which disappears over the precipice edge and out of sight.  Directly opposite the column is the shattered remains of another, the pair of stone sentinels guarding the entrance to a broken bridge that ends abruptly after only a few feet.  Further ahead and in the ravine, a broken section of the stone bridge stands alone, reachable only by flying creatures or those who wish to attempt a dangerous leap."
