  "description": [
    "Canvas is pulled tightly between two trees, and beneath the shelter stands a long stone pedestal.  Indecipherable runes and designs etched into the structure are even harder to make out as the loganberry that covers the sides allows only glimpses here and there.  A smattering of golden aster stalks dot the landscape as far as the eye can see."
