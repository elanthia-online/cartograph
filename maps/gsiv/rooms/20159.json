    "The central focus of the room is a large silver-backed mirror held aloft by two gnome-sized dolls at the far rear end of the wagon.  Two intricately carved wardrobes take up the walls, one on each side, and their doors are flung open wide to allow any patrons to peruse the wares stored within.  You also see an oak carved wardrobe."
