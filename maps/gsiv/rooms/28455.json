    "Dark violet silk drapes over twin poles of ebonwood placed at either side of the area, giving the tent a spacious interior.  A pair of velvet-covered trays rest upon a beautifully carved table.  Displayed on a polished copper rack, a wide variety of colorful garments hang above a small wooden stand containing a variety of sandals.  Several glaes orbs hang from the supports, illuminating the shop with a warm glow."
