    "The Guild Office is an austere chamber, occupied by a massive oak desk and matching chair.  The only other furnishing is a large painting hanging opposite the door.  Though sparsely furnished, the office is paneled on all sides with polished wood, which radiates an opulent ambiance through its rich and glowing tones."
