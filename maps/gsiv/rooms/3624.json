    "The fel trees evident along the ridgeline have been cut down here, their stumps a quiet testament to their former stature.  Enormous piles of boulders are carelessly strewn about this section of the ridge.  Looking down into the valley, you realize that this is a perfect vantage point from which to launch an ambush."
