    "A few houses hide serenely in the woods.  Paths have been meticulously cleared through the snow to each doorstep.  In the yard outside one home, a snowman leans precariously, a lopsided grin on its face and totally oblivious to its impending fall.  No one stirs outside the homes, although the tracks of small feet throughout the snow suggest the recent passage of children, and the occasional muffled voice indicates that the homes are occupied.  One home in particular seems quite inviting."
