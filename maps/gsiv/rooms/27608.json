    "This cramped space is lit by a pair of oil lamps dangling from the rafters overhead, and the walls are lined with the parts and pieces of bows in various stages of completion.  On a toggled contraption mounted on the back wall, lengths of sinew and leather are stretched between wooden vise clips, and a rack beneath holds a collection of chisels, gouges, and mallets suited for wood carving."
