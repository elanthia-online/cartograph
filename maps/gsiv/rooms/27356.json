    "Folded paper flowers are tacked to the walls amidst an abstract mural of stationery scraps scribbled with handwriting samples.  A square, cobalt glass inkpot lies overturned on top of a long oaken table, the spilled ink staining the wood and dribbling on to the polished hardwood floor.  A thick-legged oak stool has been claimed by a black cat with a fluffy, white-tipped tail."
