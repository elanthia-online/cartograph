    "The light is low and intimate in the chamber, intruding through a window shadowed by the overhanging eves outside and a thick red drape within.  Across the walls, a fine pattern of fish scales has been painted with delicate color and a light touch.  A heavy mahogany bed sits in the corner, fitted with beige-colored linens and a bright green quilt."
