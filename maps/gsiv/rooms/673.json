    "Although thickly carpeted with grass, the trail is indented with two long dirt grooves, indicating that small wagons pass this way with some regularity.  An abandoned wooden wheelbarrow rests to one side of the trail, thoughtfully planted with multicolored peonies and snapdragons.  The night breeze wafts the flowers' fragrance gently through the air.",
