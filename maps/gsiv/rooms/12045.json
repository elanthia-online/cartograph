  "description": [
    "A narrow path leading between the edge of the river and a high wall to the south ends at the base of flight of granite stairs that rises up toward the top of the wall.  Spiky bulrush shoves its way between the broken slabs of the stone paving the surface of the path, working toward the wall with a relentless persistence that harbors no thought of failure."
