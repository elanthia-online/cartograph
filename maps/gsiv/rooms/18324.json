    "Lines of ivory foam cling to the edge of the shoreline, collecting against the soil and reflecting the muted light of the moons.  The trees framing the lagoon enhance the darkness of night as the branches of a few extend enough to cast shadows over the glistening black surface of the water.  Occupying the majority of the shore, a decorated bamboo hut appears to be closed for the evening, but the flickering light of torches illuminate a pathway leading around the lagoon."
