    "Lush moss grows beneath the tangled thorn bushes, nurtured by the cool wet mists.  The first several feet of each tree trunk is coated in the green velvet plant life, stained by constant exposure to moisture.  Smooth stones litter the ground, polished as if tumbled over and over by flowing water."
