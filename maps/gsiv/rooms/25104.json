    "A large iron door is swung open into the hallway outside the cell, while the cramped quarters beyond offer little comfort.  A light trickle of water fills the sunken floor of the cell, and a quiet sucking noise can be heard where the water exits on the far side.  A pair of skeletons lay face down in the shallow waters on the floor, their hands clasped even in death."
