  "description": [
    "This single-room hovel is filthy, and the nauseating smell makes it difficult for you to linger here.  Dirty straw is scattered over the packed earthen floor, and the thatched roof is rent by several large holes that allow the elements in to do their worst.  A few soiled hides that might have served as clothing are heaped in one corner.  The only items of any value here are contained in a locked wooden rack on the wall."
