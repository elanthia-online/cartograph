  "description": [
    "Plush leather seats and small side tables are arranged in a broad half circle on the edge of an expansive dance floor, positioned for a clear view of the trio of halflings playing music upon a raised platform at its far end.  A golden brocade curtain hangs on a stained oak wall to the west and flaps gently as the occasional breeze forces it aside, revealing a balcony beyond.  The shelves of a voluminous library are easily discerned through a narrow ebony archway to the north."
