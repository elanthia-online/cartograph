    "The high wooden wall that borders the road to the east is covered with sun-faded paintings of orcs and trolls, the caricatures grinning down on the shingled cottages that rest in its shade.  An aroma of apple pie wafts from an oven in a nearby cottage, and faint sounds of revelry can be heard from an inn somewhere beyond the wall."
