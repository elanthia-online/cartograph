    "Oak bookshelves cover two of the walls, filled with a variety of leather-bound tomes.  A pair of armchairs covered in saddle-tan leather sits before a generous window, taking advantage of the ambient light.  Antelope hides cloak the polished plank floor and a small fireplace claims the remaining wall."
