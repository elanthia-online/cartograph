  "description": [
    "Bright pink canvas walls soar high overhead, and rows of pink-dyed reed mats form walkways around the perimeter.  An elevated platform in the center of the room is filled with painted wooden cutouts of people and animals placed in a formation resembling a dance.  A pair of tall poles with a thick rope strung between them forms a narrow canopy over the top of the stage, each pole topped with a small platform from which a rope ladder hangs to the ground.  Just inside the flap, a simple wooden cart houses an assortment of goods for sale."
