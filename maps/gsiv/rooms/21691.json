  "description": [
    "The bottom floor of the tower is strewn with the rotting remnants of an ancient wooden desk and several chairs.  The rusted remains of a large weapons rack sag against one wall.  The air is so damp the moisture is palpable, and moss covers much of the cracked stone walls and rotting furniture.  A dilapidated archway leads back to the courtyard."
