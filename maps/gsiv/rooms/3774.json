    "The crest of the towering boulder affords a good view of the surrounding countryside.  To the north, you see the dense forests of the Lower Dragonsclaw.  Looking northeast, the verdant grasslands sprawl down towards the coast.  Gazing southward at the slopes, in the distance you see the snow-covered summits of the Dragonsclaw mountain range, shrouded in perpetual mist."
