    "The entire length of one wall has been turned into a baker's paradise, lined with numerous large brick stoves.  A broad table occupies the center of the kitchen while a short wooden rack sits near a wooden archway.  There rests a sturdy footstool next to a squat mahogany bookcase, and the strong scent of cinnamon hangs thick in the air."
