  "description": [
    "Around the circular rim of the oak table is a richly carved motif of musical notes, phrases and accents.  They intertwine, blending into a softer rendering of a night sky occupying the interior surface of the tabletop.  A crescent moon sits in the center with a halo of finely incised beams extending from it.  Chairs cluster around, featuring sculpted backs and deep red leather seats."
