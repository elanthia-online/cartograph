  "description": [
    "Baskets hang from the ceiling over numerous bins filled with bolts of dusty cloth, empty flour sacks, and broken jars.  The windows are thick with accumulated soot and dirt, the letters painted on the glass announcing a sale on tea leaves faded and peeling.  Along the back wall, a tall counter with stools at one end separates the front room from some small living quarters outfitted with a narrow cot and a metal footlocker."
