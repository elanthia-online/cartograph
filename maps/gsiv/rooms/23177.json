  "description": [
    "Dark shadows, created by the cliff above, lay across the tombstones and markers that line the simple, crushed seashell pathway as it winds its way through the cemetery.  Pale pink and white blossoms litter the ground, strewn haphazardly by the errant sea breezes which have tugged them free of the dogwoods that punctuate the four corners of the tiny lot."
