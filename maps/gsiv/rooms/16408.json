    "Amidst the crowded storefronts, a small niche of precious space has been reserved for a stone statue, its face turned to silver in the starlight.  The base of the carving is hidden amidst a riot of green leaves and large white roses, the foliage carefully manicured to not intrude on the cobblestone byway.",
