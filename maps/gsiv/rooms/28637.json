    "A thunderstorm rages disconcertingly close to this rooftop perch.  Peering through the battlements, the Sentoph mountains are visible, clouds obscuring the tops of their peaks.  Looking westward, you can make out the shape of a large castle set into a far mountainside, waiting at the end of a long trail.  A wide path winds between the battlements and a tall obsidian wall that follows the circle of the tower's curvature.  An enruned rolaren door serves as the only entrance into the high inner wall."
