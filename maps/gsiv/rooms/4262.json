    "The trail ambles below the boughs of the trees. Their age is evident in the substantial girth and height.  The underbrush is thick as well, making an excellent hiding place for the denizens of the forest to live out their lives unseen.  The hunting calls of the predators and the rustling of the leaves in the breeze fill the night air.",
