  "description": [
    "Stretching like splayed fingers into the ocean, the pier terminates in five floating docks edged in thin steel.  Wrought iron U-shaped clamps affixed to heavy chains keep the bobbing platforms from floating away, while dark green rope tethered to pilings provides a guideline that assists visitors in climbing to and from the lower structures.  A hemisphere of verdant paint with bright white letters scrolled on it claims that \"Slips 21-25\" can be found nearby."
