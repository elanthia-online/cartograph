    "Heavy scuff marks mar the flooring in the few spots that remain visible through the blanketing layers of sand and dirt.  An iron-banded shipping trunk sits just inside the doorway, nearly blocking egress to the rest of the space.  Across the room, a short circular table draped in mildewed canvas holds merchandise on display beneath a grimy window."
