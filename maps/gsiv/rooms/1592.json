    "High, stuccoed walls line either side of the brick paved street, providing privacy and security to the lush gardens and impressive manors that can be glimpsed beyond the bars of the finely wrought gates.  Here and there, precisely-trimmed conifers reach above the confining walls or adorn spacious balconies."
