    "Strange shingles of ice coat nearby rocks, protruding in fingers and giving the stones a hoary appearance reminiscent of great age.  Spruce and pines begin to crowd the boulders, growing more numerous as the trees march up the incline to the north.  The river to the south sounds more distant than it is, cloaked with the fog drifting up from its banks."
