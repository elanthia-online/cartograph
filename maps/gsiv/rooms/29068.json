  "description": [
    "Tucked away from the rest of the village, one dilapidated hut sits close to Widowmaker's Road, which passes to the south.  Sounds filter in from travelers on the road, making this a less than desirable spot for a homestead.  Some overgrown weeds have invaded the doorless entry of the simple mud and stick abode, and tracks of animals leading to and from the structure suggest it is not completely abandoned."
