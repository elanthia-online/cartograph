    "A narrow ribbon of moonlight forms a shimmering path down the center of what seems to be an ancient riverbed, the low ground covered by a carpet of ferns and wintergreen that thrive in the rich soil born of eons of fallen and rotting leaves.  Massive oaks and cedars stand to either side, their dark trunks standing like silent sentinels along the ancient path.",

Massive oaks and cedars stand to either side, inhabited by seemingly dozens of squirrels that scamper chittering along the branches."
