    "The imposing homes dotting the slopes of Nob Hill display the height of elven architecture, with imposing facades and sculpted gardens at their foot.  Fountains are plentiful, throwing water droplets into the air from a host of fanciful forms.  The cobblestone lane climbs to the south, rounding the hill as it goes."
