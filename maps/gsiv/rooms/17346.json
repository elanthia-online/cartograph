    "A shabby blue cloth stained with rings from tankards covers a heavy wooden table.  Rickety chairs are placed haphazardly around it with scuffed marks on their legs.  On the wall, a small anchor with barnacles still attached hangs precariously from a single hook.  Beneath it hangs a picture of a single seahorse resting on a coral reef."
