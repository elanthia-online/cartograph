    "[The Bread Basket, Herb Garden]"

  "description": [
    "The breeze stirring the night air is cool and carries the scent of fragrant kitchen herbs.  Pools of silver moonlight thread through the branches of the trees, and the filtered light makes patterns on the soft green grass.  A large gray rock is positioned by an oak door leading into the bakery.",
    "Delicate floral notes are carried on the cool breeze.  Billowy white tufts of dandelion weeds occasionally drift in the air around you.  An abundance of herbs and flowers are planted here, making the garden colorful and fragrant.  There is an inviting patch of soft green grass by the door to the shop.  A large gray rock with a bowl-like indentation on top sits in a patch of warm sunlight."
