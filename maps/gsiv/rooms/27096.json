  "description": [
    "Sunlight sparkles upon the surface of the water, drawing attention to the various hues that bleed together within the depths of the lagoon.  Hues ranging from almost translucent mist blue at the surface to dark midnight blue further down give the aqueous body depth and vibrancy.  The shoreline glistens with constant dew from the lapping water as it splashes against the soil."
