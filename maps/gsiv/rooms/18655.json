    "Surrounded by a circle of arctic flowers and plants placed lovingly in pots of sparkling blue crystal, a statue of a woman clad in robes of leaves stands to the northwest.  A blue-tinted glow filters down from high above, and the air swims with the scent of blooming flowers.  In front of the statue is a wooden altar, draped carefully with long, twining vines and delicate iceblossoms."
