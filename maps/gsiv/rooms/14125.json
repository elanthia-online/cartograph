    "The dense crowns of hawthorn trees back the area in variegated green-swept tones that contrast with the paler grasses blanketing the ground.  Twin brooks flow at opposite bends, pooling together in a shallow pond filled with tall spires of water chestnut.  A section of the bank is overgrown with velvety creeping mosses, offering a entreating alcove for reflection."
