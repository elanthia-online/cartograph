    "Numerous large footprints have been imprinted into the loose soil, their toes facing a variety of directions, as if this area has been trod upon with great frequency.  At least the size of giantkin tracks, the prints have been pressed into the dusty earth to some depth, as if their creator was a creature of large size and weight.  A foul-smelling odor, reminiscent of unwashed clothing and stale sweat, drifts through the air."
