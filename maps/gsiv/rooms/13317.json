  "description": [
    "A clearing opens between the scrub trees and thick water-loving grasses which crowd the lake's edge.  Rising up from the turf on the clearing's western edge is a bluff, its shoulders cloaked with willow, pine, oak and redbud trees.  A line of taller oaks stands on the ridge of the bluff like a dense crown, their foliage poking up from the drifting fog.  Across the water to the east, the spires of Castle Anwyn rise out of the mist."
