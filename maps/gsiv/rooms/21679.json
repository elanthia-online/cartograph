    "A crowd of onlookers stand on the outside of half-walled arena, watching as a number of people skate across a stretch of ice.  A long, bright red wooden stand is set up nearby, where a burly giantman stands behind, hawking his wares to people passing by.  The scent of baking bread wafts in from nearby."
