    "Though as verdant and overwhelmed by the growth of grasses and ferns as the rest of the valley, a raised plateau to the north does provide some means of visually pinpointing location.  A few large boulders litter the ground, perhaps washed down from the sloping sides of the tableland during harsh weather."
