    "A midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  A bronzed drake sculpture sits in one corner of a dark-stained oak floor.  There is an engraved copper bin on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
