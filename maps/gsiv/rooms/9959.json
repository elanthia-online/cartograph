    "Well-trodden paths lead off into the woods in several directions.  A strong whiff of animal dung is carried on the cool breeze that wafts through the dense forest, alternating with a faint smell of cooking meat.  Patches of ferns near the path are sparse in places, their coiled shoots broken off at the stem."
