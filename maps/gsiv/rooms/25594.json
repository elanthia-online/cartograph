    "The walls in this high chamber are painted pure white, but here and there they are scarred with burn marks, acid splotches and traces of powerful reagents and catalysts, as though some of the procedures undertaken did not turn out quite as expected.  The west wall is almost totally covered with a sprawling mural, a swirl of bright images.  A single titanium table stands in the middle of the room, heaped with scrolls and notebooks."
