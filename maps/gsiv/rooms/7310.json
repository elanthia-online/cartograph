  "description": [
    "Here the concave dirt walls have partially collasped.  Under the rubble, you see a half-buried corpse, one bony hand still holding a chipped mein dagger in a vise-like deathgrip.  You ponder what prizes may lie beneath the debris along with the unfortunate soul but the fresh earth atop the rubble pile makes you wary of lingering here too long."
