    "Protruding from the dark soil at odd angles, the shattered ruins of a cobblestoned courtyard rise like the exposed bones of civilization through the clover and wood violet groundcover.  Dank pools of peat moss form beyond a screen of red ferns, gnarled cypresses, and loosely tufted grasses that grow through and around the warped remains of wagons and stalls.  Ragged bits of fabric, half buried and ravaged by the elements, flutter from beneath the rooted structure of a leafy vine-covered arch."
