    "Fine fingers of ice creep across the arched dome of the chamber like threads of dark algae overcoming the impervious nature of the stone.  The chamber is dark, and somehow it seems obvious that it remains so at any time of day or season.  On the far wall, shadows almost hide an expanse of bas-relief statuary.  A disturbing sensation that the room is occupied brings the carving to notice, and imbues it with an undeniable presence."
