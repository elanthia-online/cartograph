    "[The Plaid Cloth]"

  "description": [
    "Swathes of tartan cloth lay draped across a large worktable that has been fitted into the northern wall, their vibrant lengths illuminated by brass lanterns.  Various mannequins stand guard beneath wall-mounted wooden shields decorated with the different symbols of the Giantkin clans.  Oak trunks rest back to back in the middle of the room, their lids flung open to display various pelt and hide garments.  A wicker basket holds hammered brooches near the tent's entry."
