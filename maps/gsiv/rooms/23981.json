    "The diamond-shaped oak table has been inlaid with tiny pieces of silvery hoarbeam and polished to a high sheen.  A set of high-backed chairs surrounds the table, the spindles intricately carved with tiny crowns.  Beautiful red rosebuds have been placed in a plain vase in the center of the table."
