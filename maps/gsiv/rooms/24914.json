    "Scattered fruits lay across a smattering of footprint paths that lead in several directions.  Petite amongst the taller trees, several star apple trees drape over the path, their branches the obvious culprit for the spilled fruit.  Crawling with scurrying red and black assassin bugs, one muddy path leads to an open-faced hut, while other paths wander off in other directions through green jungle."
