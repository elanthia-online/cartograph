  "description": [
    "Black volcanic rocks rise abruptly from the sea forming a wall against the furious tide.  To the east, malignant clouds blot the horizon in a roiling storm front.  Several fissures split the dark rock nearby, one looks as if it is dormant.  The largest spits an almost constant geyser of boiling steam and black ash."
