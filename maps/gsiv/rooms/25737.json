  "description": [
    "Matching crystal vases, each holding a dozen fragrant white lilies, adorn the side tables flanking the tall silk-draped four poster bed.  Banana plants and potted ferns, some as tall as an average man, lend a jungle lushness to the otherwise serene space.   Handknotted pale green carpeting with a musical motif covers much of the teakwood underfoot.  Floor to ceiling windows, left open to the cool evening breezes, provide moonlit views of the stepped terrace hillside overlooking the distant waterways."
