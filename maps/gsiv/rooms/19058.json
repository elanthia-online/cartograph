  "description": [
    "A couple of halfling sailors are kneeling on the deck, discussing the condition of the \"trunnels\" in their colorful burr.  This section of the main deck offers entrances into the deckhouse.  A delicious scent wafts out, indicating the presence of the galley inside.  Smoke curls from a black smokepipe extending out of the roof of the deckhouse galley."
