    "A narrow path loops through the thick jungle, its progress impeded by leaves as large as a halfling and trailing vines that hang down from above.  The heat hangs over the thick verdure like a curtain, so heavy it feels like it should be visible.  Visibility is limited to the area within a few feet about, however unseen insects raise a din in all directions."
