  "description": [
    "Several small buildings populate this area, and an ironwork fence stretches from the far end of the row to the other, creating one large front yard for the buildings.  Each has a path that leads from the door to a corresponding gate in the fence, and the area enclosed has been cultivated into a garden of raised planters full of snapdragons, tall stalks of foxglove, as well as other colorful blooms, while small, white flowers on low-growing creepers serve as ground cover."
