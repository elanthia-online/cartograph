    "Lengths of white canvas have been hung along the walls to hide the planks of the ship from view, which would allow visitors to forget they are onboard were it not for the slight swaying.  A wide trestle table has been set with a large steel tray that slides from side to side in a precarious manner.  The smell of fresh-baked pastries pervades the shop, as do over-excited halfling children."
