    "A pristine lake spreads out to the north, its sparkling waters providing a perfect backdrop to the silhouettes of the ancient black willows growing along its edges.  Stylized gates run in straight lines to the southwest, enclosing the gardens of the manor with intertwined patterns of wrought-iron.  The cobblestoned walkway stretches further west, and several eahnor-traced benches face the north, allowing one to comfortably enjoy the splendor of the lake."
