    "A tasteful rune staff display hangs on one of the red brocade walls, and an elegantly arched fel ceiling rises overhead.  A wyvern painted ivory vase sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a carved oak table on one side of the shop and an elegantly carved oak armoire on the other."
