  "description": [
    "The marsh abuts an escarpment so steep and geologically out of place it's as if the ground suddenly shifted up over a dozen feet.  Thick reeds and cattails grow directly up against the escarpment.  Sedge grass grows thickly on either side of the narrow, mucky path.  The air, uncomfortably still, is redolent with the rich organic smell of primordial ooze."
