    "The candles within the lanterns in this section of the wagon give off the faint aroma of cedar, and it mingles with the scent of leather in the air originating from the wares on display.  Against the side wall, a stately wardrobe stands with its doors propped open, and off to the left is a square pedestal table.  A wrought iron rack stands across the way on the opposite side of a carpeted runner that divides the space."
