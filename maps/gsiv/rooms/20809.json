    "Paintings of trees and flowers hang on the brightly painted walls, although some outlines of what look like animal hides still show through the new paint.  A mountain snowcat hide rests in a place of honor by a stone fireplace and a huge weapon rack hangs on the wall above.  A small altar with the symbol of V'tull painted on it is one corner, and in another rests a giant four-poster bed complete with royal blue drapery.  A haon dresser sits beside the bed holding small items."
