    "A framed Ta'Illistim map hangs on one of the painted emerald green walls, and a sturdy white cedar ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of a cream-colored ceramic tile floor.  There is a long mahogany rack on one side of the shop and a wide faenor-trimmed table on the other.",
    "Enclosed by painted emerald green walls, the shop features a grey-veined white marble fountain in the center of its ceramic tile floor.  A framed Ta'Illistim map hangs under the white cedar ceiling.  Right near the front is a wide faenor-trimmed table and a long mahogany rack."
