    "Light pours in through a domed stained glaes ceiling depicting Solhaven Bay, and shines brightly on a varnished dark oak floor. Built into refined oak-paneled walls are a series of vine-carved oak shelves, which hold various dust-covered wares.  A glass-fronted black witchwood bookcase stands alongisde a heavy black ebonwood desk inlaid with tendrils of rolaren grapevines.  A conjoined rings framed painting seems to watch over the room.",
