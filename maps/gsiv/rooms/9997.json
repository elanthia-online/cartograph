    "A twenty-foot-high mound of earth blocks passage to the west, its steep borders slick with mud as if it had been washed down into the grotto by centuries of rain and drainage.  Thick patches of weeds grow in profusion around the dirt, but the bare ravine floor to the east is stony and desolate."
