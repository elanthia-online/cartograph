  "description": [
    "The tunnel stretches on, the sharp incline coming to a stop here.  A chill hangs in the air like a fog, and pale shifting blue light filters in from the north.  The ripples play along the walls in gentle patterns, softly flickering in and out of sight from time to time.  Seashells of many varieties line the path here, each lovingly polished to a lustrous shine."
