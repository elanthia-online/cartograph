    "Fluttering streamers of brightly colored blue and white paper are wrapped around the stalks of corn here in fanciful spiral designs that only wrap around the stalk up to waist height.  Apparently, someone has also actually taken the time out of their day to braid the yellow silk tufting from the ears of corn.  The braiding also stops at around waist height."
