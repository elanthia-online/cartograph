    "The surrounding area seems strangely quiet for such a cool and pleasant upland region as this.  You wonder where the wildlife could have gone.  Looking around, you notice something startling and disconcerting.  Beneath a low-growing shrub beside the path are several carcasses of small animals and birds.  They seem to be recently deceased."
