  "description": [
    "The remains of a small grass-roofed, daub and wattle hut are nearly hidden by the dense jungle undergrowth.  The dilapidated state of the hut's roof is evidence that it has been abandoned for some time.  A crude sketch of a bird in flight has been painted on the side of the hut in some sort of maroon paste.  The doorway has collapsed, becoming nothing more than a frame for a white cluster of spider webs."
