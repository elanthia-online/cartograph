    "The walls of this guest room are painted a cheery yellow and there is a light scent of cinnamon in the air.  A small window is cracked open just a bit, and the yellow silken curtains billow in the refreshing breeze.  A low bed with an elegantly engraved headboard lies against one wall next to a small wooden shelf."
