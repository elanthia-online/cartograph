  "description": [
    "Clearly His Majesty spends a great deal of time here when he isn't hiding from adventurers.  The decor is certainly the best that generations of kobold artists have produced, the centerpiece consisting of a dented helm balanced on a stick so that it rattles a bit if you tap it.  There are other equally fine treasures here, no doubt taken as spoils from the king's many victories and each almost as marvelous as the last."
