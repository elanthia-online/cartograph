    "The slope of the lawn creates a natural depression around the bailey gate, where a broad circle of paving stones is bordered by some square-trimmed boxwood bushes.  The cobblestone path divides the lush, green lawn, heading north toward a thick copse of trees and southwest to the stable grounds."
