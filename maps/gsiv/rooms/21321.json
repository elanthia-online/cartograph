    "[House Brigatta, Banyan Tree]"

  "description": [
    "It is noticeably cooler here than in the other parts of the garden.  A huge banyan tree keeps this area in a perpetual gloom.  There are various mosses clinging to the tree, and all the shrubs seem stunted.  A gardener's shed, almost hidden under a dense netting of moss and flowering vines, is nestled close to the western boundary of the garden.  Running along the side of the house is a spiral staircase leading up to the rooftop observatory, while the back porch of House Brigatta can be seen to the south.",
