    "Dim light invades the mist-shrouded landscape, its source, several shuttered windows high up the dark face of the black shale cliff.  Sharp angles and severe lines lend depth to the imposing shadows that surround a carved stone tavern that is carved into the very mountainside.  The uneven pathway is slick with plant life that is partially hidden in the murk of the night."
