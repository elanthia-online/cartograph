    "A group of matronly elves share a quiet cup of tea at a small table set in the communal back yard alongside the var.  Chatting over their day's labor, the ladies grumble about their husbands' uncanny ability to disappear whenever domestic work needs to be done.  Golden light streams through the cottage windows, as clean now as the day they were made.",
    "On either side of the var, rugs and other home furnishings are piled outside the cottage doors as a group of neighbors join together in a cleaning party.  Through the open windows of one small cottage, you see a veritable army of matronly elves armed with feather dusters and mops, gossiping animatedly as they clean.  In the darkened corner where the var takes a sharp turn, two elderly gentlemen lean against the wall, staying well out of the way of the work.",
    "Set within a cluster of thorny rose-bushes, a carved marble panel is hollowed out within a small niche.  The var continues past the shrine, curving with the backs of several large buildings."
