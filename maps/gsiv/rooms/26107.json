    "Arranged beneath a thick sheet of clear glaes covering the table are concentric rings of feathers, each a different shade of blue.  From the iridescent and rounded bull's-eye of a peacock to the slender taper of a bluejay, each wispy circle honors a different bird.  A blue-glazed vase etched with wings rests at the center and is filled with delicate hydrangea blooms.  Teal raw silk covers the seat of each chair, as does a matching neck rest at the top of the chairback."
