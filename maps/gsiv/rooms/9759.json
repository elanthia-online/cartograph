  "description": [
    "The platform widens into something of a landing, offering a vantage point from which to view the suspended stairway overhead.  Each ebony step and its riser are connected to its own guide wires, which are so fine, they are almost invisible in the gloom.  A matched pair of arched handrails hangs over the collection of steps, supported independently of any other part of the construction.  On the wall of the landing, a tapestry covers the wood, its colors and workmanship every bit as amazing as the stair."
