    "This section of the cavern narrows to a point, though the walls that meet it are rounded and mostly smooth, perhaps evidence of excavation by hand.  Several stacks of wood occupy one area beside a small bonfire, providing a bit of warmth to ward off the occasional chilly breeze that intrudes upon the space."
