  "description": [
    "A narrow cave stream trickles lanquidly across the stone floor.  Roots from unseen flora outside the tunnel have breeched the walls and formed a stable root mat that floats upon the water.  The occasional *pop* of bubbles on the surface reveal the location of hidden amphibians below.  The stifling heat and humidity do little to encourage visitors to linger."
