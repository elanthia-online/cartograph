    "Intricate scrollwork adorns a large teakwood table placed in the center of this tiny cabin.  An unfinished shelf lines one wall at eye level to the average sized halfling.  Wood chips and shavings litter the floor, while an unused broom is propped against one wall.  A carved wooden sign is the only decoration."
