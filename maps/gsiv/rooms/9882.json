  "description": [
    "High above the door of this hollowed out room, a large crack in the mountainside lets in thin streams of sunlight.  Over the years, it has also let in snow which has melted and frozen many times to form a line of ice stalagmites under it.  The grey light falls on a huge nest built from a collection of whole trees and bushes as well as bits of collected matter like clothing and boots.  A leaning altar is almost completely buried in one of the stalagmites."
