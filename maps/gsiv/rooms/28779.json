  "description": [
    "Set off from the bustle of the kitchen, the pantry is a doorless chamber that is lined, floor-to-ceiling, with foodstuffs, with only a break for a sliding wooden panel in the southern wall.  Several barrels of pickled fish lend a salty, pungent aroma to the room that is not precisely unpleasant.  Nearby, a salted rolton carcass hangs from the ceiling beams, swaying slowly on creaking hanging lines.  Despite the proponderance of stored food, everything looks fresh or pristinely preserved."
