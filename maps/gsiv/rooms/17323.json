    "Plush blue carpet softly cushions footsteps in the room.  A king-sized bed, placed near a door, awaits an occupant.  A light blue comforter is folded neatly at the foot of the bed.  Small night tables flank the bed, a vase with a single blue rose on each.  A pair of brass and glass lanterns flank the bed, holding back the night darkness.  Set upon a slightly raised tile platform is a large marble tub.  A long lead-glass window runs the length of one wall along the ceiling.",
