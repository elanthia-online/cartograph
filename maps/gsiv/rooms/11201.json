    "This branch is about as high as you can go, since the next one appears to be about 8 feet over your head.  It's not a particularly comfortable spot, as the branch you're standing on is only about 2 feet thick.  Far above, you can see an armored skeleton impaled on a broken branch.  It's hard to imagine how it got up there, much less managed to impale itself horizontally on the branch."
