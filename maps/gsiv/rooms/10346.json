    "A pathway of yellowish grey alabaster winds its way along the edge of the river, its gently curving borders outlined with blooming vegetation.  Flowers of many varieties, their petals shining in brilliant shades of yellow, pink, and pale blue, line the walkway. A sweet perfume rising above their outstretched leaves.",
