    "A ruby-eyed grinning skull hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls, and an ebonwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  An open-mawed greater vruul statue sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on one side of the shop and a glass-topped mistwood counter on the other."
