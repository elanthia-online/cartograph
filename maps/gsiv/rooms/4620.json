    "Devoid of living plants, the \"garden\" is a desolate volcanic wasteland.  Large boulders of glaes-striated tufa sit half-buried in cinders, cracks gaping here and there in the various stones.  Sculpted bronze demonic limbs protrude from the larger crevices, while a large, bronze statue stands crouched in the garden's center."
