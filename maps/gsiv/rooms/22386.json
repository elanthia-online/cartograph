    "A blanket of thick grass stretches outward, cradling the multitude of blooms nestled deeply within the rich soil.  Mist dances among the trunks of tall expansive trees, and the branches rustle with the movement of the natural inhabitants of this garden.  Tucked to the outskirts, a few moss-laden benches provide seating for visitors.  A narrow cobblestone walkway leads north and out of the garden, while a natural trail ventures further within."
