    "Large flat stones are arranged along the perimeter of the beach, their smooth surfaces wide enough for easy reclining.  Rising and falling with the tide, the surf tumbles gently across the glittering sands and creates damp lines along the shore.  Bamboo torches are spread throughout the area, their brightly burning tops dispelling the dark of the night, while an enormous bonfire burns fitfully at the center of the clearing."
