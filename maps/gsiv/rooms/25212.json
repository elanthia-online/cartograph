  "description": [
    "The tunnel splits off into a myriad of different winding corridors here, each appearing no different from the other.  There are wide, straight marks in the dusty floor leading off into a few of the twisting passageways.  Dark splotches accompany the trailing marks, nearly concealed by the color of the dirt they stain."
