  "description": [
    "Devoted to masculine pleasures, this dimly lit room is paneled in mellow cedar -- the scent of the wood mingles pleasantly with that of fine pipe tobacco.  The floor is cushioned by a patterned sisal rug, and a large library table surrounded by comfortable leather chairs provides room for a game of cards or for a pipe to be carefully packed.  Flanked by potted palms, an antique ship's bar stands against the far wall."
