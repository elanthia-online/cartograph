    "Abutted against the town wall, the roof of the barracks is at the perfect height to peer over the top of the palisade down to the western road and the forests beyond.  The sparkle of sunlight glints off the bay to the northwest, and the combined scents of salt and loam permeate the surrounding air.  A rough teak trapdoor leads back down into the barracks."
