    "A young half-elven maid unhurriedly folds clothes on a neatly-made bed in the corner.  Three other beds occupy the other corners, each with its own small dresser nearby.  A tiny, round window on the west wall allows a bit of sunlight into the room.",
    "Four beds occupy the corners of this small room, each with its own small dresser nearby.  Three are neatly made and empty, their owners presumably busy keeping the guild in order.  A small mound and faint snoring indicate the last to be occupied.  A tiny, round window on the west wall allows a bit of moonlight into the room."
