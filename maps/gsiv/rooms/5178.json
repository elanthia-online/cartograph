    "The source of the waterfalls to the west, a large, fresh water lagoon, lies to the east, contained by the cliff face.  Colorful birds dart in and out of the large bushes and ferns that surround the narrow beach of the lagoon.  To the west, some rickety stairs lead down the cliff face to the beach."
