    "Spherical glass lanterns are strung from the domed ceiling of the tent, lending a warm glow to the chilly room.  A frosted glass case sits in the center of the room, the base of it covered in a thin layer of dust from the dirt floor.  Off to one side is a many-armed coat rack.  A low humming noise can be heard coming from a tent flap."
