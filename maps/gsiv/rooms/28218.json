    "Thick, lush rugs of Vornavian silk cover the ground, providing a firm yet comfortable footing.  A long linden table lines one wall of the tent, its top covered with refreshments.  The opposite side of the tent is covered by a large leather couch, while a pile of soft velvet cushions covers the corner in-between."
