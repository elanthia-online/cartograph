    "Beneath a crimson sky, a lush jungle extends as far the eye can see with vibrant, deep cerulean foliage.  Skeletal parrots watch the movement below from atop their leafy perches, especially the struggle of some poor unfortunate creature being devoured by a carnivorous pink and yellow flower.  A raging green waterfall tumbles off a steep cliff nearby, the viridian water teeming with bony fish.  A pair of glowing eyes peer out of a hollow tree stump.  The bizarrely picturesque area is disturbingly absent in all other sensation."
