  "description": [
    "Deep, short steps rise up from the nave toward the temple's chancel, curling away from an obscenely feminine statue of bronze.  Urns of pale jade are spaced along the outer steps, holding sirenflower, lavender, and lilac.  The plants are overgrown and seem almost too healthy, the green of their stems so vivid as to be unnatural."
