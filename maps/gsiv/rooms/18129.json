    "In sharp contrast to the entry chamber, this cubicle is both uniform in dimension and serene in atmosphere.  Sand-colored walls stretch upward to a glass-paned vaulted ceiling that funnels moonlight directly onto the wrought iron workbench below.  Aside from a few assorted pieces of alchemical equipment, the room's only distinguishing feature is a vividly painted mural depicting a grisly scene in larger-than-life proportions.",
