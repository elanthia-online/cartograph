  "description": [
    "Curving towards the southeast, the river begins to narrow as the clusters of various water plants force the water to slow and inhibit its path.  Riverside palm trees sway lightly in the night breeze as they cling to the watery banks, shafts of moonlight gracing their forms and glittering on the surface of the river.  The distant melody of ocean waves provides a backdrop to the sounds of nocturnal creatures echoing throughout the shadow-encased jungle."
