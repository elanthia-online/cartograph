    "Low hanging vines, their sharp needles threatening harm to any who approach, drape downward to engulf the tops of some low, spindly shrubs.  Partially consumed by the voracious vines, a simple mud-walled hut cowers amid the encroaching greenery.  A large, fallen bird's nest lays broken on the ground, bits of shattered eggshells and a few tiny feathers stuck between the twigs and grass around them."
