    "Here, a short ridge forms the summit of Olbin Pass.  Winds gust through the area, funneled in between the sharp, rocky crags to the east and west.  Jutting from their rugged slopes, flat outcroppings are piled high with heavy drifts of snow, clashing with the dark uncovered rock of the steeps and drop-offs."
