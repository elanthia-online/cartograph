  "description": [
    "The intricate marquetry of wood from the foyer continues in the spacious lobby, including a narrow pattern of lilies created from white ash set into dark maple that wraps around the walls of the circular room.  Five wood-framed arches lead off from the room to separate patios, allowing a slight breeze to flow through the room carrying with it the scent of honeysuckle.  In the center of the room rests a cushioned bench wrapped around a dark wood pedestal."
