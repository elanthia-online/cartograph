    "The trail is clotted with tall weeds and clumps of thistle.  Scattered among the stumpy olive trees are a few thin haon and mahogany trees.  Green with mold and lichen, the trees lean over the trail at strange angles.  A few dead and dying vines hang from the gnarled and twisted branches of the trees."
