    "A single porthole, crusted with salt and lime scale on the outside, allows a bit of weak sunlight to filter into this cramped space.  An overstuffed blue and yellow sofa is pushed against the far wall, and a large spread of refreshments covers the top of a peeling white table.  Odd assortments of feathers, ribbons, and dried flowers hang from the low ceiling."
