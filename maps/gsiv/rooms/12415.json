  "description": [
    "Squeezing past a collapsed archway, you gaze upon an immense oak table stretching the length of the room.  Ornately carved dragons form the table legs, their claws giving the illusion of melding into the floor.  Eerily, the table is still highly polished and unscathed by the destruction around it, as if nary a flame had licked upon it.  You can't help but wonder why the impoverished residents of the area never carted it off."
