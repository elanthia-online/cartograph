  "description": [
    "An enormous bronze medallion bearing a rugged boot in low relief has been inlaid into the grey stone floor of the building's foyer, greeting prospective patrons to the facilities.  Hallways branch off in three directions, the darkened corridors lit by luminescent toadstools of similar size and coloration.  The scent of leatherworking emanates strongly from the north."
