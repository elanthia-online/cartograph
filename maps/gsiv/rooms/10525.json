  "description": [
    "Dense thickets of swamp roses border the bayou, and a thick covering of pale green duckweed covers the surface of the water.  A lush blanket of decumbent shrubbery covers the standing water as well as the ground in this section of the swamp.  Whorls of pointed oval leaves sprinkled with white flowers and bright red berries along the stems of the shrubs are barely noticeable under the starless night sky.",
