    "Coarse walls of stucco encircle the office, the irregular surface covered with a bright blue paint that almost completely obscures the off-white color underneath.  Lanterns hang from the exposed rafters of the ceiling and provide ample illumination for an enormous iron and wood desk that occupies the center of the space.  A simple linen flag is nailed to the wall near the exiting archway."
