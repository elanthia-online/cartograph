  "description": [
    "A tall mithril gate marks the threshold of a lush, verdant courtyard surrounded by a stately flagstone wall.  Moss, lichens, and lacy green fronds drape over the wall in a gentle welcome into a serene oasis shielded from the bustle of town.  A vine-covered alcove surrounds a marble statue.  Stone pavers traverse through the lawn and spiral around a beautiful marble fountain in the center of the luxuriant grounds.  The path continues toward an expansive grey stone manor, shadowed by the branches of an old knotted oak tree."
