    "The trail winds among the trees.  From behind a gap in the thick yew hedge to the southwest comes the clanging of hammers on anvils and the sizzle of hot metals.  The smell of burning charcoal competes with the pleasant odor of fresh sawdust.  To the north is a grove of gnarled olive trees.  Southeast, the path leads to a wide clearing."
