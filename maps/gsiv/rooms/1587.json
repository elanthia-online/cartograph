    "The high gabled roof and inmistakable odor would mark the stable east of the intersection as the South 'Haven Mews, even if the sign above the open doorway did not.  Dark stains and the crescent scoring from shod hooves have marred the surface of Salters' Road, and whinnying and neighs can be heard from the stable's dark interior.  Salters' Road ends just to the south, where the wooden platform ends and the close-built structures of a past era close in, leaving only an alleyway to the south."
