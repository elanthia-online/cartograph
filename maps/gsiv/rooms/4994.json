  "description": [
    "The trail wanders over a rise in the forest floor, passing through a stand of white birches than bend over the leaf-carpeted path from both sides.  The hillside slopes gently down to the southeast, and the faint sound of a gurgling spring somewhere in the distance can be heard during lulls in the forest breeze."
