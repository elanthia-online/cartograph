    "The sound of distant waves carries in from the east and south.  The moors, a tapestry of mottled greens and sedgy browns, stretch off in all other directions.  An eerie mist rises over the trail leading down into the moors.  In the center of the trail is a weathered post with a dead gore crow nailed to it."
