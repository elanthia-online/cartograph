    "Thick oak poles stand in each corner of the tent, holding the oilcloth canopy up overhead.  A round marble pedestal sits off in one corner of the tent, while a large mahogany map table occupies much of the central floor space.  An oilcloth flap hangs across the rear of the tent, concealing the back portion of the structure."
