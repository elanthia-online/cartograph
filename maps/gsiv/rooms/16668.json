    "The passage ends abruptly here in a ramshackle wall of old boards and planks.  The odor of mildew is almost overpowering, assaulting your nostrils like a wild animal.  A thin layer of slime covers most of the walls and floor, providing an ideal breeding space for all variety of worms and slugs."
