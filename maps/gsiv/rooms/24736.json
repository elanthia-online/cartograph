    "A masterfully woven tapestry of barbed vines extends between two oak sentinels like viridian latticework, where countless small woodland animals have been ensnared in their prickly embrace.  Small, razor-sharp thorns cradle each creature in an organic iron maiden, while blood slowly oozes from the tiny corpses and coats a network of gnarled roots below."
