  "description": [
    "Cool blue stucco decorates the walls of the room above the tongue-in-groove wainscoting that is painted serene white.  Twin glassless windows, framed in sheer gauze, provide an excellent view of the sunlit garden while the opposing wall supports a black oak door.  A painted silk privacy screen is arranged in one corner and offers the occupants a discreet place to disrobe or freshen up.  Positioned beneath gauzy mosquito netting, a four-poster black oak bed covered with soft white linens is flanked on the right by a tall black oak table, while at its foot rests a decorative black oak cassone."
