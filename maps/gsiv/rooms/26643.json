    "Windows and columns carved directly into the far wall offer a stunning view of the waters below from the high vantage point within the plateau.  A number of benches, carved directly into the stone walls, line the outer edge of the room, each positioned between a pair of columns to provide a small seating nook.  Tiled with silvery mithril, a small platform is the main adornment in the center of the chamber."
