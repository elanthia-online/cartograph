    "From here the more permanent buildings lie to the south, close under the city wall.  To the west huddle the semi-permanent canvas-and-timber tents where the caravan hands bunk during their brief stays.  To the northwest the beast pens line the inside of the caravansary's north wall.  The caravansary entrance lies to the east."
