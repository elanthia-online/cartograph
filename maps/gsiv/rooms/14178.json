  "description": [
    "Shimmering light from brass sconces mounted at intervals around the room bathe an ornately carved dais of Liabo marble in a warm glow.  The walls are hung with purple cloth trimmed with gold emblems bearing the seal of Lorminstra.  A sweet, pungent aroma pervades the room from a pair of golden braziers burning to either side of the altar."
