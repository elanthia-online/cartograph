    "Grey marble floors are cool underfoot, and the room is illuminated by a large silvery vultite fixture hanging from the ceiling.  Against the far wall, a trio of small steps leads to a nondescript clear glaes altar.  A pair of crossed white ora broadswords hangs above a resplendent golden tapestry, directly opposite a pair of crossed black ora broadswords hanging above a majestic shadowed tapestry.  A silver mithril sign is affixed to the wall above a simple white table."
