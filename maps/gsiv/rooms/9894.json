    "Broken shards of a few massive, discolored eggshells are strewn on the floor of the nest, which is as large as a good-sized wagon.  Bird droppings that would each fill a bucket festoon the edges of the nest, dripping from the jagged sticks and thatches of grass in various states of desiccation."
