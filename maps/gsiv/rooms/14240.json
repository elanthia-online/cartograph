    "Large silk cushions in alternating shades of white and yellow are spaced evenly across the marble floor.  Overhead, the illuminated ceiling depicts the sinuous body of a golden drake, yearning jaws striving for its own tail.  Between a pair of marble pillars supporting a banistered balcony, a patterned velvet carpet proceeds toward an ora-bound honey oak door."
