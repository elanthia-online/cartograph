    "Slender winnet and barabok trees edge the clearing, their wiry trunks twisting and twining in an impenetrable lattice of dark and sandy woods.  Leaf-clustered branches spread overhead in a lushly-woven canopy of shifting greens and browns, casting your surroundings in a kaleidoscope of shadow and pale light.  A knobby pebble path emerges from a gap in the trees to your east, stretching between sunken beds of flowering herbs, and dwindling to an end at the doorstep of a small wooden cottage.",
