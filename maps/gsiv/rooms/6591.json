    "Walking into this room is like walking into winter.  A gripping cold that defies explanation holds the chamber in its fist.  Wooden bunks stand in rows along the walls, almost all of them in one piece -- surprising with so much wreckage to be found in other parts of this old fortification. Some strange characters have been painted over the doorframe with a red-tinted pigment."
