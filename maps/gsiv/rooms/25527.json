    "[The Firebird, Bowsprit]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A massive phoenix, wrought of fireleaf and plated with red brass and gold, spreads its wings beneath the bowsprit, screeching silent defiance at the skies.  Every feather is picked out in sheets of metal thinner than parchment.  Eyes of amber glare in the daylight, but their shine pales in comparison to the brilliance of a thousand and more glimaerstones set into the metallic plumage.  The gems collect the sun's fire and roil with greater radiance, wreathing the bird's form in flickering points of flame."
