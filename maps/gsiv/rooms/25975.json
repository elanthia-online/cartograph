    "Moonlight from the open windows set high above filters down to the soft emerald-hued rug that covers the stone floor with its luxuriously plush surface.  A long, rose-carved table wraps around three walls of the room, its surface laden with various jars.  Strong scents waft into the air, but a gentle breeze from above keeps the fragrance from becoming overpowering."
