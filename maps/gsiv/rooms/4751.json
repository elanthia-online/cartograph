  "description": [
    "Fur-like moss and clinging lichen have engulfed the few remaining cobblestones, obscuring their presence from all but the keenest observation.  A chill mountain wind gusts through the ancient oaks, rattling their dry leaves and sending a whisper through the dark woods.  Nearby the stone-grey trunk of a massive oak contrasts with the dark natural bark of its peers."
