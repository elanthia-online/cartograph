  "description": [
    "Overgrown brush leaves only a narrow footpath upon which to travel.  To the north, a wall of tangled briars, several feet thick, blocks further passage, although breaks in the branching briars allow a view of Kraken's Fall and its surroundings.  Vines creeping along the boggy ground seem determined to trip any who relax their vigilance as they pass.  Clusters of wildflowers lend an incongruent cheeriness to the otherwise dreary environs."
