    "Placed in the front yard of a quaint, loganberry-covered cabin, a three-wheeled wagon serves as a planter and has orderly rows of moonflowers.  Needle-shaped leaves from the surrounding pine trees blanket the ground.  Tall and wide, a haystack with a huge gap through its middle stands at the side of the small structure."
