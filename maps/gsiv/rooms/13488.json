    "The fragrance of brewed coffee and tea wafts through the air of the cafe, the aroma of floral accents mix quite pleasantly with the rich, bitter scents.  A long mahogany counter stretches along the western wall, its surface covered with various brewing contraptions.  The off-white sandstone tile extends across the floor, giving the room a more spacious feel."
