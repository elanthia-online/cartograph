  "description": [
    "Ethereal light surrounds a steel door leading into the royal court.  The thick, gold-edged crimson carpet continues down the hall shadowed by structural wooden beams overhead.  Elegantly carved gold banisters rise and fall along the walls in a wave-like motion.  A pair of carved wooden mantles hold a collection of paintings on either side of the door."
