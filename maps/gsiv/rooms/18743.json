    "Carved from the soft sandstone by an eddy in an ancient underground river, this alcove has been adapted for use as an office.  The sparse but luxurious fittings look out of place among the unfinished rock; the exquisite parquetry desk of mahogany and ivory could be in a museum or palace, as could the hand-knotted tufted silk carpet on which it sits."
