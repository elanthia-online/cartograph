    "A path has been created by those passing to and fro, through the tall grasses and wildflowers, to a heavy-limbed pear tree sitting in the distance.  Beneath the tree's limbs, a few fireflies dart through the air, leaving bright trails before they disappear again into the leaves.  Flattened and broken around the base of the trunk, the grass is a cushioned seat which is silvered by the moonlight that strikes the backs of the green blades.",
    "A path has been created by those passing to and fro, through the tall grasses and wildflowers, to a heavy-limbed pear tree sitting in the distance.  Beneath the tree's limbs, a small area of shade is created, offering shelter from the bright sun above.  Flattened and broken around the base of the trunk, the grass is a cushioned seat, which has been recently utilized if the open book left behind is any indication."
