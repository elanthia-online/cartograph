  "description": [
    "You pause to take a deep breath and look at the beauty of the land around you.  A sea of mountain peaks fills your vision, rising and falling like storm waves tossed about in a titanic gale, but silent and unmoving.  The precarious path hugs the ridgeline closely.",
    "A sea of mountain peaks fill the view from this ridge.  The mist-shrouded peaks glow in the moonlight, while the valleys below are lost in the deep darkness.  The treacherous path follows the ridgeline closely."
