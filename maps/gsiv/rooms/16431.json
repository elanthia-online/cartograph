    "Polished alabaster descends from the winding stairs at this corner of the corridor and mimics the frothy flow of waves spilling forth upon the smooth teak flooring.  Decorative mother-of-pearl balusters are evenly spaced to match each of the wave-shaped steps as they ascend to the landing above, while near at hand they culminate in a pair of banisters fashioned into the semblance of fishermen casting their nets."
