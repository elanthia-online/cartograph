    "A light dusting of flour covers the floor where a bag has burst from being knocked off of a shelf.  A slight lad busily cleans up the mess, sweeping the white powder into a dustpan and from there into a trash bin.  A young mother, making one heck of a ruckus, is angrily chastizing a tearful child while she searches for the silvers required to pay for the wasted victual."
