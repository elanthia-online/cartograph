    "Interleaved brass and copper ornamentation gleams from the edges of an arched niche along the western wall.  Nearby, the smooth facade of pale sandstone is marred by a crusted brown stain, as if something has slid down the wall into a heap, but the source of the blotch is nowhere to be seen.  A faint iron tang clings to the air."
