  "description": [
    "A horseshoe-shaped lagoon of brilliant emerald green water is bordered by a stunning white sand beach.  Dense jungle growth surrounds the lagoon on all sides.  The chatter and trill of unseen creatures comes from somewhere deep in the jungle.  Sunlight reflects off the surface of the still lagoon, causing a myriad of sparkles."
