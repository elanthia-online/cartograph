    "Latticed walls of supple birch encompass the circular dwelling, wide diamonds of rough spun canvas visible through the narrow wooden bands.  Underfoot, several richly detailed, plush rugs line the unfinished pine floor that fills the expanse.  Situated on opposite sides along the perimeter of the circle, an oversized oak chest and a weathered maple trunk overflow with goods."
