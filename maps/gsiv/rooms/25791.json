  "description": [
    "Red stucco meets white wainscoting to create a warm and bright kitchen that is illuminated by the golden sunlight that spills through the glassless windows.  Standing on opposite sides of the room, an open black oak door leads to a small garden, while an open whitewashed door provides access to the villa's guestroom.  Positioned beneath an enormous lantern, a large cherrywood table topped with bowls and platters is surrounded by long wooden benches and small cherrywood chairs."
