    "A pleasant little park area has been constructed on the roof of the inn, high above the bustling city streets.  A shallow, curbed planter in the center of the park is home to a thick, green lawn and a pleasant foresty odor rises from the dwarf pine trees growing in grey-blue granite planters spaced along its edge.  Two benches have been positioned to look out over the low greystone wall to the south, offering a lovely view of the sapphire-tiled roof of the bank and the rest of the city beyond.",
    "A pleasant little park area has been constructed on the roof of the inn, high above the moonlit streets.  A shallow, curbed planter in the center of the park is home to a dew-covered lawn and a pleasant foresty odor rises from the dwarf pine trees growing in dark granite planters spaced along its edge.  Two benches have been positioned to look out over the greystone wall to the south, offering a view of the sapphire-tiled roof of the bank, which glows softly in the silvery starlight."
