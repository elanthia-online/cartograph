    "Blue watered silk walls rise from a glossy black ebonwood floor.  Just above a white vanilla orchid-filled vase hangs a detailed landscape painting, and a high arched ceiling completes the picture.  An intricately carved ebonwood stand and a heavy lead glass display case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
