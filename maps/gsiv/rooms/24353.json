    "A long metal table is the only piece of furniture in this sparsely decorated room.  A sharp and rusty lever has been mounted to its side.  Situated low on one wall is a dented metal hatch, the floor surrounding it dusty with iron shavings.  A large brass-framed painting hangs just above the hatch."
