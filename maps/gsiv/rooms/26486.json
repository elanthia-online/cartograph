    "Tendrils of chilly mist slip through the area and twine their way about the colonies of staghorn coral that stretch from varying heights in the shale wall and cast long shadows upon the pathway.  Dim lights attempt to part the gloom as they slip free of windows carved into the very face of the mountain."
