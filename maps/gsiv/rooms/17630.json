    "A plush bed is resting upon a gleaming brass frame, and has a canopy of fine snow white silk above it.  All of the walls are adorned with spidersilk bunting, and the presence of several scented candles adds to the romantic setting of this room.  A small table and chair have been placed in the cabin as well."
