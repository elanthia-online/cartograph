    "Pools of prismatic sunlight spill through the open manhole that is recessed into the ceiling, its colorful illumination creating moving patterns upon the smooth, cobblestone walls.  Rising through the opening, a rusted ladder provides egress from the area and is surrounded by large flakes of rust and bits of discarded fabric."
