    "Dirty, stagnant water stands knee-high to a gnome all around.  The upper half of a wooden coffin protrudes from a sunken grave, the lid nowhere to be found.  Inside, the torso of a headless skeleton rests in a grotesque position, one arm sticking out and waving with the slightest movement of the water."
