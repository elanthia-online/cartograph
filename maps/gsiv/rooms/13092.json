    "A riot of exuberant iceblossoms runs rampant over a lattice-work of stone, their defiant and delicate blooms hanging in great bouquets.  In the center of the hardy profusion, a rare moon-flower lifts its single, massive flower to the skies, as if seeking blessings from the sky.  Small icicles hang from the petals like lace.  The exterior of the garden is bounded by a rock wall, ringed by small, well-tended cottages."
