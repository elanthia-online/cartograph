    "Candlelight, cast from the windows of every home on the street, lights the cobblestones up in a hauntingly eerie dance of golden light.  Somehow, water has collected inside the glass case of a lantern, creating tiny luminescent ripples across the cobblestones below it.  A slinky, black cat moves with stealth across the street, his prey in his sights.",
    "Candlelight spills forth from the glaesine windows of each of the shops that are nestled into a single, long and low building built upon one side of the lane.  Awnings, neatly folded back and tied in place, form colorful arches over each shop's doorway, while artistic signs sway slightly in the night breeze.  Somehow, water has collected inside the glass case of a lantern, creating tiny luminescent ripples across the cobblestones below it.",
    "Stretching across one side of the lane is a single, long and low building that houses a wide variety of shops.  Sunlight pours across the colorful awnings, creating rectangular shadows on the ground that shift and change as the seaborne breeze tugs at them.  Artistic signs are strung upon wrought iron hangers over each shop's entry, their odd shapes and bright coloring eye-catching."
