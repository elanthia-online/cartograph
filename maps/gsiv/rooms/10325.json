  "description": [
    "Thick aubergine carpeting and heavy dark green velvet drapes help to muffle sound inside the bank, but the faint *clink* of coins can still be heard filtering from behind the bank's teller, who sits patiently waiting to help the next patron.  A small but elegant wrought iron chandelier hangs from the ceiling above, its amber glaesine globes casting a warm hue across the room."
