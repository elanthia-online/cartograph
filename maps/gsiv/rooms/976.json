    "Tall pines, cedars and firs compete for space in the surrounding forest.  The tree branches spread wide, shading the forest floor and creating circles of bare earth across the snowy field.  Many of the trees are old, large specimens with thick trunks good for hewing into structural lumber.  Here and there, in places where the light is particularly good, holly bushes have taken root.  Their jagged, sharp leaves protect an abundance of small berries.",
