    "Snow coats the ground across the lawn, yet a variety of indigenous wild flowers bloom within carefully ringed cultivated areas.  Snow lilies and pansies take up residence alongside larkspur and ice tulips.  The pale hues of the landscape create a glittering ice garden that sparkles in the sunlight like gold.  In the center of the lawn, an octagonal granite fountain flows with a soft bubbling sound, and a small earthenware bowl rests on the lip.  Set into the outer stone wall of the building, a set of glass double doors reveals the foyer within.",
