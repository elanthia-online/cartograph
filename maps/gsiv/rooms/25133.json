    "Crescent-shaped walls bow outward into a small seating area.  Placed next to an arched window, some wooden chairs with silk-cushioned seats are arranged around a wooden table, its top a showpiece of marquetry craftsmanship.  A pair of ethereal lanterns strung high overhead fill the area with an eerie, bluish white light."
