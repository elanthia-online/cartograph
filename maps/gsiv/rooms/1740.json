  "description": [
    "Tendrils of ice writhe overhead in a frozen dance.  Winding and weaving in a complex canopy, the ice forms an inverted bowl that descends to the ground on all sides except the northeast, where a large hole still allows egress.  The wind whistles musically through the ice strands, its speed changing along with its pitch as it courses through the unclosed holes in the roof.  The floor is a solid, smooth sheet of glassy ice."
