  "description": [
    "A gateway leading into the castle proper is close at hand, to the northwest.  From this vantage point, the castle's mighty towers and battlements seem impregnable.  The structure's beautiful ornamentation is evident here, from the richly carved arches with their scrollwork and fanciful friezes, to the hulking gargoyles perched on the ramparts of the flanking towers."
