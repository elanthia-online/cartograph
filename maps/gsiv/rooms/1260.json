  "description": [
    "Smooth granite walls taper into a narrow passageway.  Through the tunnel visible ahead, mining carts careen past upon a set of metal rails, screeching and whining their way under the DragonSpine.  Several dwarves move about the tunnel, efficiently getting passengers loaded and keeping the carts moving along."
