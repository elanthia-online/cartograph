    "Thick vines cover the walls of the small room.  Albatross feathers have been strung from the ceiling alongside strands of tiny shells.  A low wooden table sits to one side of the room with a small sign that reads \"Women.\"  To the other side of the room is a set of shell-carved wooden shelves with a sign that reads \"Men.\""
