  "description": [
    "Polished stone borders the clear water of a pool, its surface rippled by natural currents of an underground spring.  The water flows off at the back of the chamber, where it falls through a grate, down into the sea in a breathtaking torrent which sends rainbows arching from its spray.  Opposite the pool, a graceful wooden bridge spans the pool, giving access to an intimate grotto.  Expansive windows offer a panoramic ocean horizon framed by hanging baskets of draping ferns."
