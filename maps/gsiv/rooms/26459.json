    "Along the surface of a half-circle table, a variety of daggers sits on display.  Their sharpened edges catch the reflected light of the candelabra hanging above head, creating upon their glinting surfaces a chamber concert of metal and flame.",
    "A half-circle table dominates this otherwise unremarkable little room.  A few wobbly boxes face the table, serving as an improvised form of seating."
