    "Dark foliage gives a tunnel-like feeling to the plank-lined pathway, though it is several degrees less dense to the southeast than it is to the northwest.  Rising on the air is the pleasant aroma of roasting meats and the sweet scent of confections.  Two oaks create an arch that leads away from the midway toward the misty shores of Feywrot Mire.",
    "Dark foliage gives a tunnel-like feeling to the plank-lined pathway.  Rows of brightly colored inflated orbs have been tacked to a board placed just off the plank walkway.  A pile of sharp metal darts lies on a single raised plank that has been laid across two stumps to form a makeshift counter, while a dirty huckster lounges nearby.  Rising on the air is the pleasant aroma of roasting meats and the sweet scent of confections.  Two oaks create an arch that leads away from the midway toward the misty shores of Feywrot Mire."
