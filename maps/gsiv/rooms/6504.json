  "description": [
    "The furniture in this room seems to have withstood the passage of time well.  A large four poster bed stands against one wall.  There is a wooden chair in one corner, adjacent to a plain wooden table.  Against the north wall stands a large bureau, with torches mounted on the wall on either side of it.  There is a large frame hanging over the bureau, but there is nothing mounted in it."
