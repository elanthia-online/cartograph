    "Supported by tall modwir poles, the pale velvet of the pavilion drapes to the floor in soft waves.  Rich silk winds about each brace in rich ivory, crimson, and golden twists that are illuminated by a crystal lantern hung from a slender chain.  Thick animal skins give soft cushion to the hard floor and an area to display a group of mannequins."
