  "description": [
    "This area is very quiet except for the serene sounds of a tiny runnel of icy water tripping down the edge of the street.  Most of the hustle and bustle seems to be in front of the Temple, leaving this place devoid of activity.  A subtle pattern of interlocking rings is picked out in the cobblestones, lightly rimed with ice."
