    "Several large cells are set near each other along the north side of this room with straw-covered floors that have seen some use recently.  Timbers are lined up in this area and several have been erected to shore up the opening to the southeast but have yet to be completed.  An opening in the ceiling catches your attention and as you look into it, you notice a dark room some twenty feet above you.  At your feet are the remains of an iron ladder that is rusted and broken."
