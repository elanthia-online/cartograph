    "This dilapidated old ship hull appears to have once been a small fishing barge, the remnants now turned on their side and repurposed as an uneven lean-to.  The floor is covered in black sand from the nearby beach, while battered planks create a slanted wall, which once would have been the ship's deck.  A series of salt-encrusted hooks hang from the ceiling, while a large seaman's chest rests at the foot of a crooked wire stand."
