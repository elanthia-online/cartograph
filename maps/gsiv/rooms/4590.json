    "Racks of clay bottle-holders take up most of the floor space in this spacious and well-lit wine cellar.  Nestled in their own individual cradles, touching nothing but their supports are bottles of wine, made from the nearby vineyards.  Polished oak paneling covers the stone walls and the natural knots in the paneling resemble eyes.  In one corner of the room, a tall wood cabinet with stained glass is pushed up against the wall, its door stands slightly ajar."
