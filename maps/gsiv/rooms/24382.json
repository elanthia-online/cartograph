  "description": [
    "Shadowed by the massive bough of a gargantuan oak tree far to the north, the clearing is well-tended by its caretakers -- the grass is green and lush, and several colonies of flowers spring forth in the sunny spots of the rather shady respite.  A soft carpet of leaves mingles with the tall grasses, and the soft winds that whistle through the area occasionally send them into a spiraling dance before drifting back to the ground."
