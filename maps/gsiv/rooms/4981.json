  "description": [
    "Overhead tremendous stalactites dangle perilously high above the cavern floor.  A series of drawings are etched on the walls illustrating an ancient struggle.  Elven runes appear to be underneath several of the depictions.  Some are so old that they are almost indecipherable, while a few have obvious claw marks slashed through them.  In one of the far corners can be heard the rustling noises of small creatures."
