    "A plain wooden building stands near the edge of the airship docks.  Nondescript in appearance and lacking the usual stone cladding on so many city buildings, it would escape notice but for the large maoral sign attached to the wall near the front door.",
    "A few smoking timbers are all that remain of the wooden building that used to occupy this space.  Workers drag away the wreckage and sweep up debris from the area, while a stone mason begins laying out plans for the foundation of a new building.",
    "A small, sturdy limestone building has been built near the airship docks.  Its flat roof is shingled with slate tiles, and its front door, though painted a cheerful ocean blue color, is made of reinforced steel.  A large maoral sign has been tacked directly above the door."
