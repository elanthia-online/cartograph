  "description": [
    "White stucco walls, infused with dried ferns, support a latticework ceiling of mahogany that has a myriad of tiny multi-hued glass globes dangling from it.  Heavy green curtains hang from a copper curtain rod and separate the pint-sized bed from the equally as compact chair and table arranged near the middle of the room.  A mahogany door, its surface painted with a moon-lit mural, stands opposite from a pair of glass-paned doors that leads to the balcony beyond."
