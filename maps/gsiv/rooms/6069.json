    "The wide ribbon of barley continues its slow spiral.",
    "The wide ribbon of barley continues its slow spiral, like following the curvature of a ram's horn or a snail shell.  Unlike these examples from nature, the ribbon does not become any narrower as it moves toward the center.  The plants retain their same spacing, both between plants within a row and between rows.  The farmer's consistency is also displayed in the trenches that flank the barley ribbon.  These also do not vary in their width.",
