    "A utilitarian, grey stone wall of uneven courses surrounds a temple complex to the north.  In the center of the wall, opalescent grey spheres top the gateposts to either side of a high wooden gate.  The upper two-thirds of a tower, built in the same stone and style, and surrounded by scaffolding, is visible beyond the gate."
