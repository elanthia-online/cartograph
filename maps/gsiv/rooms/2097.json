    "This must have been the shipping entrance.  You see ruts worn in the dirt where heavy wagon loads of fish must have left the plant on numerous occasions.  Now there is nothing here but a few barrels of decayed matter.  You are not sure if it could have even been edible at any time in the past, but it sure is not now."
