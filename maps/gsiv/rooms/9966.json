    "A half-built wooden structure that seems to be either a half-built hut or a hut that has been half-destroyed stands at the edge of the woods amidst a sparse stand of young pine trees.  The ground is marked with dozens of footprints of orcs and hounds, and a distinct animal stench fills the air."
