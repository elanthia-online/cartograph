    "Ridges created by the most recent storm disrupt the beach with tracing mounds edging a deep runnel.  Inside the pool, stars and moonlight are reflected along the surface of the dark still water barely revealing a colony of baby starfish.  A ring of torches helps direct diggers away from the large sunken depression.",
    "Ridges created by the most recent storm disrupt the beach with tracing mounds edging a deep runnel.  Inside the pool, tiny crabs and baby starfish sparkle in the sun-warmed water.  Deep enough for wading and exploring, a few children accompanying the busy diggers frolic and squeal with each sea-life discovery."
