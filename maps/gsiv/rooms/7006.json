    "This space lies in between the inner and outer curtain walls of the castle.  The air here is damp and cold, and the wind blows constantly.  Ominous scratches in the inner curtain wall make you wonder if the castle really is abandoned.  To the east is the northeast guardtower, and to the outer ward continues to the west."
