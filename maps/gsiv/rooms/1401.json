    "The caravan route passes beneath the arching branches of a giant thrakwood bush, growing close alongside the trail.  About head level on a giantman, the branches are too high to be a hindrance to anyone shorter.  Moonlight reaches down through the canopy and softly highlights a cluster of snowblossoms in a clearing to the northeast.",
