    "The room is redolent with an unusual but piquant smell that you sense on the back of your tongue as much as through your nose.  Crates and barrels are stacked and made fast against the bulkheads.  Hanging at an odd angle from the ceiling are joints of meat wrapped in an orangish gauze and bound securely with lengths of twine."
