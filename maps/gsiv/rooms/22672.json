    "Several low shelves hang from the stone walls, displaying various containers of murky liquid.  A dim oil lamp hangs over a bloodstained wooden worktable that is situated in the center of the room, surrounded by pools of fresh gore on the floor.  A rotting corpse is slumped over up by the northern egress."
