    "The tunnel gently curves north and southeast.  Though easily overlooked in traversing tunnel's length, the southeast end seems to be somewhat higher than the north end, possibly the result of the miners following a vein of ore as they excavated in that direction.  The temperature also changes noticeably between ends, although the climate is uniformly dry.  The tunnel's southeast end is much cooler than the north end.  A pair of steel rails parallels the east wall."
