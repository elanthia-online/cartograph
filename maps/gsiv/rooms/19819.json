  "description": [
    "Scores of viciously slashed black silk banners flutter silently upon the walls in this large, round chamber.  The domineering presence of a statue to the south casts a long, foreboding shadow across the flawless white surface of the floor.  A feral snarl is etched upon the man's features, and his heavily-muscled form is captured in mid-attack, his scimitar raised upwards in a slashing arc.  A small, cloth-draped altar stands beneath the statue."
