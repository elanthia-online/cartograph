    "Floating lightly through the air, the aromas of vanilla bean and melted chocolate are quite evident inside the small wagon.  Soft amber silk brightens the walls, and the wooden floor bears an intricate design of glazed cobalt-patterned tiles.  The space is kept tidy and arranged simply, with spatial emphasis placed on a large golden ivory marble counter at the back.  Flanking the curtained entrance is a broad silk-lined shelf and a two-tiered oak stand."
