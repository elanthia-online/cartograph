    "The sticky sand walls are sopping wet with the constant drip-drip-drip of pungent ocean water.  A small, still tidal pool, likely left over from a recent high tide, remains at the bottom of the depression with tiny, clear crabs crawling slowly around it, making their way toward a soft unevenly formed sandbar.  The putrid stench of decaying fish pervades the area, and soft sloshing and squishing sounds can be heard from nearby.  A large crack in one wall looks wide enough to pass through."
