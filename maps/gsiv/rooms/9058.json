    "Polished oak cases line the long walls from limestone flooring to white-washed ceiling.  Books of every size and shape take up all available space on the rows of shelves, as well as litter several high-backed oak benches at the center of the room.  Silvery moonlight spills through the high window to illuminate the library's lone occupant as he sits in quiet study upon the window seat.  Glass spheres, filled with lit candles, stand upon iron pedestals at the four corners of the room offering a modicum of light.",

Bright sunlight streams through the rooms lone window and offers the perfect reading spot for the seat built into it.  A quilter's easel rests in the back corner where a blonde-haired woman gives a quiet lesson to a ring of much younger women."
