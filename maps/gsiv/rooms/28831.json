  "description": [
    "Spongy, stinking earth, likely heaped ashore by occasional floods from the nearby subterranean river, leaves only occasional humps of solid stone to breach up from the marshy terrain.  Just to the north, a sliver of higher ground is joined to a tall, spindly plateau.  Meandering stone steps climb the wall of the formation, marching up to an indistinct but vividly feminine figure worked from green stone.  It stands with outstretched arms."
