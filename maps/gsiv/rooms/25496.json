    "A candy-crafted ravenous kraken sculpture hangs on one of the refurbished driftwood walls, and a low syrup-flecked ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of an unfinished wooden floor.  There is a heavy lead glass display case on one side of the shop and a long glass-topped counter on the other."
