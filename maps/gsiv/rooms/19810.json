  "description": [
    "Rows of shelves line the curved, circular walls of this chamber, each displaying wares and other assorted fineries.  Crystal-paned cases hold other treasures within their faenor-bound frames, their sparkle enhanced by the numerous oil lamps positioned in precise locations in the small shop.  The faint scent of lilacs drifts in on errant currents of wind through the open door.  Several chests line the floor, and a small round table is set in the precise center of the room."
