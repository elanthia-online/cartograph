    "The candlelit windows of the bank illuminate the sky above creating an eerie, yet comforting sight.  The cottages that line the back wall and the corner of Honeysuckle Avenue and Rose Avenue seem small and unimportant compared to the towering bank rising up in the distance.  A plot of land just before the corner of the street has been left vacant, and over the years has become a gathering place for the moderately infamous and less desirable citizens of the town.",
    "The bank stands tall and proud in the distance, casting the smaller cottages that line the corner of Honeysuckle Avenue and Rose Avenue in shadows.  An empty lot just before the corner of the street has been left vacant, and over the years it has become a gathering place for the moderately infamous and less desirable citizens of the town."
