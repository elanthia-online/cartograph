    "Anchored to a rocky ledge jutting outward from a smooth wall of stone, this end of the rope bridge ends before a dark opening.  Nearly twice the height of the average human and just as wide, the gaping black maw yawns open, its center appearing dark in the faint glow of the pale moonlight.  The frequent creaks and groans of the old bridge, as well as the muted thunder in the gorge below, seem to urge cautious travelers toward the opening with their methodic song.",
