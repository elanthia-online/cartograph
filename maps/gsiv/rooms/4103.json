    "The sheer wall of the watchtower rises above you, casting a shadow over the rocky ledge overlooking the bay.  Seabirds circle the tower, occasionally descending to roost on the crags or dive into the expanse of blue water below for a meal.  A strong sea breeze whistles over the rocks and against the tower, drowning out any sounds of the town nearby.",

A few seabirds circle the tower, occasionally descending to roost on the crags or dive into the expanse of dark water below for a meal.
