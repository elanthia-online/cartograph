    "Neatly trimmed grass surrounded by bright white riverstones creates a quiet clearing set between two pathways.  Enormous boulders worn smooth at their tops are set around a sea glass ring and covered with thick blankets for comfort.  A pair of copper lanterns are set into the support poles of a small cottage, while a slender track leads around behind."
