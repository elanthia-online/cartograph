    "A series of three arches branch off to the west, each a fine example of masonry.  The gentle luminescence of giant glowing toadstools cast upon the foyer's stonework illuminates their cleanly hewn surfaces.  Standing forefront, a life-sized statue wrought of bronze has been set upon a polished granite pedestal."
