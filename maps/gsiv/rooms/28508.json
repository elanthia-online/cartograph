    "Stark white against the gloom of the area, stones leeched of color rise like jagged teeth along the north edge of the small clearing, their smooth faces providing a line of defense against a hazardous plunge into the waiting sea below.  Tufts of silky yellow grass spread across the gently sloping landscape as it ascends toward an enormous cocobolo tree to the southeast.  Wind slips through the porous rocks nearby to create an eerie, whistling tune that is punctuated by the steady rhythm of crashing waves."
