    "Snaking its way between the stone ramparts and the more established streets of Magical Burrow is the sinuous path known as Enchantment Alley.  Tiny bare feet and boots of various size have left their prints in the muddy snow, and a few ramshackle buildings huddle against the ravages of the brutal north wind."
