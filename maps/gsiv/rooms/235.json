    "This quiet corner resembles a calm island amid the bustling life of Wehnimer's Landing.  At the west end, a low, broad dome is visible.  In the center of the square, several benches of polished wood and smooth stone surround a sculpture that stands as a sentinel before the Wehnimer's Museum.  Cast in bronze, the work imparts a sense of peace, calm and protection to the landscaped surroundings.  A gold plaque mounted on a gracefully chiseled malachite base stands before it."
