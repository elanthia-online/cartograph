    "Part of the eastern wall has collapsed into the passage, strewing rubble for several hundred feet in either direction and creating a sizeable mound that must be traversed.  Large, sharp chunks of hard, igneous rock protrude up through the pile of smaller pieces.  Although these chunks are boulder size, they do not succeed in blocking the entire passage, and it is relatively easy to circumvent them.  The break has exposed banded veins of dark stone within the mountainside.",
