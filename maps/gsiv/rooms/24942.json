    "Especially slushy and slimy, a large pool of mud splays across the path, calling for care in footing.  Huts topped in palm fronds peek out from several directions, with the ever-present wall of jungle looming beyond them.  The surrounding trees bend over the pathway, their spread of branches and green shading the path entirely in shadow."
