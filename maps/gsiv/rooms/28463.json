    "A single back corner of the stony alcove is neatly organized and left primarily untouched, save for a plush nacre velvet settee placed behind a half-moon marble table.  Beeswax candles in domed glass lanterns are interspersed throughout the space, illuminating the recessed archway and furnishings with a soft, golden glow."
