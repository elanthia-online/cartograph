  "description": [
    "Tall dark green hedges border this area, blocking the view of the surrounding countryside.  Openings lead to the west, south, and east.  Several low stone tables hold a variety of bottles, beakers, ingredients, and herbs.  Lit torches stand beside each bench, and a soft carpet of closely cropped bluegrass blankets the entire area, providing a comfortable cushion on which to sit or scamper barefoot.  Bright silver canvas has been pushed under some of the hedges."
