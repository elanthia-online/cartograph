    "The river swells as it strikes a massive boulder in midstream, forming eddies along each bank.  A deep pool is created as a result of the conflicting flows cutting into the streambed.  Despite the depth, the gravel and mosses at the bottom of the pool are clearly visible.  Nourished over the centuries by the river it grows next to, a gnarled old oak towers above.  Dangling from one of its limbs is a knotted rope."
