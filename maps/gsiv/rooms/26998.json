    "Slopping slightly, gold-veined tiles slink across the smooth basin as they follow the circular path of the protective dome of energy that preserves the air and casts off the shroud of space.  Slipping across the horizon, dozens of meteorites disappear as they dance through the sky and leave brilliant tails of white in their wake."
