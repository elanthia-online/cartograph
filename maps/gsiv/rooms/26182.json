    "[Glass Peach Pit Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Many dried peach pits have been incorporated into the thick slab of glass that forms the top of this table.  The peach pits have been arranged in an intricate flower design.  Wrought iron table legs fashioned to look like grapevines hold the slab up.  A small vase sits in the middle of the table, bursting with various colorful blossoms."
