    "The garden teems with flickering fireflies and pale colored flora that encroaches on the path beneath the canopy of the surrounding dogwood trees.  White cobble walkways gleam faintly in the moonlight, leading the way towards a stately manor house to the north and a large lake that guards the eastern edge of the property.",
    "Lush and crowded, this garden teems with numerous azaleas and rhododendrons that thrive beneath the protective canopy of flowering pink dogwood trees.  Carefully planted and manicured, this garden still manages to look somehow wild and natural.  White cobble walkways lead through the brightly colored foliage to a stately manor house to the north and a large lake that guards the eastern edge of the property."
