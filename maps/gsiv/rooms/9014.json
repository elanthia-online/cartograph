    "Two dogs wander aimlessly in the passageway, pausing to sniff along some unseen trail.  The loud clatter of cans sends them running off, tails tucked between their legs.  A pair of lovers hide in the shadows, in an attempt to conceal the illicitness of their affair, only to be startled by the sudden noise.",
    "Two children play hide and seek in the passageway, their voices and laughing echoing loudly.  Tiny feet running up and down steps reverberate with a hollowness to their sound.  A young woman carries several packages, balancing them with the skill of a juggler, as she makes her way along the subterranean egress."
