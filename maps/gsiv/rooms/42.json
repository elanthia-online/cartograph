    "The hillside climbs steeply northward, as sheer cliffs tower overhead to a dizzying height.  The well-worn cobblestoned road winds its way towards the cliffs from the valley floor.  To one side of the road, a small guard tower houses two elven guards, each of whom is diligently observing the few travelling this road at night.  A lone torch burns at the base of the tower, casting a dim glow across the features of those who pass.",
