    "On this side of the macabre design, the cavern walls become extremely uneven, with deep pockets and niches that aren't visible from further away.  In one particular cranny, a small skeleton shelters, still curled in its death repose.  Behind another outcrop, a dark recess can be seen, looking as though it might yield passage into the stone wall."
