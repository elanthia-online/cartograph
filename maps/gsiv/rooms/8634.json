    "Wrought iron candelabras occupy opposite corners of the room, casting a series of flickering shadows along the ceiling and walls.  Multicolored throw rugs patterned with interlocking spheres are scattered throughout the basement.  An oddly shaped table and a single ladder-back chair rest in the far corner of the room near an old pot-bellied stove."
