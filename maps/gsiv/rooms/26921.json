    "Darkly stained oak boards span the width of the floor and are polished to a high sheen.  Lengths of gauzy fabric in a multitude of colors drape from the pinnacle of the ceiling to attach various rings set into the walls.  Oversized pillows fill the corners, and a square mirror sits on a small stand."
