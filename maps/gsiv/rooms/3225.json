    "A slight grade makes traversing this section of the path a bit more challenging.  The fight to maintain balance has been lost many times, apparent from the arm-deep holes next to several footsteps.  Chimneys thick with smoke protrude from the rooftops of buildings that begin to crest over the city walls from this angle."
