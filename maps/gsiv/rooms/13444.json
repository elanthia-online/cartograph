    "Further passage is blocked by a formidable monir door, bound with thick iron bands and fitted with a hasp locked with a large iron padlock.  Odd and out of place, it appears to be much newer than the catacombs themselves.  A metal torch sconce is mounted on the stone wall beside the doorframe, though it is bereft of any light source."
