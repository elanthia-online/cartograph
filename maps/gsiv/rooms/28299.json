  "description": [
    "A thick mulberry carpet runner traverses the full length of the landing, connecting the west wing to the east.  The roseate tones in the marble-tiled steps of the staircase extend to the surrounding walls and blush velvet curtains framing the tall windows at each end.  Facing a solid linden door, a trio of oil-on-canvas portraits hangs above a cherrywood sideboard on which sits a slender glass vase filled with cream roses in full bloom."
