    "Low sloping hills stretch away from the river in all directions, rampant with tall clumps of grass.

    "Low sloping hills stretch away from the river in all directions, rampant with tall yellow and green clumps of grass.  Given the slightest excuse, flocks of pure white birds break from hidden nests and wheel across the sky, settling again like gently falling snow.  To the north, the land slopes quickly upward to the lower slopes of V'Tull.",
