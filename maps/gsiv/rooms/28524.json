    "Tattered, sun-bleached canvas is draped over the wooden bows of the wagon frame, providing a makeshift shelter against the island winds.  The floor is littered with straw from unpacked crates that have been overturned and used as displays for merchandise, while unopened boxes are stacked at the far back of the wagon.  A short set of steps lead out of the wagon."
