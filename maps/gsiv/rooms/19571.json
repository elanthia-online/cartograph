    "Several bamboo arbors come together to make a circular dome.  Covered in bougainvillea and blue butterfly vine, the arbors provide protection from the elements to the small office below.  Tendrils of foliage drape across the front of a small desk of teak, which gleams from care.  Upon the desk sits a small teapot with a teacup and saucer.  Behind it, a rocking chair with a light blanket in plaid matching the colors of the flowers, sways gently with the breeze."
