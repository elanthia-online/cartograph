  "description": [
    "Curved marble walls enclose an expanse of patterned floor, its mosaic a striking composition of black, white and grey.  Across the elaborate floor decoration, plush rugs create glowing islands of color in shades of red and gold.  Large pillows, matching the tones in the rugs, one a myriad of color, another in bright red and blue and a third in red accented with a diamond overlay, lie in luxurious piles interspersed with low tables crafted of polished ebony."
