    "Branching away from the primary hall, a small opulent alcove is recessed from the main walkway.  Glittering emerald plates are arranged in a forked tessellation along the trio of walls, their sunlit facets casting a deep viridian glow over the space.  A bronze helicoid reliquary is preserved in the back, just below a series of narrow clerestory windows."
