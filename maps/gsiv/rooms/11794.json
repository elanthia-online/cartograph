  "description": [
    "Those living in the nearby shacks have set up several crude wooden cages and snares in the hopes of catching dinner, but a close inspection of the devices reveals they have succeeded in trapping nothing other than some green algae.  One of the jawed snares has slammed shut, but it too is empty, the animal evidently outsmarting the contraption and running off with the bait."
