    "[Mist Harbor, Peninsula]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The loam and silt of the recently-submerged earth that forms this peninsula is sporadically dotted with various forms of plant life, lying limp without the supporting waves.  On three sides, the water is held aside by unseen hands, forming an invisible wall that holds back the angry sea.  A decrepit rope bridge stretches from one end of the peninsula back towards the mainland, barely skirting the unnaturally stationary water beneath it."
