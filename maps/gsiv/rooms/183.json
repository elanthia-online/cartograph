    "The var is lined on both sides by neatly kept cottages, their walls crafted of deep grey granite blocks and roofs covered with deep blue tiles.  Flowering trees and plants fill the small gardens surrounding each home.  A few windows, candles shimmering on the sashes, glow brightly in the night.",
    "The var is lined on both sides by neatly kept houses, their walls crafted of marble and their roofs covered with deep blue tiles.  Each home is nearly on top of its neighbor, with several buildings sharing walls between them.  The rare house standing by itself stands out, as does the unflickering blue light that glows about its pediment.",
