    "The var is lined on both sides by neatly kept houses, their walls crafted of marble and their roofs covered with deep blue tiles.  Each home is nearly on top of its neighbor, with several buildings sharing walls between them.  The rare house standing by itself stands out, as does the unflickering blue light that glows about its pediment.",
