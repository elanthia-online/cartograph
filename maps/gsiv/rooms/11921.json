  "description": [
    "The soft coo of birds comfortably nested in the branches overhead pervade the night.  Somewhere not far distant, a chorus of crickets chirp, harmonious accompaniment to the rustle of leaves blown by a sighing wind.",
    "The twitter of birds going about their daily business fills the surrounding woods.  Speckled beams of sunlight dance past the branches overhead and touch the blossoms and herbs growing on the forest floor like a bright benediction."
