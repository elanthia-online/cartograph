  "description": [
    "The sloping sea of bones and the vertical walls are barely visible in the dim, flickering light provided by the fireflies.  Their abdomens wink on and off, and, individually, would not be enough to light much of anything.  Given the amount of fireflies, though, the area is bathed in a wavering, barely perceptible green glow.  The strobe effect from so many fireflies makes it seem as if many of the bones are moving slightly, but it must be a trick of the light."
