    "The tunnel expands here into a small cave.  Yellow strands of vapor rise towards the ceiling from a large natural hot spring in the center of the cavern.  Steam pours from several fissures in the ground surrounding the spring, and the air is warm and humid.  You notice two holes in the ceiling that the steam seems to escape through.  Strangely, the holes do not look natural."
