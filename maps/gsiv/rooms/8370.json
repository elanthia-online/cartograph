  "description": [
    "Immense outcroppings of stone protrude from the walls in this bend of the corridor, their exteriors as thickly carved with blocky sigils as the smoother sections.  They offer surfaces from which cling a plethora of shadows.  The air has grown cold and clammy, and dust leaps from the gloom each time the coiled passageway shivers in the clutches of successive tremors."
