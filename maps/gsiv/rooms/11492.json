    "Scrub grass grows in wild clumps in this small ward.  A large wooden gate on the eastern side of this gatehouse was evidently barricaded at one time.  The heavy timbers that barred the gate have been removed and lie rotting on the ground.  To the west, a heavily pitted portcullis has been raised to allow entrance to the courtyard that is visible beyond.  A broad flight of stairs descends into a shadowy room below."
