    "[The Broken Stein, Office]"

  "description": [
    "Devoid of windows, the small office is sparsely furnished and has a single brass-sided lantern that provides scant illumination.  Stacks of papers rest upon the corner of an abused desk that is fashioned of dark-stained oak.  A small crate, turned on its side, appears to be the only seat available, while a wide open door leads into the small bar room to the east."
