    "The bustling octagonal apartment is small and cramped for its level of activity.  Young halflings in robes run about, carrying all sorts of wands and rods in various shapes and sizes.  A small table swathed in black velvet sits at the center of the chamber, home to a small black modwir coffer that seems to be the nexus of all the activity."
