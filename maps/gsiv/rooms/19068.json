  "description": [
    "The main deck narrows just aft of the tall foremast, where the deckhouse begins.  Barrels are stacked and secured against the rise of the forecastle deck.  A slatted door leads into the deckhouse, and from the squeaks, squeals and halfling giggles coming from inside, it's a good bet the door leads into crews' quarters."
