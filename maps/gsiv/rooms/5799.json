    "The mine shaft widens into a square chamber strewn with evidence of past habitation.  Shards of shattered drinking vessels, a crate encrusted with candle-wax, and a pair of broken stools beside the makeshift table suggest that the chamber was once a resting place for miners.  A thick layer of dust on the crude furnishings bespeaks many years' disuse."
