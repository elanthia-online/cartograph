    "The remains of broken shells and shattered wood litter the shoreline, providing a home for countless scavenger creatures to rest in during the night.  The surf takes its toll on the constantly shifting sand of the beach, yet the beauty of the ocean's moonlit horizon remains.  Hazy shafts of moonlight glint off of the splash of pink barely visible beneath the murky ocean water farther out in the waves, calling attention to the presence of a massive coral reef."
