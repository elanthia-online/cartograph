    "Torches set into the walls brightly light the wide space, which is littered with small pools of water spread between clusters of stalagmites.  Overhead, varied stalactites drip water, creating drip-drop sounds to the effect of a natural musical instrument.  Spiraling around a flat, open space, almost like a clearing in this underground forest, several limestone columns are covered in crude carvings."
