    "Here, metal scraps and parts of armor lay in disrepair across a scarred oak table that takes up a large part of the available space.  Set on the outer edge of the table in presentation are suits of armor and a variety of pieces meant for sale.  Behind the table is a stool and a plethora of metalworking tools."
