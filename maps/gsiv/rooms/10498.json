    "Some horrendous maelstrom careened through the forest, snapping oaks and elms like matchsticks and leaving debris piled here and there across the landscape.  A particularly large deposit landed squarely atop the road, its snarled limbs and underbrush forming quite a daunting barrier against travel to the southeast.",
    "The top of a massive limestone coliseum peeks above a dense forest of trees that marches off to the south.  Large oaks and elms form a stately archway over a verdant path that leads deeper into the forest.  A a sturdy barricade has been pushed aside allowing travel south."
