    "The thick stands of elm in this area look devastated.  Many of them have fallen over or split in two, their leaves gone, their branches withered and blackened.  The trunks display scores of holes as if many small things had bored into the trunks, or something had smashed holes in the trunks in search of something else.  Others are barely alive with only a few leaves still attached to the ends of branches.  Here and there healthy specimens still stand, but they are very few and far between."
