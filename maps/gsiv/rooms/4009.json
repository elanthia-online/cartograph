    "Torches cast flickering light across the stone walls of this cavernous shop.  The high walls terminate in a vaulted roof high above, fashioned of thick wooden timber.  Various pieces of metalwork hang suspended from the beams above.  A long wooden counter stands before a curtained doorway through which employees occasionally wander."
