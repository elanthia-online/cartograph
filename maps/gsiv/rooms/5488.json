    "Pale beneath the moonlit sky, splintered bones poking up through tufts of dark fur, and a fanged jawbone, are all that remain - mute testimony to a wolf that chose as its prey a Bresnahanini's Rolton that was not as sick and feeble as it appeared.  Then again, perhaps it was just in a particularly bad mood.",
