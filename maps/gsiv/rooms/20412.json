    "[Abandoned Church, Chancel]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Unlike the rest of the church, the chancel is restored almost to its former glory.  Varnished wood paneling encloses the room, with religious relics displayed upon it.  A glossy stone floor leads up to a gold-inlaid ironwood lectern and branches off toward the east and west.  To the north of the chancel is an ornate crown-shaped altar carved from white oak, which creates a dominating presence in the church.  Behind the altar is a stained-glass mosaic of the Great Drakes, their forms barely visible due to the lack of moonlight."
