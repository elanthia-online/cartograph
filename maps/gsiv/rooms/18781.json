    "An antique wall hanging hangs on one of the patterned white walls, and a painted nightscape ceiling rises overhead.  A verdant elderberry bush sits in one corner of a cream-colored ceramic tile floor.  There is a gold-trimmed ebonwood chest on one side of the shop and a wide faenor-trimmed table on the other."
