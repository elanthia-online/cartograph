    "Multitudes of beds in a huge variety of styles and finishes lie stacked haphazardly around the shop, some tilting precariously.  Small pathways wind between the items, giving customers just enough room to view the floor samples.  At one end of the showroom, a collection of stately four-poster beds enjoys a more spacious display area and the benefit of subtle lighting."
