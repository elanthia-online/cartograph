    "A narrow trail threads through the dark jungle growth, skirting plants the size of houses and trees that tower into the shadows above, their tops lost in moonlit fog.  Long vines hang down from branches, carrying a thick, stringy moss that beards the foliage around it.  Visibility is restricted to mere steps away in any direction.",
    "A narrow trail threads through the heavy jungle growth, skirting plants the size of houses and trees that tower into the air above, their tops lost in mist and low clouds.  Long vines hang down from branches, carrying a thick, stringy moss of a grey color that blends with the shadowed tones of foliage.  Visibility is restricted to mere steps away in any direction."
