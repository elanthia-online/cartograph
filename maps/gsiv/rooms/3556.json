    "A perfectly fitted floor of grey granite tiles meets elegant pilastered stone walls.  A row of arched windows face onto the street, allowing shafts of yellow sunlight to dimly illume rows upon rows of huge packing crates.  An ancient escritoire on spindly carved legs stands in one corner of the room, neatly stacked with price lists and contracts.",
