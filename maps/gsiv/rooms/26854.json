    "A small, blackened altar sitting upon a circular rug takes up most of the ornate alcove.  In front of the altar is an ebon locker, its hinges rusted and twisted into odd angles.  Atop the altar is the burnt outline of a humanoid being, strange snake-like outlines can be seen on either side of it."
