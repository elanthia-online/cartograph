    "Boot prints in frozen mud lead in and out of the mid-sized shed.  The smell of freshly fallen snow rides on the crisp, cold air that occasionally blows through, stirring up the scent of oiled leather mixing with fresh linen from the containers for sale herein.  Several giantmen and one halfling huddle around an ancient, rusted stove propped on half-log benches near the back of the structure.  They share the latest town gossip whilst rubbing their hands together and taking swigs from small flasks for warmth"
