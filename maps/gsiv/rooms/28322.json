    "The sweet smell of cookies hangs in the air, overlaid by the rich aroma of roasting pork.  A spit turns in the fireplace at the narrow end of this room while a brick wall oven radiates warmth.  The heavy oak counters and center table are immaculate and provisions and utensils are stored neatly, poised for the next large feast preparation.  Several arched crystal windows are dark with nightfall, the room lit by damascened brass sconces.  At one end of the room hangs a wall tapestry."
