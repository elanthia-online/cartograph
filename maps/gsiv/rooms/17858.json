    "A staircase leading down to the cellar is flanked on either side by oaken pedestals topped with decorative statuary.  Framed portraits and landscapes done in a variety of styles line the outer wall.  While each piece of art is aesthetically pleasing in its own right, the ensemble as viewed together seems somewhat mismatched.",
