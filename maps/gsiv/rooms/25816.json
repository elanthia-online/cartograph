  "description": [
    "An elaborately carved low maoral railing provides a view of the common area below the captain's loft.  A wooden plank stairway leads downwards, and pushed up against the hull of the ship is a brightly painted pink fel bunk bed, covered in an assortment of knitted quilts.  A pair of paintings covers the rear wall of the loft, framing a glass-paneled bright green door.  Glass-paneled lanterns hang from wrought bronze hooks in the beams overhead."
