  "description": [
    "All the varied dry goods that a dwarf would need for day-to-day living seem to be on display in this store.  The displays may seem more packed, however, because the store itself is so very small.  A sales desk sits near the south wall and provides a place where the proprietor can transact business.  Pushed into a corner, one tall toadstool in a lone stone pot does its best to light the area.  The only means of exit is through a crude stone arch."
