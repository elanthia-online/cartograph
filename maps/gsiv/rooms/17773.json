  "description": [
    "The mouth of the cavern passage leads from behind a waterfall into a frozen lagoon.  Once-lush vegetation is now glazed over with a coating of ice that has sealed it in a timeless prison.  A frozen sheet of ice hangs like a curtain over the outer surface of the waterfall, while beneath, the water still cascades freely down into the lagoon, its natural forces unabated by the arctic conditions."
