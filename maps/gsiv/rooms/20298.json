    "Slender water oaks are abundant along the pathway, with a few leveled stumps indicating where some were harvested for fuel or timber.  Broken acorns crunch beneath the feet of those passing by and litter the browned grasses beneath every tree.  Wild turkey droppings and deer tracks among the fallen acorns indicate they are a favored food source for the wildlife here."
