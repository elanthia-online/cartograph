  "description": [
    "This tiny stone room is well lighted by cleverly inset wall sconces placed on either side of the entry, and by a second pair to either side of a northwestern passageway.  Shoved against the eastern wall is a sturdy oak table with an iron weapons rack leaning against it.  A plain wooden barrel has been placed off to one side of the room near the northwestern passage."
