  "description": [
    "Broad stone steps, cracked and broken where wild jungle vines have pushed their way through the seams, lead down to a small clearing littered with crushed white seashells.  Rising on either side of the steps are alabaster columns that have long ago lost the roof they once supported.  Standing in the center of a broken arch is an embroidered silk screen facing an oak panel across rough stone slabs.  The entry continues to the north where a wide courtyard can be seen in the distance."
