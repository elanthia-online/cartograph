    "The walls of this octagonal turret room stretch several floors upwards toward an intricate stained glass dome overhead.  Several softly glowing orbs float suspended at each landing, illuminating countless books lining the library's upper floors.  Rich mahogany bookcases encircle the ground floor, framing a carved lor archway leading out, while two deeply cushioned armchairs rest around a small round mahogany table upon a finely woven rug in the center of the area."
