    "A pure ivory arch houses a simple statue of a smooth-faced youth -- both white and black rose bushes flanking its sides, while thorny vines of crimson roses crawl over the apex of the structure.  Three round bowls are set before the downturned gaze of the youth, arranged in a triangular pattern with the uppermost bowl tinted a deep carmine.  The dark, tranquil waters of a pond sparkle behind the statue, the glimmering sapphire shards of starlight playing across its surface wanly.",
