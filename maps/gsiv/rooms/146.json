  "description": [
    "A carved oak service bar separates the customers from the workspace in this large kitchen.  A small host of cooks and their helpers bustle about their chores in an efficient, if poorly choreographed, ballet.  Open firepits line the far wall, with spacious ovens built into the brick above.  Several large tables in the center of the room are covered with ingredients in the process of being chopped, sliced, diced, and minced in preparation of one dish or another."
