    "One wall is entirely missing from this room, the swamp oozing in from outside.  A wooden bowl holding brushes, combs, rust-edged tools, and colorful bottles sits in the middle of a shallow pool of mud.  Two lengths of blue silk drape down from the half-ceiling overhead, emphasizing the dull surroundings rather than beautifying them.  Broken white parts of a wash basin are partially buried in the mud.  A small circle of candles lends greater to brightness to the moonlight shining in from overhead.",
