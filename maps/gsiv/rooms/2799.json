    "A stark ray of light breaks through the pine boughs, casting a puddle of light on the ruts of the path like a spotlight.  Fine flakes of snow drift down through the beam, swirling and drifting in response to the wind's melody.  The trees standing like an audience to either side seem darker and quieter than they are, as though they are transfixed by the beauty of the performance.",
