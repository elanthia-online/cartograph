    "Artifacts and paintings litter this room, the metal bits glittering in the light of several oil lanterns mounted to the walls.  A life-sized wax figure stands in the center of the room, while a scale model of the Glaesen Star rests off to one side.  One particularly well-preserved painting with an imflass frame hangs on the wall near a velvet-lined display case."
