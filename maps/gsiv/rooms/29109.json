  "description": [
    "This open-air terrace juts from the mountain at a dizzying height.  A bird's-eye view of the town of Kraken's Fall spreads out below, its cobblestone streets basking in the warmth of the sun.  The rising and falling swells of the blue-green ocean stretch toward the distant horizon.  The gentle fragrance of the forest below dances lanquidly within the cool mountain breeze."
