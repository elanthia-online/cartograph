    "Along the south side of the walk, the visible Fisherman's Quay is surrounded by a flurry of daytime activity.  Lobster skiffs come and go, unloading their catch and hurrying their wares to Fishmarket Pier a bit further beyond.  A series of shacks side-by-side on a massive wooden structure, the marketplace extends out into the bay, guaranteeing the freshest selection.",
    "Along the south side of the walk, the visible lights of Fisherman's Quay reveal a quiet night compared to the flurry of daytime activity.  Lobster skiffs are tied up along the docks, or moored a slight distance away."
