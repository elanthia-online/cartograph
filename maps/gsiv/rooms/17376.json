    "You are standing on a small stone ledge which once supported the great beams which held up the wooden floor of this room.  All of the flammable parts of this tower have been destroyed, however, leaving the walls stained with black streaks of soot and smoke and the tower a gutted hulk, open from the dirt floor well below you to the circular opening which was once the roof high above."
