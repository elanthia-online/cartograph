    "The chamber's lighting falls short halfway across the cellar, as the shadows twist from the cast light of a lantern.  Rows of several strange apparatuses are barely visible in the shadows along the walls, each with a strange fluid leaking from them.  Moisture runs down the stone walls in several locations, using the natural contours of the stone as a ramp to the floor.  Looming just within reach overhead is a heavy trapdoor leading back to the chambers above."
