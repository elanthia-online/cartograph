    "Just to the east a copse of trees stands with the sounds of a stream trickling through it.  The grove is an inviting sight in comparison to the dry, dusty scrub area around.  To the northwest, the stream disappears down a deep ravine with sides that defy climbing.  If one is to travel in that direction, one will have to ascend into the hills to the southwest.  The breeze blows warmly through the area, picking up all the moisture it can find."
