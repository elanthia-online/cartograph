  "description": [
    "Rising several handspans from the smooth floor, an alabaster-tiled travertine railing encircles the balcony that is exposed to the open air.  Stretching upon the horizon is a thin avenue surrounded by cypress trees, while nearer at hand and far below is the verdant Garden of Order.  An illuminated teleportation disk recessed into the ground flashes with a steady pulse and fills the air with a gentle humming sound."
