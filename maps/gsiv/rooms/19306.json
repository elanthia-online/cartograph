  "description": [
    "Beneath the crystal ceiling of the greenhouse, the air is heavy with humidity.  Small droplets of condensation drip down constantly in a light shower from above.  Numerous rows of potted plants, flowers and herbs sit on neatly aligned shelves, stretching along both sides of the walkway that leads through the building.  Large bags of potting soil as well as neatly labeled pouches of seeds occupy the far end of the area.  Several rare plants are labeled and squared off in one corner."
