    "A small blue slate-clad manor house sits back from the var, apparently enjoying a second life as a shop judging from the small mithglin sign posted on the front steps.  Sweet-smelling fruit trees frame the manor's rough-hewn slate facade.  Tiny glaesine globes mounted on small iron stakes cast a gentle glow across the area.",

    "A marble-clad manor house sits back from the var, apparently enjoying a second life as a shop, judging from the small silver sign posted on the front steps.  Sweet-smelling fruit trees frame the manor's smooth white facade.  Tiny glass globes mounted on small argent stakes cast a gentle glow across the area.",
