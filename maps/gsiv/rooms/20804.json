  "description": [
    "A carefully cultivated carpet of rich grass grows, high on top of House Sovyn.  A multitude of different-sized flowers grows amidst low trees giving you the sense of being in the middle of a small forest.  Unobtrusive benches are placed around the garden allowing one to sit and relax.  Directly in the center of the roof several large stone pillars sit in a circle and a small covered stairway in the corner leads back down into the house.",
