  "description": [
    "The soft ground inclines sharply, reaching upwards until finally breaking through the thick plane of mist surrounding the treetops.  Surrounding the small circle of earth is a view of nothing but haze, giving the illusion of floating among a wide stretch of clouds.  Bright rays of moonlight are instantly broken into hundreds of rainbows in the white mist below.  Echoes of rushing water floats through the air, and the rocky protrusions of a natural stone bridge jut from the earth to the southwest."
