    "The dirt road ends in a small cul-de-sac bounded by a circle of flowerbeds that contain a variety of blooming weeds.  A small stone well stands at the center of the road, and passers-by lower the bucket for a drink or to carry a pot of water back to their home.  The pleasant voice of a woman singing a familiar Dwarven drinking song echoes from a nearby cottage."
