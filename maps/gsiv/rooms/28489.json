    "Walls painted in muted shades of white and blue surround you, imparting the feeling of the expansive outdoors within the sparse confines of the room.  Steam rises in languid wisps from a small circular pool within the center of the room, the slight haze obscuring the puffy, swirling clouds rendered upon the ceiling.  A small pale white bench sits near the eastern wall, a table draped with a covering of the same hue positioned directly next to it."
