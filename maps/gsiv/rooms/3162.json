    "A battered and broken row of stones runs alongside the dirt path.  What had once served as a fence lies strewn about in disarray.  Snow now replaces the masonry where obvious breaks can be seen in the fence.  In the distance, the remains of a structure are visible beyond the sparse evergreen ferns that dot the landscape."
