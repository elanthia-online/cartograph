    "The faint smells of tobacco, vanilla, and flora intoxicate the area.  Water tumbles down the eastern side of the cave's wall in a cascading miniature waterfall that forms into a pool surrounded by an array of wildflowers and moss.  A series of intertwining ivy stretches towards a single burst of moonlight that streams through a hole in the ceiling bathing the garden.  Shelves that have been carved into the rock hold an array of vials and flasks, while a burnished kakore table sits off to the corner."
