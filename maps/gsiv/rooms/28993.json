    "Large pillars stretch toward the ceiling and support enormous oak beams, as well as an exposed rafter ceiling.  Along the eastern and western edges, and closets to the various windows, planking stations are arranged where oak, mahogany, and maple boards are refined for use in ship flooring.  The central aisle is flanked by various collapsed hammocks in a wide variety of shapes, colors, and materials, while at its center sits an oak-paneled counter with hurricane lanterns suspended over it."
