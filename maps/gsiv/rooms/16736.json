    "Intermixed amongst the carpet of fallen leaves are scattered stones that increase in number to the north.  In contrast, the great trees of the forest thin out along the same direction, leaving only a darker woods to be traversed to the south.  Standing alone, not far off the trail, is a solitary boulder surrounded by scrub brush."
