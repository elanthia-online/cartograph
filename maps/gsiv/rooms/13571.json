  "description": [
    "Textured black silk walls rise from a glossy black ebonwood floor.  Just above a mantling griffin statuette hangs an ancient battered tower shield, and a sturdy oak beam ceiling completes the picture.  A twisted dark metal rack and a gold-veined black marble counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
