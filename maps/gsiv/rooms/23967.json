    "Vines criss-cross the floor, invaders from outside having taken advantage of the lack of properly functioning windows and doors.  Beside a window sits a small maple desk surprisingly clear of the ongoing assault by nature elsewhere in the run-down home.  What other furniture remains is decayed and skeletal, echoes of a once former vibrant home, and as forgotten and abandoned as much of the port."
