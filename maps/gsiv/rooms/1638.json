  "description": [
    "From the top of the boulder you can see much of Teorainn Valley.  The narrow creek widens as if flows east into a small lake.  Directly across the creek the terrain rises sharply among rocky escarpments.  Across the lake to the northeast a scattering of old wooden structures stand beside a field of tall yellow flowers.  To the south is a path that slopes downward through the woods."
