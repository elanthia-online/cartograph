    "The outer rim curves southward to an odd shiny depression on the east wall and westward into a hazy fog of steam.  The walls echo with the sibilant hiss of steam, and somewhere just at the edge of mortal senses, a more sinister sound slips across the chamber.  Older than the liquid stone thrown up from Elanthia's heart and colder than the Dark Moon circling above, the faintest echo of Luukos' forked tongue echoes out of your imagination and plays across your soul."
