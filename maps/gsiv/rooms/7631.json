    "Gaining the top of the boulder, you pause to drink in gulps of cool sea air.  The surface here is mostly flat and bare, though covered with minute cracks and fissures.  The surface of the rock is weathered a deep grey overlaid with a faint growth of moss in some of the deeper cracks.  A small tree has somehow taken root in the center of this stony place and seems to thrive."
