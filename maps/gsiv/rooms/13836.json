    "Colorful wildflowers blossom in this lush, untamed meadow garden.  Two weeping willows stand in a flowerbed of orange tiger lilies and pale blue forget-me-nots.  A small stream bubbles forth from an underground spring near the willows.  It flows in a deep-set, meandering path across the garden only to disappear down a small grotto covered in shy violets and viridian moss.  Deep green ivy and pink roses grow along the stone walls that surround the area, almost encompassing the oak double doors leading back inside.",
    "Beautiful arched windows in the outfacing walls overlook the carefully tended grounds of the courtyard below.  Tall dark bookshelves cover all the remaining wall space, each one thoroughly packed with a variety of literature.  The centerpiece of the room, a large table adorned with white wax candles, rests on a woven flaxen rug.  Beneath each window stands a low wooden desk with a matching straight-backed chair.  Several of these desks are stacked precariously high with various tomes and scrolls."
