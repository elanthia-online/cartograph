    "Marble flagstones separate walls lined with cabinets filled with vestments and shelves lined with prayer books, while a sky-lit cathedral ceiling provides excellent acoustics for the practice of liturgy and chant.  In the exact center of the room is a podium supporting a large volume.  Along one wall is a set of material-laden shelves and a fel prie-dieu."
