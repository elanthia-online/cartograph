    "Blue watered silk walls rise from a mistwood plank floor.  Just above a tiered alabaster fountain hangs a blue watered silk tapestry, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A silk-covered dress mannequin and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
