  "description": [
    "Beeswax candles drip from ornate iron sconces, the glow of the tiny, flickering flames nearly absorbed by the surrounding black stone walls and floor.  An enormous cauldron fills a walk-in fireplace, the sickly green, bubbling brew within giving off a noxious odor.  A wooden rack and a spindly oak table flank a curtained opening in the curved wall."
