    "A soft river breeze blows gently through the stucco shelter.  The occasional, plaintive cry of a sea bird can be heard over the sound of the river chuckling against the stones of the quay.  A pair of wicker benches with woven reed seats occupy two of the low shelter walls.  A low altar stands in the center of the shelter.",
