    "Huge boulders ring a small, circular area, with a cliff face to protect the far side.  The stones shield the spot from the oppressive heat, making it seem almost temperate compared to the raging fury on the other side of the barrier.  In stark contrast to the rough, blasted surroundings, a statue stands in the center of the clearing, formed of pale grey marble.  Its form is a model of strength and noble symmetry."
