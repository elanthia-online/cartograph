    "Walls of smoky grey, painted with lambent red, yellow, and orange flames, are illuminated by diffuse rays of moonlight that saturate the room through frosted glass windows etched with the alchemical symbol for fire.  Crafted of half-charred wood, wall sconces cradle pillar candles whose flickering flames glitter off bits of volcanic glass inlaid in the crimson ceramic tile flooring.  The musical tinkling of a wind chime can be heard from high above the brushed steel workbench as gentle breezes trickle in from the piazza.",
