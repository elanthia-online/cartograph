  "description": [
    "Bowing beneath the weight of dust-laden jars and boxes are shelves that line the four walls of the storage room from floor to ceiling.  Little tags are attached to the various containers by long brown threads, and hang over the side of their respective shelves to allow for identification without requiring the use of the ladder leaning against one wall.  A single glass vial lays shattered on the floor, perhaps the origin of a powerful stench that pervades the room."
