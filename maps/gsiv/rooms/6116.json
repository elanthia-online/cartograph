  "description": [
    "Towering over five hundred feet, the southern wall of the canyon stands like a void against the silvery night sky.  Rubble forms a ramp up to the western canyon wall where a ledge can barely be discerned high above.  The canyon junction can be seen to the distant east as the canyon turns again, around the central rock outcrop.  Heat wafts up from the canyon floor here, where it is almost uncomfortably warm, while small puddles of glowing yellowish water bubble to the surface.",
    "Towering over five hundred feet, the southern wall of the canyon blocks out half the sky.  Rubble forms a ramp up to the western canyon wall where a ledge can be seen about two hundred and fifty feet high.  The canyon junction can be seen to the distant east as the canyon turns again, around the central rock outcrop.  Heat wafts up from the canyon floor here, where it is almost uncomfortably warm, while small puddles of yellowish water bubble to the surface."
