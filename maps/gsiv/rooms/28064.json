    "Dirt and dust hang in the air, visibly twirling about with every little movement.  Horse tack is strewn about the area, the vast majority of it broken and abused collections of reins, bridles, straps, stirrups, and saddles, none of which seem to be actual sales merchandise.  Somewhat hidden amongst the clutter, a small halfling mutters to herself, loudly smacking her gums and rolling her eyes as she lounges against a display rack and idly kicks at several unfinished saddle trees at her feet."
