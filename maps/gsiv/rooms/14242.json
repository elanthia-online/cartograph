    "Limestone has been carved into rectangular blocks and stacked to enclose this garden, with several small arched openings set about mid-height into the walls.  Each of the cut-out niches holds a lush flowering plant and affords a tiny glimpse beyond, into the back alley and yards of neighboring buildings.  Several mistwood columns support a latticework covering overhead, from which drapes thick clusters of fragrant wisteria, attracting honeybees dancing amid the filtered sunlight beams.",
