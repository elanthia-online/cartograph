    "As you enter this cavern, it quickly opens up into a spacious dome.  The smoothness of the wall and the absence of digging lets you know this was all etched by nature.  The lava pools have receded leaving behind this area gutted in the rock, with just the heavy fog swirling about your feet to remind you that the walls are still warm enough to turn water to steam."
