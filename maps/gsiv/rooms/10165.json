    "Rushing downhill towards a clump of boulders, a thin stream covers what remains of a navigable trail in this slender gulch.  Many smaller rocks divide the path of the water, providing a rich environment for several wild mustard plants, their showy yellow flowers adding a touch of color to the neutral surroundings.",
