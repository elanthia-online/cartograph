    "A bundle of dried flowers hangs on one of the honey gold oak walls, and a low skylight-set ceiling rises overhead.  A well-pruned lemon tree sits in one corner of a golden blonde oak floor.  There is a floral-etched ceramic case on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
