    "A small brass cooking brazier stands on a tripod in one corner of the kitchen.  The planked ceiling above the brazier is smeared with soot, to which a thick layer of dust has attached.  Some shelving against the wall is filled with rotting bags and dusty jars.  A small barrel and a dusty crate stand near the doorway."
