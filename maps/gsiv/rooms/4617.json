  "description": [
    "Low stone walls surround the caravansary grounds, here in the shadow of Vornavis' north wall.  Easily visible over the low walls are the tops of the beast pens, the board-and-canvas roofs of the caravansary's less temporary structures, and the peaks of the caravaners' tents.  Two square stone pillars mark the ends of the walls and the entrance to the caravansary grounds.  Set into the pillars are a pair of wardstones."
