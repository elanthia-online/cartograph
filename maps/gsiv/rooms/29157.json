  "description": [
    "Discarded brushes and buckets filled with dried up paint are collected in a copper-banded barrel that sits between two tall support posts.  Triangles of red paint, three on the southwest and two on the northwest, have black numbers drawn within them that range from 11 to 15, while bold blocky letters beneath the shapes proclaim this area as \"Pier Four.\"  A small fishing basket dangles over the edge of the water, its interior empty and bait-free."
