    "A small stream runs through this section of the garden, and a moss-laden wrought iron bench is positioned to one side to allow visitors to rest near the cool water.  Cobblestone pathways offer travel within the lush flower beds growing in abundance throughout the area, and tall trees, branches spread wide to provide shade, dot the landscape."
