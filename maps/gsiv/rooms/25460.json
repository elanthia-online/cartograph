    "Dominating the center of the room is a chiseled glaes fountain, the maiden's forms posed towards a stag-carved mahogany bar.  Curve-accented statues of alabaster and ivory each offer a view of the shop's wares, their flat silvered trays held aloft.  Brushed lion and tiger hides serve as elaborate runners, leading to merchandise held elsewhere within the shop."
