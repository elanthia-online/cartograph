    "[Meandering Mandolin Table]"

  "description": [
    "Black obsidian shaped into a huge, flattened teardrop with a long neck perches atop two grey marble supports in the northeast corner of the tavern.  Four long channels cut from the end of the neck to the center of the teardrop and filled with a white mortar help bring alive the mandolin aspect of the table.  Strangely, though, the entire shape twists and turns, as if the stone mandolin is attempting to slide away from its accompanying chairs and ooze off to the southwest."
