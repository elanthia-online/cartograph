  "description": [
    "The wind whips strongly across the trapezoidal-shaped granite fortification.  The roar of heavy surf crashing against the seawall surrounds you with its disquieting procession frequently accompanied by spray.  A narrow stone quay extends northward into the grip of the unfriendly sea, with a narrow stairwell climbing the fortress wall on the landward side.  Atop a raised platform at the center of the landing is a massive oak ballista."
