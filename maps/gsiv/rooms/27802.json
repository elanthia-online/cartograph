    "Fiery swaths of color cut through the vivid hues of the flowers to the sides of the path -- the lurid color of the cluster of flamestalks highlighting the arrangement of the garden.  A small bench crafted from pale ivory is set within a recessed niche amid the green hedge walls, the flickering flame within the wrought-iron lamps flanking it casting a rippling amber glow across its surface."
