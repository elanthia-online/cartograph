    "A collection of bright candles dominates the room, flooding it with light that reflects off of the flecks of gold within the marble floors.  A carved mahogany desk rests near one wall, while a four poster bed of the same wood is half-hidden by a white spidersilk canopy.  Above the door a message has been engraved in the marble."
