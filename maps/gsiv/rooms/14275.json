  "description": [
    "The cries of the merchants hawking their wares in the South Market are distant here, echoing about the area in strange patterns of sound.  A huge pier juts out into the sea to the northwest, the large roofs of warehouses built upon it looming up into the sky.  A dilapidated archway stretches across the entrance to a winding street to the east, its pathways clouded by darkness.",
    "The cries of merchants hawking their wares in the South Market are distant here, echoing about the area like faint memories of sound.  A dilapidated archway stretches across the entrance to a winding street to the east, the path beyond occluded by an oppressive shroud of darkness.  Opposite it, a dark alley snakes behind a ramshackle warehouse, the cobblestones littered with broken glass and refuse."
