    "The creek has eroded the rise which stretches to the east, undercutting the bank and casting itself in its shadow.  There seems to be no safe path to the water's edge from here, as only the roots of long-dead trees hold the overhanging earth together.  The trail dips to the southwest and allows a nearer approach to the creek.",
