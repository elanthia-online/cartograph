  "description": [
    "A lake touches the edge of the walk, extending into a shadowy pool rippled by concentric wavelets prompted by drops of moisture falling back into the arms of their origin.  A rim of jumbled rock forms a frame around the lake, and lights cast by braziers on its opposite shore send reflections dancing across the dynamic surface."
