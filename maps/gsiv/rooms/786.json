    "You stub your toe on a raised vein of mithril that runs diagonally across the floor of the tunnel.  Rather than exploiting the find, the tunnelers simply exposed the metal so that its beauty might be admired.  Thick ropy coils of mithril reflect the negligible ambient light with a faint silvery tinge."
