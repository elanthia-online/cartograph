    "Within the tent, the air is warm and humid, and the fragrances of all types of flowers assail the senses.  Rows of buckets hold flowers of every shape and hue, each stem carefully trimmed and stripped of any sharp thorns.  The ground is littered with fallen petals, making a colorful carpet to walk upon."
