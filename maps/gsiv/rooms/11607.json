  "description": [
    "Moonlight filters into the tunnel from a small opening to the west.  Some steps, made of wide planks of wood set into the dirt, lead upward into the darkness.  A trickle of water runs down the steps and out the small tunnel entrance.  The smell of saltwater and the sound of crashing waves fills the tunnel."
