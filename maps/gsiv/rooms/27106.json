    "A dense haze of mist permeates the area with its ethereal, smoky presence.  Cool, damp breeze infused into the climate by the rushing water of the river provides a welcome respite from the humidity of the jungle as the thick vegetation surrenders to the rise of the mountain in the north.  Glimpses of the foothills are obscured within the foggy surroundings, with only the thinning plant-life to indicate the change in terrain."
