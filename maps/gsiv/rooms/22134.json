  "description": [
    "Sunlight streams into the small study from a broad window centered in the west wall, which provides a breathtaking view of Solhaven Bay only partially obscured by a low-hanging swag of artfully draped linen.  Lofted on spiral-carved legs, a narrow burled maple desk is positioned against one wall, while a low bookshelf of carved cedar rests against the wall opposite.  Tucked into one corner of the chamber is a pale rose velvet armchair, a braided spring green wool rug stretched out before it."
