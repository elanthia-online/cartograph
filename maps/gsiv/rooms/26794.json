  "description": [
    "Overlapping rugs cover the floor, and sheer drapery canopies overhead flow down the walls in an ethereal haze.  Large cushions are arranged around a small, round table holding a softly glowing orb.  Above a carved stone fireplace that dominates one wall hangs a silver-gilt painting.  In one far corner, a silver scythe encased in a crystal sphere rests atop a stone pedestal.  A faewood curio cabinet's paned glass reflects the ambient light off tiny crystals strung among the canopy overhead."
