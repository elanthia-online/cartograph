    "Marble walls with thick gold veins snake their way through the crystallized rock that sparkles every so often.  Save for a lone ladder-backed chair in the far corner and a sapphire blue banner with the words, \"Knowledge is the key to eternity\" embroidered in white thread, the vast chamber is bare of furnishings.  Brilliantly colored floor terrazzo come together to form a breathtaking image of a drake in flight.  Sunlight falls from the opened entryway causing some of the tiles to glow softly.",
