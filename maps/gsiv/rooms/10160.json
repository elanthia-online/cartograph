    "The brush and other undergrowth here is quite dense as the pass dodges around outcroppings of lichen-covered granite and marble, tiny lizards darting over their mottled surfaces.  Off to one side are the ruins of a farmhouse, its crumbling stone walls not much more than piles edging a charred foundation."
