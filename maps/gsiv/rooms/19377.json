    "Surrounded by polished railings, the small dock is comprised of whitewashed floorboards and is occupied by a lanky and tanned sailor.  Benches provide a convenient place to rest, while colorful umbrellas stand open and offer protection against the heat of the day.  Ascending to the pier, a pair of smooth wooden steps slips through an arch and is anchored in place by large black iron nails.",
