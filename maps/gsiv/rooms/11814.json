    "The road runs west and east, paralleling a huge mud mound.  To the west the road ends at the edge of a sucking, bubbling swamp.  The swamp has engulfed the road, submerging the stones and rendering passage impossible.  Eastward the road appears to be in much better shape.  Humidity and rank odors rise liberally from the muck, and strange gurglings, growlings and squealings emanate from deep within the swamp grass, the area's only vegetation."
