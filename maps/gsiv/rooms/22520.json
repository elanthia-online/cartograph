    "Dim lighting and an attempt at cleanliness cannot hide that the beer hall has seen better days.  The floor slopes gently away from the entrance towards an obviously well-used dance floor.  A bank of polished copper taps lines the wall behind a freshly lacquered ebonwood bar, and new glassware sits upon a single shelf.  A refreshment table with frothy cold brew sits right to the side of the bar."
