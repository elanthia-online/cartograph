  "description": [
    "A pair of Hendoran soldiers stand at attention on either side of a black iron portcullis which leads outside the outpost.  Beyond them, the courtyard fills a space between the outer wooden wall and an inner wall made of stone, where a fortified keep rises behind it.  Above, imperial soldiers slowly walk the parapet of the outer wall, their eyes focused on the horizon."
