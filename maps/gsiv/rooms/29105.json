  "description": [
    "Ebbing and flowing, the lapping waves darken the glistening sands as they soak the edges of a beach illuminated by bamboo torches.  Rough stone stairs rise to the northwest providing access to the road above, each smooth stone step cut directly into the cliff face, which gradually descends into dunes to the southeast.  Set back from the water, an enormous circular pedestal supports a large dolphin statue, the back of which is illuminated from light that spills out of a stone-lined angular archway built into the bluff."
