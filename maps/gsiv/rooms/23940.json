    "Huge cauldrons of vinegar and spices bubble fitfully here and there beneath the canopy of this tent, the smell and heat enough to bring a tear to the eye and sweat to the brow.  Closer to the front, display tables laden with jars, dishes, and a long segmented platter of food are carefully arranged and support a wide variety of treats upon which one might nibble.  Alongside the offerings is a hastily written sign."
