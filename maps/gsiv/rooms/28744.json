    "A long wooden table with benches dominates the center of the space, the clutter of meals and snacks past strewn around it haphazardly.  Shelves have been carved into the cavern walls around the perimeter, stocked with various foodstuffs and supplies, rendering the air thick with the mingled odors of various spices.  A rhimar chest sits against one wall with a handwritten sign just above it."
