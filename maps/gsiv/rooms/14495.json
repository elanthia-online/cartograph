    "Wide skylights let sunlight into the room, giving it a strong, natural illumination.  Built into the walls are numerous small terrariums, their clear glass sides flush with the wooden surface that surrounds them.  A wide variety of little reptiles and amphibians fill the enclosures, milling about or warming themselves on heated rocks."
