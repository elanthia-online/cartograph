  "description": [
    "The rock walls close in tightly, constricting the space to a mere thirty yards or so as the canyon snakes up to the northeast and down to the southwest.  Several large boulders have fallen from the mountainsides, imbedding in the snow and providing excellent places for predators to hide.  Small pikas scramble over one of the boulders, chittering noisily at your approach, then racing down the side of the boulder to find safety in their burrows."
