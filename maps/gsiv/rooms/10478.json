  "description": [
    "The remnants of an old graveled road lead out of the heart of the overgrown fields of wild grass and begin a slow ascent up the side of a gently sloping hill.  A large wooden gate, its iron hinges broken and rusted so that it hangs at an uneven tilt, stands across the remaining roadway."
