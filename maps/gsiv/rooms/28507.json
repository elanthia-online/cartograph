    "Rocky outcroppings rise before a narrow trail that ascends to the courtyard above, the water-smoothed faces of each housing fitfully burning candles that are losing the battle against staving off the gloom and mists that haunt this land.  Tall and dark, an enormous cocobolo tree dominates the grassy area forcing the trail to split and circumvent its looping roots.  The thick haze and salty air have turned the greenery sallow, which in turn creates the cloying scent of rot and stagnation."
