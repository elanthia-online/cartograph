    "Rounding a bend created by a lichen-covered outcrop of granite, the trail crosses a small creek running through a fern-bordered streambed.  The sound of the water is a peaceful background to the melody of frogs and crickets hidden in the shadows.  Following the gentle incline of the forest floor, the creek disappears into the undergrowth of ferns and piles of rock that escort it on its way.",
