  "description": [
    "A massive fir has been split down the middle by a lightning strike some years ago.  Though nearly split to its roots, the fir has somehow managed to cling to life.  Its two halves grow apart from each other as if they were different trees, the details of the damage that split them apart obscured by ice and time."
