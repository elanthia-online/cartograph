  "description": [
    "A long ebonwood table spreads from one end of the room to the other, its surface decorated with silver candelabras and other assorted finery.  Many matching chairs are lined up in precise order along the table, with the largest being at the northern end -- a deep crimson ruby set atop its spired back like a crown.  Intertwined threads of painted ivy run along the walls in fanciful patterns, coalescing above a pair of large glass doors that lead outside to a cozy patio."
