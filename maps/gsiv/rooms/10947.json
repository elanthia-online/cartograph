    "This room is a jumble of wooden crates, rolled-up mattresses, bins of arrow shafts, and other supplies necessary for withstanding a siege.  Numerous arrow loops allow the light to stream in.  A wooden stairway leading down follows the curve of the wall.  At the top of the stairway is a rope, which hangs from a narrow trapdoor in the ceiling."
