  "description": [
    "Filtered through the smoked glass skylight above, the sunlight illuminating the spacious chapel falls in mournful hues that contrast with the painted riot of colors adorning the muraled walls. Extending from the floor to the ceiling of the northern wall is a silver plate that brightly reflects the form of the sword-cloven stone cenotaph below it."
