    "Plush carpeting, dim lighting, and a low ceiling create an atmosphere of cozy sophistication.  A dark leather couch and a pair of wingback chairs cluster together to allow for intimate conversations away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the riverboat.  Rosewood and mahogany doors are barely visible along the tapestry-covered walls."
