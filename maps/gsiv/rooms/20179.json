    "Dark mahogany covers the walls and floors of this well-crafted wagon.  Several shelves hang against one wall, their surfaces padded with rich ebon velvet.  A pair of etched glass cases is centered in the room upon a thick fur carpet.  Suspended from the ceiling are several glaes lanterns, their light casting a pale glow over the area.  A silver-framed sign hangs next to a thick wooden door banded with strips of hammered copper."
