    "Dull dark mahogany panels the entryway of the establishment, the wood probably once rich but now dusty and unpolished.  Plain egg-and-dart wainscotting adds some definition and design to the otherwise boring walls, splintering in several spots where it remains intact.  A flight of crooked wooden stairs leads up to a small landing, and double-width lintelled doors brace the hallway on each side.  Paralleling the staircase is a narrow corridor leading toward the kitchen."
