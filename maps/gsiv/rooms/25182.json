  "description": [
    "Accompanied by the subtle scent of lemon oil, the burgundy-draped hall is attended by a dozen neatly arranged round oaken tables.  Matching chairs surround each one, providing comfortable seating from which to observe a raised maple stage at the west end of the hall.  Dulcet lighting emanates from four sets of candelabra suspended from the dome ceiling, casting soft shadows on the pale gold carpet.  A modest selection of refreshments rests upon a hazelwood sidetable."
