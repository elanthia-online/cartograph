    "Stretched along the bank, a large hoarbeam building dominates the river's edge.  Amaranth, pansies, and fire lilies fill the beds to each side of its fel door, while swathes of wisteria festoon its beams and lintels.  Bending down to greet their cousins, baskets of ivy and petunias overflow on windowsills.  Boisterous conversation carries from the terrace to the river side of the building."
