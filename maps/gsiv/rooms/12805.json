    "Bare of any papers, a plain oak desk is positioned diagonal to an unadorned high-backed chair behind it.  Other chairs line the northern and eastern wall nearest the desk where long bulletin boards are lined with neat rows of tasks to be completed.  A large armoire and armor stand are set side by side upon the western wall beneath a worn coat-of-arms banner."
