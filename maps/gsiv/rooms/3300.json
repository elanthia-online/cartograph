    "A crackling fire greets you as you wander into a large room filled with crates of dried meats and kegs of some unknown liquid.  A small table is set just on the far side of the fire with a cloth covering and several chair around it.  A second table on this side of the fire has no chairs but has an odd knife and small bowls of oregano and dillweed arranged on it."
