    "Small, dislodged rocks careen quickly down the side of the cliff, giving indication of what might happen should a misstep occur.  The night sky is filled with radiant moons and glittering stars in all except a few spots far to the west.  A few hardy weeds have taken up residence in the soil of a nearby crevice, but no insects clamber over or around them, and the silence is only disturbed by your own movements.",

A few fluffy clouds drift in the blue sky far to the west, but otherwise the day is clear and bright.  A few hardy weeds have taken up residence in the soil of a nearby crevice, but no insects clamber over or around them, and the silence is only disturbed by your own movements."
