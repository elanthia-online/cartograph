  "description": [
    "No light of sun or star reaches this chamber deep within the heart of the glacier.  Three oil lamps hang from the ceiling, lighting a room clad in various colors of granite.  Radiating out from the center of the floor in a pattern reminiscent of the nautilus shell are widening bands of white, black, and silvery-grey stone.  The white granite leads up a well-lit stairway to the north, while the black stone descends a dark stairway to the south.  The grey leads through the east wall into the shadows beyond."
