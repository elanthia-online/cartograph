    "An elevated stone dais rests in the center of the chamber, a single step leading up to its platform.  A masterfully crafted oblong-shaped altar made from pure gold and inlaid with pale green moonstones dominates the dais.  Three mullein torches in brass holders are placed around the room, creating a network of flickering shadows along the walls.  Heavily embroidered, overstuffed pillows in various shades of blue are scattered across the floor."
