  "description": [
    "Three small wood-framed beds, each draped with a blue and green plaid blanket, are lined up neatly against the far wall.  Blue cotton curtains, slightly frayed at the hems, flutter occasionally with errant breezes wafting through an open window.  A fuzzy stuffed monkey protrudes from an open toy chest, set upon one corner of a tartan plaid carpet."
