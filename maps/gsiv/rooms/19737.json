    "Three stairways lead from this small plateau.  A short stairway leads straight up while a terraced stairway and a winding stairway snake downward.  To the north a retaining wall of heavy white quartz boulders holds back the upper level.  Honeysuckle cascades liberally over the boulders to fill the area with a sweet scent.  At ground level tall beds of snapdragons and gladioluses wave in the sea breeze that gusts in from the waters of the canal visible to the south."
