    "Mushrooms and other less identifiable fungi bloom profusely in the damp bark of the nearby oak trees, feeding off of the rich soil and decaying matter of the forest undergrowth.  Sickly yellow, beige and ochre caps top lolling stems, and the air is sharp with the scent of uninhibited growth.  The fungi seem to cluster in bands around the wide trunks, forming living rings which cling to the damp bark.",
