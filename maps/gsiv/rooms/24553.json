    "Obviously the owner has a sense for the important things in life.  For those who simply want to enjoy the scent of the grass and the feel of the shifting breeze, a large patchwork quilt has been spread over a table, accompanied by a set of low chairs.  Though simple, there is a sense of luxury in enjoying the hushed sounds of birds singing in the oak and the quiet conversation from nearby tables."
