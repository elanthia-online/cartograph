    "Storm grey walls, painted with jagged lightning bolts and ominous dark clouds, are illuminated by diffuse rays of moonlight that saturate the room through frosted glass windows etched with the alchemical symbol for energy.  Stark white tree branches, oddly singed and naked of bark, form wall sconces whose flickering candle flames glitter off gold flecks in the ebon ceramic floor tile.  The musical tinkling of a wind chime can be heard from high above the brushed steel workbench as gentle breezes trickle in from the piazza.",
