    "Storm grey walls, painted with jagged lightning bolts and ominous dark clouds, are illuminated by diffuse rays of moonlight that saturate the room through frosted glass windows etched with the alchemical symbol for energy.

The musical tinkling of a wind chime can be heard from high above the brushed steel workbench as gentle breezes trickle in from the piazza.",
