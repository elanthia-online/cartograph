    "Small intertwined branches make up the walls of this small workshop.  Carved from the stump of a haon tree, a counter sits in the middle of the room, partially covered in woodshavings and cut feathers.  Lining the walls are shelves which hold bows and crossbows, a dark curtain situated between two of them."
