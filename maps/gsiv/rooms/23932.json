    "A huge pane of curved, smooth glass is set into the side of a large hill and overlooks the nearby volcano and landscape.  The night sky is unpolluted by the light of the town, and a vast number of stars are clearly visible.  An oversized bed in silver and black linens, which sits along the natural rock wall opposite the window, is framed by a pair of ebony nightstands.  Above the bed is a detailed painting of Mushroom Island, and vases of fragrant island flowers rest in small stands around the room."
