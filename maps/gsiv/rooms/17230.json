    "The size of the citadel is quite impressive, but not nearly as impressive as the craftsmanship put into the building.  Intricate etchings of mythical beasts adorn the doors, each unique and clearly done by a different hand.  An elven sentry stands nearby, keeping a close eye on those entering and departing the guild."
