    "The aroma of freshly baked bread wafts through this brightly colored kitchen and clusters of seaweed hang from the ceiling.  Bottles of unopened wine line the counters and fill boxes along the walls, each bearing a crest etched into the cork closure.  An open window allows natural lighting to flood the room."
