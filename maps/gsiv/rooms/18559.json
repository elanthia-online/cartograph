    "Off to the west, meadow-like areas stretch toward the horizon, their colorful hues a stark contrast to the fields full of green artichokes that sprout up in the opposite direction.  The dusty path in front of you weaves its way through the vegetables, which grow up in long stalks.  Cut to leave some of the stems intact, the heads have been sliced off of the artichoke stalks."
