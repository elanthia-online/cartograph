    "Herbs of all types and colors are spread before you, sure to delight the most discriminating chefs and empaths, even as they delight the casual visitor to this garden.  Laid out in rectangular beds edged by walkways, the colors and textures intermingle in a seemingly untamed maze.  Stone benches are spotted throughout the garden, and in the center of the maze of walkways stands a marble statue."
