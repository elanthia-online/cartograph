  "description": [
    "Water tumbles gently out of a brick passage to the north and slowly winds its way across rounded rocks and into a lake to the southeast.  From the smell of things, the lake is a bit cleaner than the sewage water pouring out of the northern passage.  Occasional splashes and gurgling noises echo throughout the chamber."
