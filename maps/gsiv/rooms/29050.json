  "description": [
    "Verdant green foliage and thick underbrush stand-off against boulders and rough dirt as the animal track slips through the area on its way to the nearby road.  Thick-bladed grass struggles for purchase on the southern edge, while its cousins to the north grow unhindered within the shelter of the Weald's trees."
