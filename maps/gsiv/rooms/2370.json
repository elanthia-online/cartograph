    "Behind a tall, mithril gate lies a flagstone path that winds past a small stream as it moves in the direction of a stately fieldstone building at the opposite end of the estate.  Dark robed figures move purposefully in and out of the building, or wander the grounds in silent contemplation, at all hours of the day and night."
