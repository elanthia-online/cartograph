    "A massive silver-framed mirror dominates the southern wall of this small cozy room, the reflections across its surface twisting and writhing into smoke-like forms.  A large pillow is centered in the middle of the room, sized to accommodate a single person and placed directly in front of a small knee-high table.  Cushions are casually placed around the room to be easily moved for comfort and conversation."
