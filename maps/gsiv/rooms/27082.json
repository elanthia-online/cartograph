  "description": [
    "Towering over the surrounding area, exposed roots heavily clogged with moss and clumps of soil dominate the landscape where a forest titan has crashed to the ground.  Smaller saplings, bent and bowed by the girth of the arboreal giant, show the recovery of youth as new limbs and leaves begin to grow.  Spotted mushrooms find purchase in the sheltering shadows amid the rot and decay, their caps moist yet powdery."
