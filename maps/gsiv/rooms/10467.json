    "The sweet, dry fragrance of freshly cut wood permeates the air in this spacious area, combining comfortably with the smell of the various oils used to protect and waterproof different types of wood.  Spread across the floor and proudly propped against specialized standing racks are sections of interlocking wall samples that can be found in the many shops in this area."
