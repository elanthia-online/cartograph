  "description": [
    "Stretched between two poles is a large woven hammock, which dominates one corner of the small room.  A table is placed to one side and a chest is pushed underneath, material showing from inside the partially closed lid.  Swaying from side to side as the ship rolls with the smallest disturbance of the water, a simple lantern lights the cramped space.  Hung with a striped blanket, a narrow archway leads deeper into the quarters in one direction while a small doorway gives access in another."
