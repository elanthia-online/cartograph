    "A portable forge depicting the pantheon of Liabo, Lornon, and Neutral dieties of Elanthia sits in the center of the room.  A work bench is off to one side with forging tools and oils, while a trough is set up near the forge.  Bits of dried seaweed and molluscs are only stuck on a few rocks and in crevices on the ground as if someone had tried to clean most of it up."
