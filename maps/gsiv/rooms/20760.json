    "The area is lit by panoramic windows that take up the top half of the exterior walls, while the bottom is paneled in a cherry oak that lends warmth to the room.  The paneling is broken only by a carved cherry oak door and a rounded black oak archway, as well as several ensconced lanterns.  At one side of the room, an expansive wooden bar holds a variety of concoctions, and behind it a colorful banner hangs on the wall.  Scattered around a plush forest green carpet are tables and chairs stained a slightly lighter shade than the paneling."
