    "Crafted of sturdy canvas with solid oak supports, this back corner of the tent is partially obscured from the main area by numerous swathes of knotwork-patterned linen.  Dusty and dark, the corner's only accoutrements are a simple bedroll and a small fel trunk with a candle perched on its flat lid."
