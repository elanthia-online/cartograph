    "Structures of stone and glass spread out to the north and east.  Grey granite walls support arching glass domes that reflect the sunlight brilliantly.  Several chimneys belch steam into the frosty air to create a dense fog over the entire area.  A silver-framed glass door beckons from the first granite building to the west while a small iron door in the marble wall to the east allows exit to the streets of Icemule Trace.  Save for a small sign on the wall, this area is barren.",
