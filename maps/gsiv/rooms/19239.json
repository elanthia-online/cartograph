  "description": [
    "The acre of lawn extends both north and west, bordered by tall thick hedges with southern, southeastern, and eastern exits.  Chestnut and walnut trees shade several sections of the area.  Quiet instruction, often punctuated by the ring of metal on metal, takes place under several trees, with the focus appearing to be the improvement of physical and combat abilities.  In contrast to the rounded deciduous trees, two upright sugar pines stand near the western hedge, with a long table under each pine."
