    "The long, narrow building has an open floorplan, though a demi-wall, fashioned as an elongated ogee arch, separates the space into two chambers.  On the left side, a suite of chairs is arranged in a quatrefoil formation, forming a sitting area, and on the right side, sets of shelves display basic lasts and examples of custom pieces.  A mirror surrounds a small platform set in one corner and a gold-gilt door is set in another."
