  "description": [
    "Cracked foundations are all that remain of single-room homes that once stood upon this sandy shore.  Splintered, warped, and shattered floorboards fill the rough square shapes, though the wooden lengths are waterlogged and riddled with barnacles.  To the northwest, large poles hint that a pier may once have stood there, but the timbers that allowed passage and access long ago rotted away."
