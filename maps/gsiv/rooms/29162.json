  "description": [
    "Stacked crates, each stamped with a kraken crest, line the northeastern edge of the wooden pier, while off-white lead lines stretch between painted horn cleats and a quintet of tie pilings on the opposite side.  Dark blue lacquer forms a huge diamond in the center of the walking space, the translucent finish forming a protective barrier over the bright white message at its center proclaiming \"Pier 5 - Slips 11-15.\"  From somewhere above, the piteous cry of a seagull fills the air."
