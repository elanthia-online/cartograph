    "A low murmuring, like the sound of whispering voices, fills the room.  A slowly twirling globe lantern hangs mysteriously overhead, its violet tint creating a variety of odd shape-shifting shadows against the walls and floor.  Creeping, finger-like tendrils of a fine mist rise slowly upwards, slightly obscuring vision.  An abstract noise, very much like the sound of something ripping, grows increasingly perceptible, drowning out the whispering."
