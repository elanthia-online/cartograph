    "Brimming with bottles, canisters, jars, and containers of all sizes, rows of thick shelving nearly obscure the pale white paneling on every wall of this small cubicle.  A rectangular worktable occupies the center of the room, making maneuvering difficult.  Assorted mortar and pestle sets, clean and ready for use, are scattered amidst miscellaneous glassware and other equipment atop the table."
