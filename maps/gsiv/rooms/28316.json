    "Built near the city's high walls is a pale grey stone enclosure with a carved mistwood gate.  Inside the fence is a courtyard leading up to a white-paneled cottage.  Barely visible above the top of the crenellated facade are the windows and high turrets of BriarStone Keep, its lapis-tiled roofs glinting in the moonlight.  Winding away from the the postern gate is a small trail that travels towards the mountains."
