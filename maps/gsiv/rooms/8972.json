    "Low lighting produces deep shadows in the interior of this massive tent.  A few unsavory halflings loiter in the corners, sharing a bit of gossip or handicapping the next race.  One side of the tent is dominated by a wall of multicolored crates, while wooden benches of various heights line the other side.  At the center of the tent is a large model of the city of Icemule Trace."
