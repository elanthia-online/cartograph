  "description": [
    "Hummingbird Pond's north bank is lush with flowers and ferns.  A large blackberry bush sits right next to the water, its surface covered with a shifting, fluttering cloud of butterflies.  Honey bees visiting the thick patches of clover growing around the prickly bush provide a constant hum."
