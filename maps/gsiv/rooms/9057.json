    "A small crystal chandelier with candle-filled globes hangs from the ceiling, its illumination softly spreading across the exposed oak paneling of the room.  A long lacquered oak counter sits to the north, its surface cleaned off and ready for tomorrow's rush of daily book returns.  The area is silent as most of the patrons have left for the night.",
    "A small crystal chandelier with candle-filled globes hangs from the ceiling and exposed oak paneling spreads throughout the room.  A long lacquered oak counter sits to the north, its surface littered with dozens of books and volumes of various sorts.  A group of scholars stand off to the side, their voices lowered as they enjoy a hearty debate about something."
