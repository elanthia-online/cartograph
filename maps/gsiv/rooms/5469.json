    "The fire-blackened and half-toppled walls of a courtyard surround what must once have been either a cider mill or a roadside inn.  Charred skeletons of fruit trees stand in ordered rows outside the fallen walls, while shattered roof beams protrude from the ash-choked pit that was the building's cellar."
