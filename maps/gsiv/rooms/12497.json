    "The broad sweep of the cherrywood floor is interrupted by a withered yellowing plant.  Halfway to the polished haon ceiling, an antique wall hanging hangs on one of the smooth sandstone walls.  A long mistwood counter and a painted red cedar rack are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
