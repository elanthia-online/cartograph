    "The glacier continues its relentless descent from northeast to southwest, fueled by the constant supply of snow from the mountainsides.  The snow slides down, piling high on top of the glacier and turning the lower levels of snow into ice.  This ice, in turn, becomes part of the glacier, and the combined weight forces the entire ice mass downward to the southwest in a slow, imperceptible, grinding movement."
