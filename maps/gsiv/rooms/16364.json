    "The broad sweep of the sea glass floor is interrupted by a leaping dolphin statuette.  Halfway to the skylight-set ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls.  A shell-lined bamboo counter and a floral-etched ceramic case are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
