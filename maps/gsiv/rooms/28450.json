  "description": [
    "This chamber is clearly set up to facilitate dancing.  A large expanse of the floor is perfectly smooth stone, reflecting the light of the many torches along the walls.  Off to one side is a raised stage littered with musical instruments of various shapes and sizes.  Small circular tables with tall metal chairs are interspersed around the perimeter of the dance floor, and a small alcove near the entrance has some refreshments for sale."
