  "description": [
    "Brightly painted wooden posts and multicolored checkered tablecloths help to diminish the murky darkness created by the thick cloud of tobacco smoke hanging in the air.  Several tables are pushed in the corners beneath the eaves of the thatched grass roof, and grimy metal signs are nailed to each wall.  A trio of wax-covered empty bottles rest on the sill of the open window, each glass holding a half-melted candle."
