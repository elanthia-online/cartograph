    "This part of the hallway is narrower than the main hall, and the regularly spaced columns discontinue.  Massive flagstones of somber colors floor the hallway.  At intervals along the heavy stone walls are ancient suits of armor interspersed with paintings of famous battles along with portraits of mighty Warriors of renown from many nations and times.  A wide staircase leads up, while narrow stone steps lead into the basement."
