    "Protected on three sides by high, rocky protrusions, the beach has brilliant white sands that fall away from surf that gently laps at the shore.  Several white wooden beach chairs are scattered across the area and positioned to face the swimming area.  A white picket fence stretches along the edges of the area creating a barrier between the garden, which can be accessed by a white picket gate, and the recreational area."
