    "Stone steps lead upward to the parapet of the outerwall along the perimeter of the courtyard.  A stone trough placed next to the steps is filled to the brim with tepid and foul-smelling rain water, and home to numerous insects which dart across the water's surface.  Set next to the trough is a rotting wooden bucket, set on its side and slowly collapsing inward on itself under the stress and decay of time."
