  "description": [
    "Along the eastern border of the garden, creeping vines have forced their way through a snow-laden wall, the frozen tendrils not quite reaching a series of winterberry bushes glistening in a sheen of hoarfrost.  A maze of crystalline ice sculptures and dark shrubbery is embraced overhead by delicate crystal arches draped with curtains of iceblossoms and snow pansies.  Cutting through, a winding cobblestone pathway leads to a raised center dominated by a large bonfire encircled by cedar log benches."
