  "description": [
    "Banners of vivid crimson silk span the gaps between the pristine, fluted white columns, and the hall ends abruptly in small, round chamber.  A small, flawless altar rises from the unadorned floor, its base wrought with bold silver knotwork.  Behind the altar is a cyclopean statue of a heavily-muscled man, his fluid stance a masterful depiction of his competence in combat."
