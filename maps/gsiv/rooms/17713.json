    "Two skeletons lie just inside the doorway to the cell, overspill from the violence that had occured outside in the corridor.  Beyond the two remains, the cell is mainly empty, with just a few patches of musty hay spread haphazardly around the floor.  Four chains with manacles are attached to the wall just below a small carving in the stone."
