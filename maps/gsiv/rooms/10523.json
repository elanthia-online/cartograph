    "A patch of loose powdery soil produces a low-growing creeping plant that dominates a dead tupelo tree as it twines itself up the length of the trunk.  Moonlight illuminates the surface of the water and reveals an abundance of featherfoils.  Dark pink petals that have fallen from the canes of a swamp rose bush, littering the surface of the water.",
    "A ray of sunlight strikes the water, revealing colonies of leptothrix as they float serenely by.  Littering the surface of the water are dark pink petals that have fallen from the canes of a swamp rose bush.  Low-growing creeping plants dominate a dead tree as it twines itself up the length of the trunk."
