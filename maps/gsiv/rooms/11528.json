    "The path leads between two very tall coral structures that seem to dance with life inside.  Crossed spears have been stuck into the reef above the path, forcing passersby to duck or risk a nasty head wound.  A group of small radiant fish have made a home in this area, and they dart frenetically through the submerged passage."
