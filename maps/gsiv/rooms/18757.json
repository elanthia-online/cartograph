    "Frescoes in a healing motif cast moonlit shadows over the foyer's pale limestone walls.  Semicircular in nature, the foyer boasts a slightly domed ceiling and two large glaesine skylights.  Small beds and tubs of healing herbs and flowers touched by starlight line the pale wood floor, and a large vine-limned archway leads west to a hallway.",

Small beds and tubs of healing herbs and flowers line the pale wood floor, basking in the sun's light, and a large vine-limned archway leads west to a hallway."
