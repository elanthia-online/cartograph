  "description": [
    "A niche in the cliffs shelters a sloping field of scattered rocks and dry brush.  Grasses rustle in the constant wind sweeping in from the bay, and seabirds soar overhead, their plaintive cries echoing from the cliffs.  A steep trail winds up the cliffside between the rocks."
