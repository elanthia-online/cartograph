    "Swathes of ink black chiffon cascade from polished brass rods to drape over each wall.  Silvery pinpoints of crystal glitter on the ceiling in a display of constellations, each one winking in and out as flickering brass sconces illuminate the area.  A broad ivory rug cradles a trio of onyx cases as the centerpiece of the room."
