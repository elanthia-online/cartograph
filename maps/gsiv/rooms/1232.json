    "A huge tree, perhaps twenty-five feet in diameter, has fallen onto the path, blocking further progress.  The tree trunk is heavily covered with dark green moss and brownish yellow fungus, and the overhead canopy shows no sign of a break in the tightly woven umbrella, indicating the fallen tree has lain here for some time.  Brackish water pools underneath the trunk, adding to the steamy mist.  The narrow path continues off to the north."
