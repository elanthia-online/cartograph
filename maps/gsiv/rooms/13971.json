    "A break in the trees to the northeast offers a view of the waterfall cascading over the rocks and into the clear, aquamarine water of the lake.  Cottages stand along the path, turned to take advantage of the lake's panorama.  Ferns grow right up to the doors of the homes in thick masses, surrounding them with a verdant carpet and framing the paths which give them egress."
