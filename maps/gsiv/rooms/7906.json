    "The tiny boat is beached on the shore, but the waves and tide still reach beyond its bow.  As the waves break behind you, the dinghy rocks slightly and shifts in the swirling, bubbling sand.  Finding no oars on board, you are thankful that the dinghy is anchored with a rope tied around a large rock on the beach."
