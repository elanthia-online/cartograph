    "The plain ends a short distance to the north in the dark shape of an even higher and more desolate plateau, its heights shrouded in an ethereal mist that seems to gather and flow in the chill wind to swirl around your feet.  Several faint rectangular depressions dimple the cold ground, arranged in a row like ancient graves but unmarked by any stone."
