  "description": [
    "An uneven layer of hay covers most of the loft, with pale splotches of mold forming a second, less wholesome layer.  Here and there the hay slopes downward into a soft-edged hole where the floor boards have rotted away beneath it, and elsewhere the hay is striped with accumulated pigeon droppings beneath the roof beams.  An old modwir ladder leans against the edge of the loft and provides an easy means of reaching the ground."
