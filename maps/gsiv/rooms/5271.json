    "The path comes to the edge of a ravine to the west before turning away to the north and southeast here.  The ravine is currently dry, but looks as if it might fill in a heavy rain.  Small trees and light brush dot the banks of the dry river bed.  The path crumbles underfoot very close to the banks."
