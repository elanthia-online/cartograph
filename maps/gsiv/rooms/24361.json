    "Softly lit by beeswax candles, the room is comfortably crammed with books.  Several bookcases stand at the back of the room, all of them filled almost to the point of bursting.  Reading tables are arranged around the space, some covered with stacks of books and scrolls.  Several potted plants lend a bit of atmosphere to the room and also help to brighten it up a bit."
