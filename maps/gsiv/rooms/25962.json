    "Small tables and chairs are scattered about a quaint portico area that shelters in the shade of the rampart wall.  Several scholars sit around the tables arguing in a friendly manner, while some sit by themselves with papers spread before them.  A long counter resting near the wall is stocked with rolls of parchment, ink sticks and other sundries, indicating that this area is frequently used by the studious."
