    "Warm winds sweep over the battlement overlooking the northern half of the Citadel complex, offering a bird's eye view to the disrepair and destruction visited upon the fortress over the centuries.  A steel bucket sits by the wall, filled with rusted metal arrow heads interspersed with faded fletchings."
