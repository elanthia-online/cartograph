    "Spacious and practical, the windowless room is illuminated by a myriad of candles resting upon tiered felwood shelving.  A large circular table dominates the center of the room and is surrounded by high-backed wooden chairs.  Light flickers on the plush plum carpeting and is reflected onto a comfy bed, nestled against paneled maple walls.  A glass-fronted solid oak dresser occupies the space beneath one of the shelves."
