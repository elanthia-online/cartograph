    "The light bounces in from the wider caverns, forming merry colored patterns everywhere you look.  A shifting sands mural has been skillfully rendered upon the walls, adding cheery atmosphere.  The floor is simply a collection of perfectly flat pillars of rock that seem to grow up from the endless abyss of deep water around you.  Although there seems to be no heat source, the temperature of the rocks is consistent and comfortable."
