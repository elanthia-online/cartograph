    "The north wall intersects with the west, forming a sharp corner which the footpath wraps around to disappear to the south.  A field of old, rotting stumps surrounds the area near the corner, indicating that once a sizable grove of trees stood nearby before being chopped down for security.  Animal paths run in and around the stumps before running up and merging into the footpath by the wall."
