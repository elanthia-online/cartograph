    "The once elegant dining room is strewn with shattered crystal and pottery.  The sideboard has been tipped over, two of its legs snapped off.  A large waraxe is imbedded into the center of the table, its wood splintered and covered with dust.  Sunlight glints off a shard of glass beneath a broken window.",
