    "Massive ironwood doors, flanked by brass torches, guard the entrance to the keep, which could provide a defensible position for a last stand if the outer walls were breached.  Softening the look of the building itself are stands of amaranth and dragonstalk that have been planted along the walls of the keep.  An arched gateway stands on the east, guarding a curving path that follows the inside boundary of the rampart wall.",
