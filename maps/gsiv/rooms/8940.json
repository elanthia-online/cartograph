    "Cold wisps of wind pass through the observatory, causing your breath to fog and swirl before you.  The town of Icemule Trace spreads out to the south, while the mass of Aenatumgana obscures the lowermost portion of the northern sky.  A solid zorchar rod covered in frost extends upward, reaching for the sky.  Star charts heavily inked with notes plaster every available surface, and an impressive brass telescope occupies a central dais.",
