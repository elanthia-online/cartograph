    "Two large wagons parked side-by-side dominate this area, with oversized hoops that stretch the crimson canvas into a common roof for both.  The sound of laughter, loud voices and the clink of glass on glass coming from within make a sign unnecessary.  The stairs leading up to the wagon's door look wider and sturdier than those of the neighboring wagons."
