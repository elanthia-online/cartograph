    "The golden statue of a stately drake dominates the room.  Crouched on all fours, the drake's long neck curves like a wave to leave the beast's head looking down over the room.  Elaborately formed candlestick holders rise up to each side of the drake's head, their candles burning near the eyes.  A tall counter runs the length of the room opposite the statue."
