    "Painted an eggshell white as a base, an elaborate mural encompasses the entirety of the wall space to the east, west, north, and south.  Centered in the floor is a large golden puma statue that rests on a shiny, black marble pedestal.  In the middle of the room, near the statue, a gold-lettered plaque rests on a black marble podium, describing the scenes in the room."
