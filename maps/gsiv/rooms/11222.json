    "The hair on the back of your neck rises slightly, as this room appears to have been only recently vacated.  Although sparsely furnished, everything here is intact.  A low pallet covered by a rough wool blanket sits in the far corner, while a plain chair stands guard beside a tall lacquered wardrobe.  A tin of armor polish and a whetstone lie on the nightstand, as though awaiting their owner's return."
