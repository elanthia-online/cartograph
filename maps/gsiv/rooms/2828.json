    "Rocks are tumbled in a precarious course that makes crossing them a demanding pursuit.  Patches of snow dot the crevices between the granite, studded here and there with small, brightly leafed bushes.  North of the field of stones, spruce and pine begin to grow, looming out of the river's fog like spectres."
