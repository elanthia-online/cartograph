    "A three foot high railing encloses a wide, cedar porch which has aged to a warm red tone.  Several rocking chairs are arranged near a small wicker table.  Through the trees, in the distance, snow-capped mountains can be seen rising through a fog.  A spiral staircase, following the contour of the tree, descends back to the forest floor, while a heavy oak door provides access to a cottage built around the tree.  A tall window provides a glimpse of the interior of a cottage"
