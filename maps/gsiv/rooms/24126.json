    "Twin sputtering torches provide just enough illumination to make out a figure on the eastern wall.  Hanging by his manacled hands is the decomposing body of a young male gnome.  Several stab wounds are visible on his chest and blood stains his dark robes.  A narrow ledge can be seen along the western wall."
