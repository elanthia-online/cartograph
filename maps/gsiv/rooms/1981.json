    "The most noticeable feature of the room is the massive dome overhead.  The tall domed ceiling apexes at a grey crystal set into the roof.  Two pillars help to support the dome while a band of silver, interrupted by raised rune designs, encircles the base of the dome.  A small window allows a view of the nocturnal world outside while the light from the crystal tints the room to a light shade of grey.  A simple blue rug rings the perimeter of the room.",
