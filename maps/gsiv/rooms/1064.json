    "Small tunnels no larger than a human's thigh lead underneath the massive boulder to the west.  The tunnels are certainly much too small for any person to use, as if one would really want to clamber down into the cold, moist earth here.  Occasionally a pointed, whiskered snout protrudes out from one of the tunnels, followed by a pair of squinting green eyes.  The animal pauses, surveying the area, then retreats into the tunnel again accompanied by a loud chittering."
