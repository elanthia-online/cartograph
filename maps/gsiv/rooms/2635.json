  "description": [
    "This part of the cavern seems intimate after the expansiveness just around a bend of the red stone.  Recesses all along the east wall give the rock a filigreed appearance which belies the vast size of each enclosure.  The fine sand is a constant carpet, however, the light it expends is much dimmer here, fading to a soft twilight within the eastern niches.  To the south, the walls swirl to create an oval passageway into another cavern where more of the recesses can be glimpsed."
