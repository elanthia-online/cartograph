    "[Aspen Forest, Ancient Path]"

  "description": [
    "With a floor of frost-covered leaves several lengths deep, this forested area looks like it has not been disturbed for years untold.  Mighty aspens cover the mist-shrouded land, their trunks stretching high overhead.  Scarcely a breath of wind is detectable though small patches of sunlight dance upon the scene, bespeaking powerful winds near the tree tops.  A winding furrow creasing the fallen leaves suggests an ancient path, long unused, may lay below."
