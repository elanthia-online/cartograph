    "Bootlegger's Alley comes to an end at a cul-de-sac, sheltered by the wind by walls on two sides and the back sides of the shops of Tavern Burrow on the third.  Bright sunlight streams down, highlighting the odd bits of trash that collect along with leaves and snow in the corners of the walls.",
