    "The broad sweep of the celadon marble floor is interrupted by an ornate bottled ship.  Halfway to the modwir plank ceiling, an elaborate glowbark-framed portrait hangs on one of the polished oak walls.  A book-laden wyrwood-inlaid desk with a brass-framed glowing white orb on one side is pushed to the back of the shop."
