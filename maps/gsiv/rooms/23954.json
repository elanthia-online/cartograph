  "description": [
    "Heavy lengths of dark green velvet drape from the oaken supports of the peaked roof overhead to enclose this small area.  Glass-bowled lanterns are situated around the perimeter to provide adequate illumination, though the flames behind the glass seem to burn of their own accord with no oil visible in the bowls beneath.  Centered on the back wall of the tent is a slotted parchment display shelf with a massive half-skull bowl set atop it, while the heart of the space is occupied by a sturdy oaken pedestal.  A simple brass hook is affixed to the side of the shelf."
