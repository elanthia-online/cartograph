    "This room is fashioned as something of a circular deck, with a wide hole cleaving out much of the middle of the floor and leaving walking space only nearer the walls.  Through the open portion of the floor, metal rods rise and fall in constant motion, pushing several huge gears.  Those gears in turn power other rods and smaller gears, some connecting to the causeways which slide animated figures out onto the display platform of the tower, some powering the actual workings of the timepiece."
