    "A truncated set of steps rises into the seclusion of this tower, which is ringed by stone benches and a trio of lancet windows that look out onto the sea.  In the center of the floor is a shallow pit heaped with a rounded pile of glowing embers, which impart a subtle warmth to the surrounding stone.  At the fringes of the smoldering heap are half-burned bundles of herbs and flowers."
