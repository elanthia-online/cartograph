    "Four squat pillars of immense girth ring this cruciform room, their undressed stonework appearing all rougher by the harsh, flickering light cast from the great iron-shod torches mounted there.  A large, rough-hewn boss is centered amid the heavy vaultwork, surrounded by strongly patterned mosaics.  A rood screen, crafted from closely spaced vaalorn spears amid twining mistwood branches, spans the gap between the two eastern pillars."
