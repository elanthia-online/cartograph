    "To this room of pale, aged oak, warriors who've fought in lands near and afar have turned here between wars to hone their blades, heal themselves, and prepare for that to come.  Near the door stands an ash armor rack and a haon map cabinet marked with a gryphon.  A fel bureau and desk rest opposite a large oaken bed piled high with blankets.  One wall holds a marble bookcase, and the other, a noble tapestry.  Some cat fur lies on a pillow and two bowls occupy a corner."
