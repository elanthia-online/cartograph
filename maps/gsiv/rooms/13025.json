  "description": [
    "This once impressive dining hall is capped by a towering arched ceiling that rises a full twenty feet overhead.  Attached to the ceiling by thin tendrils of rope are hundreds of assorted skulls that are surrounding a badly chipped crystal chandelier.  A second chandelier has fallen and smashed into the huge banquet table in the center of this room."
