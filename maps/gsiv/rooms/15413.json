    "A simple fauna tapestry hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a mistwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  Some potted luminescent toadstools sits in one corner of an unfinished wooden floor.  There is a gilded maple table on one side of the shop and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on the other."
