    "One mildewed and moth-eaten bedroll is the lone remnant of furnishings in this ramshackle hut.  Animal droppings litter the floor, and tufts of fur and feathers billow lightly with each incoming breeze.  Several fluffy bits of multicolored fur and a few downy feathers have been utilized for a collection of rodent nests along the back wall."
