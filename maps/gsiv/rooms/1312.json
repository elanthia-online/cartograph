    "Northward, the land is a patchwork of dark green forests and golden fields, and beyond it the sea stretches like grey-green slate to the horizon.  In the opposite direction, a grass covered plateau is bordered to the south by a line of blunt, snow-covered peaks.  Crossing Zeltoph's flank, the trail begins its descent to the grassland."
