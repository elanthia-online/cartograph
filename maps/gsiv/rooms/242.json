    "This dingy street is overshadowed by two multi-storied buildings.  At the far end is the unpretentious facade of Beldrin's Gaming Hall, from which the harsh shouts of gamblers, touts, and onlookers echo into the street.  Across the way is a local inn, frequented by sailors, dockworkers and fishermen, from the looks of the clientele gathered around the doorway."
