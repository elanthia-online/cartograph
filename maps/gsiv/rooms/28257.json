    "Its entrance jealously guarded by a small, unadorned door of blond wood, the cozy audience chamber's ceiling is obscured by drapes of carmine velvet that form an inverted dome over a a gold-bordered circular linden table.  Standing at the center of the room, the table is ringed by six oaken chairs.  A golden marble fireplace with two plush seats before it dominates the breadth of the southern wall, fed by sticks held by an adorned brass basket."
