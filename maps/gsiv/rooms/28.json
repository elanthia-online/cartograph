  "description": [
    "A low grey stone wall provides a backdrop for several flowering trees, each sending a small shower of petals tumbling towards the ground with each stir of the night breeze.  The court is relatively quiet, as a few shoppers visit merchants and a single group of travellers chat amongst themselves.  Warm amber light shines from the northeast and the glowing glaesine windows of the imposing Shimmarglin Inn.",
    "A low grey stone wall provides a backdrop for several flowering trees, each sending a small shower of petals tumbling towards the ground with each stir of the day's breeze.  The court is bustling with activity as shoppers visit merchants and groups of travellers chat amongst themselves.  Much of the pedestrian traffic flows to the northeast towards the imposing Shimmarglin Inn.",
    "A colonnade frames this section of the Court, attached to the portico of a low-slung white marble building.  Access to the porch is blocked, however, by a pair of tables, each covered for the night with a white tarpaulin.  Overhead, the slowly spinning bulk of the dais looms.",
    "A colonnade frames this section of the Court, attached to the portico of a low-slung white marble building.  Access to the porch is blocked, however, by the mass of stalls and tables set up in front of it.  A wide path winds through the confusion, unobstructed, but by no means straight or direct.  Overhead, the slowly spinning bulk of the dais casts a shadow below."
