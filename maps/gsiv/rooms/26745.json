  "description": [
    "Affording a spectacular view of the mist-filled darkness outside, the cavern wall falls away on one side of an upward slope, completely open to the elements and a precipitous drop-off.  The opposite wall expands outward, allowing ample room for the wares draped from multiple hooks and placed atop a long driftwood table.  Shoved against the walls are substantial piles of dead kelp, which exude the stench of rotting sea life.  Almost indiscernible in a shadowed niche, a warped door bears deep gashes."
