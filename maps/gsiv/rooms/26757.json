    "In the hue of a flawless sapphire, the walls are textured beneath the paint, with barely visible spirals traversing their lengths like coiling breezes frozen in time.  Tiny flames dance above the wicks of the azure candles perched on the many-armed silver sconces that dot the perimeter of the chamber, and in each of the four corners is an elemental orb nestled in a mithglin cradle.  Within the orbs, sands shift, water burbles, fire hisses, and air gusts with haunting howls."
