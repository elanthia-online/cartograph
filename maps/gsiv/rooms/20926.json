    "The salty smell of the sea perfumes the air, indicating the likely proximity of the ocean.  However, giant cedars stand sentinel around the perimeter here, effectively blocking any view of the nearby waters.  The trees lend their own pungent aroma to the briny tang of the air.  Small white flowers grow in delicate sprigs on many branches, while the mostly unripe fruit pods attract the occasional group of macaws to feed."
