    "The Borthuum Company Store towers over you, a massive block of solid stone.  Its windowless bulk is broken only by a wide set of mithril double-doors.  Dwarves and other folk crowd through, many carrying sacks or bags.  Beyond the store to the west, a heavily laden cog sits low in the water of the River Muagh."
