    "A tropical bloom wreath hangs on one of the hung silk walls, and a silk-covered ceiling rises overhead.  A bird of paradise-filled vase sits in one corner of a thickly carpeted floor.  There is a silk-covered dress mannequin on one side of the shop and an elegant silver jewelry rack on the other."
