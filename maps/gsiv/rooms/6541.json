    "Moonlight spills across the floor, the dust motes swirling in the beams as they lance through the windows and door.  The walls on either side are compartmented, with cubbyholes the length of a man.  Much of the wood has rotted, making each platform a precarious place to put any substantial weight.  By the looks of the accumulated detritus, it appears that many smaller animals have made their homes here.  A mass writhes above, the darkness hiding all but the motion and rustling sound of bats.",
