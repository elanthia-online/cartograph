  "description": [
    "Upon the moss-covered limestone walls, shallow niches house a number of sarcophagi.  Iron sconces give off a pale green illumination, giving the hall an eerie presence.  Smeared trails of blood and gore lead in every direction.  Lengths of tattered cloth are scattered across the floor."
