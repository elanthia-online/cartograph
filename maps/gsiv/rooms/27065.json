  "description": [
    "Thickly gnarled, the buttressed roots of beech trees pull open the dark earth to create a deep wound that is filled with pits and crags.  Moss clings to the damp ground, its feathery extensions rustling in the ambient breeze, while pale mint-hued lichen clings to the cracked rocks of an old mining site.  Ragged scars, left behind by pickaxes and other mining tools, dimple the rocks and seem almost insignificant compared to the greater destruction unleashed by the forces of nature."
