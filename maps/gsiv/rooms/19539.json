    "A splendid ring of windows around this spire affords a panoramic view of the hall, inner courtyard, and bustling var below.  This cozy aerie has been decorated with a neatly kept desk and distinctly elven furnishings.  Spaced intermittently around the desk are fanciful crystal sculptures, sparkling in the sunlight.",
