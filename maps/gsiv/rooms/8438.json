  "description": [
    "The path winds through a tumble of boulders, jagged rocks ranging between the size of your fist and the size of the Moot Hall in Wehnimer's.  Your range of vision is limited to the next rock, and the trail beneath your feet -- the boulders cut off any sight of the mountain or the slopes, or, in places, even the sky."
