    "The cobblestone road rolls off to the north and climbs the hillside to the west.  A wide causeway branches off to the southeast, its surface paved with huge, flat stones.  An occasional pine rises to the sky, but for the most part the area is dominated by spreading oaks and a species of low, thorny shrub.  The density of the shrubs and the sharpness of their serrated leaves are usually convincing enough to keep travelers from wandering off the marked paths."
