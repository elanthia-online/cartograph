    "Painted white plaster walls rise from a white limestone floor.  Just above a tropical floral arrangement hangs a silken sea-themed tapestry, and a domed white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  A heavy white granite counter and a floral-etched ceramic case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
