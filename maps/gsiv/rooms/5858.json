    "The path rises to the south as it climbs a verdant knoll.  Sunlight streams down upon two large, identical headstones which provide a backdrop for a pair of pewter grave markers inset in the ground, in what appears to be a family plot.  A marble and pewter plaque has been placed in the center of the four markers.",
