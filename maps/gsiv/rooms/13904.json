    "Dark blue textured canvas walls rise from an ash grey granite floor.  Just above a worn rug hangs a fused sun and moon wall-hanging, and a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling completes the picture.  A white marble shelf and a spacious grey slate counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
