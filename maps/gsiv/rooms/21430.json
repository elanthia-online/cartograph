    "Warped modwir boards, which form the walls of this rickety old shack, bend and crack eerily.  Freshly disturbed, packed brownish-red dirt forms an uneven, makeshift flooring.  A pile of torn fabric rests in the far corner of the shack, a piece of which somewhat resembles the face of a smiling feline."
