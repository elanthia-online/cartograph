    "Makeshift walls have been erected inside the tent and laid with spools of soft, colorful fabric to help hide their appearance.  A fine selection of musical instruments hangs upon the walls as well as on the numerous display cases that sit atop slender marble and granite columns.  A young elven clerk sits upon a stool in one corner, occasionally tuning the strings of a lute."
