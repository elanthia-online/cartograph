  "description": [
    "Lending their croaks to the other sounds of the forest, a chorus of bullfrogs rises from a small pond that can be barely glimpsed through the trees along the northern edge of the path.  An enormous tree lies on top of a stone bench, neatly snapping it in half and scarring its own bark in the process."
