    "A round granite boulder sits square in the center of the path near the top of the hill, the blocky carvings inscribed on its surface half worn away by exposure.  Further up the hill to the east, a black obelisk thrusts up against the night sky beside the bulk of a great circular tower.  The worn track spirals downhill to the northwest through pools of shadow along a steep fall of stones imbedded in the hillside.",
