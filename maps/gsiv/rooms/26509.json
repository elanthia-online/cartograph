    "Several tenacious vines have taken hold in the uneven rock.  Moonlight highlights the rugged surfaces with its shadowy cracks and crevices, and they faintly resemble faces, their visages twisted as if trapped in eternal agony within the stone.  Three pairs of blinking eyes wink in and out of existence along the northern slope in the distance.",
    "Several tenacious vines have taken hold in the uneven rock with its shadowy cracks and crevices.  Looking beyond the foliage, the rugged surfaces faintly resemble faces, their visages twisted as if trapped in eternal agony within the stone.  The remainder of the northern slope continuing into the distance is obscured by swirling silvery-grey fog."
