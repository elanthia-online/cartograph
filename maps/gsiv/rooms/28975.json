    "A single brass lantern sways gently on its chain as it hangs from a low ceiling painted to resemble a cloudy sky.  Centered on a rustic orange rug covering the splintered hardwood floor is a pedestal carved into a spiral leading up to an oversized clam shell.  An oak planter nestled within a cluster of twisted bamboo stands off-kilter near the entry, with one side noticeably shorter than the other."
