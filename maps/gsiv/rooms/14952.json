    "Prairie grass nourishes the rolton grazing across the expanse of green.  The herds stretch to the horizon, moving across the meadowlands in wandering, wooly clumps.  The prevalent white of the fleeces is dotted with black specimens here and there.  Cabins dot the countryside, spaced generously apart as if grateful for the ample province."
