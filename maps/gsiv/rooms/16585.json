  "description": [
    "Battered wooden walls rise from a wide-plank oak floor heavily stained with salt.  Just above a skeletal siren lizard attached to the wall by a long rusty chain hangs a wrought-iron key ring, and an exposed oak rafter ceiling completes the picture.  A iron-banded treasure chest with a smashed lock and a bulging sack obscured under a loose plank stand side by side in the middle of the room."
