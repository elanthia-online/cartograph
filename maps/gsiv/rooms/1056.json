  "description": [
    "Lights flicker and move to the west and southwest. Further investigation of this phenomenon is prevented by the tightly interwoven forest, in which poplars and birches stand sentinel before massive oaks and spreading maples.  Under the deciduous canopy, holly bushes happily entreat travelers to try to move through their razor-sharp leaves and offer bright, poisonous berries to the unwary.  The trail follows a north-south orientation here, with the forest to the west and the moor to the east."
