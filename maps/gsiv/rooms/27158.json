    "[Lair of the Ophidian Cabal]"

  "description": [
    "Three corners of the root cellar are fitted with yawning archways that lead deeper into the lair, while the fourth is filled with a rough pine staircase that disappears into the oak-raftered ceiling.  Caged torches are bolted to the nondescript walls and cast their flickering light upon a large round table in the heart of the room.  A gnarled ebonwood quarterstaff is mounted perpendicular to the floor and has a simple blue flag draping from its length."
