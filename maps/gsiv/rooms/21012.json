    "The quiet hoots of nocturnal birds as they occupy the branches overhead echo against the sound of the river to the southwest.  Rustling leaves herald the presence of the numerous inhabitants of the jungle, and the brightly hued forms of nighttime flowers dotting the landscape contrast strikingly with the deep green of the trees.  The shade of the canopy further enhances the shadows of the area as moonlight barely filters through the leaves to illuminate the humid environment."
