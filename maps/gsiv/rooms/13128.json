    "Towering granite shelves have been carved into the library's very walls, lined with ancient texts and tomes in meticulous order.  Smaller receptacles occupy the interior area, with plush runners outlining the paths between and dulling the sound of footsteps.  Arranged in perfect circles around glaes-topped tables are stout leather armchairs, able to accommodate wizards of all girths."
