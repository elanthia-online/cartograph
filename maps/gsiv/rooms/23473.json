  "description": [
    "Dark oak planks, stained by years of rough use and seawater, form the bulkheads and decking of this small cabin.  In a vain attempt to brighten the place up, an expanse of cream-colored silk has been draped across the stern bulkhead.  A set of rough modwir shelves against the forward bulkhead, a brass hat stand beside the cabin door, and a long wooden rack standing in front of the draped silk hold a neatly arranged variety of garments more commonly seen near the Sea of Fire."
