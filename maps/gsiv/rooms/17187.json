    "Numerous weapons, most in pristine, gleaming condition have been affixed to the walls of this vast chamber, creating an atmosphere of utmost warrior pride.  A deep sense of camaraderie is apparent in the various groups that sit and stand about, animatedly discussing topics with varying levels of enthusiasm.  A massive stone fireplace dominates the far wall, its crackling and popping sounds adding a subtle touch of relaxation among all present."
