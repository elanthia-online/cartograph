    "Dark grey granite pilasters, each set with a silver sconce, offset the concave foyer with its richly stained villswood doors from the rest of the atelier.  Clerestory rayonnant rose windows brightly illuminate the room and its three galleries, each recess framed with crimson curtains.  A lightly raised barbed trefoil dais of silver-blue granite showcases a glass-domed black pedestal at its center, while pale hide backstools are arranged on the lobes.  Between the north and east exhibits rests a pair of bleached haon credenzas on either side of a beechwood door.",
    "Two dark grey granite pilasters, partially set into the ivory stucco walls, offset the rounded foyer and its richly stained villswood doors from the rest of the atelier.  Strapwork silver niello sconces alight three recessed galleries on display in the hall, each alcove drawn with plush crimson curtains.  Several pale hide backstools line the room, leaving empty the barbed trefoil dais of silver-blue granite and its glass-domed black pedestal in the center.  A pair of bleached haon credenzas on either side of a beechwood door are set along the northeast wall."
