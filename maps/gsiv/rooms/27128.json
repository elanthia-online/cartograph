    "The constant presence of the jungle serves as a dark and foreboding backdrop to the beauty of the coastline.  Foam crests upon the wet sand, and shallow gullies are left in the wake of ocean water as it ebbs from the shore, only to fill with water when the tide comes back in.  Decaying driftwood clutters the beach randomly, with spindly seaweed tendrils clinging to the water-swollen debris.  A salty ocean breeze permeates the air, while the cries of seagulls join the lapping sounds of the water."
