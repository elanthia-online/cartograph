    "Upriver, the sandstone walls of the Stepfalls Gorge frame the tumbling waters of the Cairnfang, but the river quiets as it leaves the gorge behind and broadens.  Only two of the ancient stone cairns can be seen from here: one is barely visible amidst the white water at the bottom of the gorge, while the other stands almost straight out in the middle of the river."
