  "description": [
    "The crowded alley is filled with clashing currents of pedestrians, flowing in both directions.  Here and there, handcarts disrupt the traffic, causing eddies and halts.  The cobblestone thoroughfare is remarkably busy, considering its narrow confines and crazy zigzagging route.   Overhead, the upper stories of buildings shade the street, their windows closed off by ornately carved wooden latticework which protects the inhabitants from the sight of strangers."
