  "description": [
    "A gentle rise in the landscape toward the north has allowed most of the standing water to drain, leaving large stretches of semi-dry earth.  A partially decomposed rodent corpse stretches out from one patch of mud, the forelegs reaching as if the unfortunate animal died in a vain attempt to claw free.  A large swarm of flies buzzes around the corpse, continuing the cycle of life."
