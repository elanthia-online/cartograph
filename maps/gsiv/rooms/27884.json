    "A midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the polished oak walls, and a varnished golden oak ceiling rises overhead.  A brilliant red hibiscus plant sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a floral-etched ceramic case on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
