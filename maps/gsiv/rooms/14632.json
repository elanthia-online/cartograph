    "A huge, elaborate wooden carving of a peacefully sleeping dragon stretches on the shelf behind the long, brass-railed bar from one end to the other, dominating the room.  The pub is all dark wood and polished brass fixtures, and the cozy booths are upholstered in well-worn red leather that must have once been luxurious."
