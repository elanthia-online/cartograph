    "The kitchen is aglow in a haze of orange light as the fires from the two large stoves in the back burn bright, their flames slow roasting the boars and quail turning on their spits.  A trio of curly-haired halflings shuffles back and forth between the cooking fires and some low countertops, feverishly preparing the next meal.  Above a stout wooden table, a long oak cabinet holds a range of bottles, cups and other refreshments."
