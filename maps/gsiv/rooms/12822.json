  "description": [
    "Thick ledgers in orderly rows fill bookshelves along all four walls.  Several chairs are set against one wall for those waiting to rest their bones.  A counter splits the office in two, separating the waiting area from the registration enclosure.  A large desk sits in the middle of the enclosure with an elderly clerk ensconced behind it.  A sign is posted on the counter."
