  "description": [
    "Less than a foot past the entryway, the silvery stone comprising the embassy's exterior gives way to polished white marble shot through with veins of sparkling gold and blood-red corundum.  Mirroring bas-reliefs gleam from either wall, taking the forms of twin sunbursts on lacquered crimson fields.  Overhead, a chandelier set with shards of Mandis crystal and countless flickering candles shines down upon the the gold-fringed burgundy carpeting cutting a swathe northward."
