  "description": [
    "The passage of time has eaten away at the finish of a pair of scarred double doors, revealing silvery, splintered wood beneath.  Framed by the curve of a wrought iron banister, the balcony is bare of adornments, but echoes of rich hue and make in the carpeting allude to past finery.  The balcony overlooks an antechamber with a checkerboard floor of black and white marble that is in comparable disrepair.  Each descending stairway is crumbling and caked in dust."
