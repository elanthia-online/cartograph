    "At this junction of the dizzy flight of steps, the way splits.  To the northeast, the steps continue to climb toward a platform cut into the cliff wall.  This appears to be an entrance into a large dwelling perched atop the ramparts.  To the south, the steps pass over a chasm between the cliff face and a beautiful building constructed on the pillar rising from the foot of the precipice.",

This appears to be an entrance into a large dwelling perched atop the ramparts.  To the south, the steps pass over a chasm between the cliff face and a beautiful building constructed on the pillar rising from the darkness of the canyon floor.  Torches stuck into gouges in the wall offer enough light to make a fairly safe climb."
