    "Darkened sea caves rise like crookedly bent fingers from the gleaming waters that surround a wide expanse of mottled phosphorus rock.  Sections of the geographical lacework brood overhead, the arcing stippled curvatures touched with sheer moonbeams in their circular hollows.  Opaque silver-grey fog clings in heavy bands about the ridge, slowly drifting outward to the rippling ocean.",
