  "description": [
    "Flanked by cork buoys, a large sign with blocky letters directs foot traffic to the southwest, while a painted blue arrow upon the floorboards of the pier curves to the southeast.  Large and small boulders prevent ships from drawing closer to the eastern edge of the pier, though five tie-pilings to the south provide ample space and depth of water to prevent damage to docking vessels.  A pile of neatly coiled rope rests at the ready next to a series of iron horn cleats."
