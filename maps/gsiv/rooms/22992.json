    "The bustling workroom takes up a larger portion of the tent than appears from the salesroom.  Multiple workstations are set up around the edge of the room to make wares for customers.  More organized than the front room except for several columns of cauldrons, a simple workstation has been set apart from the others in an area with space for a small audience.  A large mithril pipe extending through the ceiling provides ventilation to the room, and a small opening leads back to the salesroom."
