    "The ruddy crimson light emanating from a lava pocket covered by a circle of glaes bathes the golden anvil that serves as an altar in a glow not unlike that of a forge.  Cast in heavy iron, a statue of a thickly muscled man wearing a leather apron stands behind the anvil, his right hand holding a huge hammer ready to strike an unseen slab of metal.  The dark red light from the lava below plays across the statue's gleaming surface, illuminating the man's determined and headstrong expression."
