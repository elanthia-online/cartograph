  "description": [
    "Originally designed for feasting, the hall has been turned into a room of experimentation, with two large examination tables set side by side and encircled by countertops bristling with lab equipment and arcane instruments.  Layers of dust cover everything, broken only by tracks leading back and forth across the floor.  High above, a candelabra hangs from a vaulted ceiling, rimmed with the melted remnants of dozens of candles."
