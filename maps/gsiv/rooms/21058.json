    "Towering over the area, a huge brush box tree creates a stunning green canopy dotted with snowy white flowers.  The flaring buttress arches up, creating a tunnel large enough to walk through.  Circling the base of the tree, several bird's nest ferns proudly display their yellow-green fronds, which fan over the sparse vegetation that carpets the moist forest floor."
