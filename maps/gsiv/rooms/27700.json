    "A breath of iceblossom and white tea mingles with the permeating cedar walls of the rounded room.  Sunlight washes over the room through a large bay window fixed with snowflake-stitched curtains pulled back on either side to frame the deeply inset cushion-strewn bench beneath.  A burnished antique desk and an ivory-stitched suede chair have been positioned so the warmth of a stone fireplace radiates toward them from behind.  Atop the frosted glass mantel is a striking portrait nestled in an arrangement of moonflowers."
