    "Enclosed by curving paneled dark mahogany walls, the room features a velvet-lined glass display case resting on a dusty thick wool rug at the center of its dark oak floor.  Evenly spaced tall carved maoral bookcases ring the room, various detailed taspestries hanging between each at regular intervals.  Faintly scented smoke dances among the thick rafters of the mahogany-beamed ceiling."
