    "Graceful pillars enclose this small room, each bearing a long column of shelves between them.  Myriad vials, jars, and canisters line every available inch of shelf space, giving the room a cluttered look despite the obvious care in arrangement.  An elegant marble worktable rests against the far wall, its gleaming surface graced with carefully arranged mortar and pestle sets, each one of them clean and ready for use."
