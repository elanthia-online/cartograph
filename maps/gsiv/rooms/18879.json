    "A tinge of ozone lingers in the air as you look around this dimly lit room.  Scorch marks and rust-colored stains, possibly from experiments gone awry, adorn the area.  Your attention is drawn to a mysterious circle etched into the center of the floor, and your mind whirls as it tries to interpret the significance of the design."
