    "Roughly carved, the cavern is supported by beams of axe-hewn wood set at regular intervals.  A rocky fire pit is centered in the room, with the earthy smoke of burning cave moss rising from it.  Resting on a stone stand, a large wooden keg marked with several dwarven runes is tapped and ready for pulling, and a variety of mugs are piled to one side.  Crates of cooking supplies are stacked between barrels of salt pork and fish, and sacks of grain lie to one side.  Some makeshift stone shelves are carved into the walls, their surfaces covered with foodstuffs."
