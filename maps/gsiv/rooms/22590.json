    "In contrast to the tap room, the dance floor is clearly illuminated by numerous silver lamps evenly spaced along each wall.   A mahogany dance floor covers the entirety of the area and dark scuff marks attest to the use it's seen over the years.  A small wobbly wooden table offers up a refreshing drink to those who have worked up a thirst dancing the day away.  A colorful silk curtain leads into a small recessed room."
