    "An expansive stained-glass window takes up nearly the entire eastern wall, multi-hued facets of light twinkling through its numerous panes.  Banners liberally cover the walls, each trimmed with crimson and gold tassels upon their silken edges.  A massive onyx desk lies in the center of the room, its surface lustrous and obviously well-kept.  The subtlest hint of burning incense drifts through the surroundings."
