    "Elaborately draped counters and richly lined boxes display the jewelry on sale here.  A young woman stands by the counter, keeping a friendly eye on the browsing customers.",
    "Several lengths of velvet draping accent the intricately carved counters of the shop.  A row of golden snowflakes lines the outsides of the jewelry  on display.  Each piece of jewelry inside the cases rests atop small velvet podiums.  Suspended by twisting lengths of silver chain overhead is a small sign.  A young woman stands by the counter, keeping a watchful eye on the browsing customers.",
    "Soft, white velvet fabric has been draped over the tops of various intricately carved counters, creating a bright showroom.  Shimmering silver tinsel snowflakes draw eyes to the glittering wares on display.  Inside a series of carved jewelry cases, small, white podiums exhibit semi-precious gems set in an assortment of earrings, necklaces, and other trinkets.  A lively human clerk keeps a watchful eye on cases and customers alike."
