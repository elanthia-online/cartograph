    "The deep obsidian walls are dominated by the large bas-relief on the wall opposite the door.  Runes surround the huge soaring dragon, covering the black stone about it as if attempting to contain the great drake.  A shattered mirror covers the ceiling, backlit by a mysterious glow.  In each of the corners stands a modwir bookshelf lined with ancient tomes.  A large gold bed occupies the center of the room."
