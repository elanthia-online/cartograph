    "Hung in even rows along the smooth grey stone walls are numerous charts and maps of Elanthia rendered in vivid inks.  In the corner, some potted miniature toadstools sit upon shelves, casting their soft white luminescence over the entire office.  A thick leather-wrapped tome lies open upon a glaes-topped desk abutting the far wall."
