    "Spaced equidistant from each other, fruit-bearing trees pockmark the grassy landscape.  Stepping ladders stand next to the gnarled limbs of the verdant beauties, while baskets rest near their trunks.  Burning torches crafted of bamboo are spread throughout the orchard and are strategically placed to prevent accidental fires."
