    "Floor to ceiling bookshelves of highly polished rowan wood and stacked with ancient tomes line the walls of this room and the balcony above.  Well-lit window seats offer a comfortable place for reading one of the many volumes lining the shelves.  Upon a pedestal in one corner sits an enormous globe, while centered in the room is a massive linden wood table with matching chairs."
