    "An oak-plaqued stuffed trout head hangs on one of the white silk-paneled walls, and a billowing silk ceiling rises overhead.  A well-armed stocky warrior statue sits in one corner of a smooth slate floor.  There is a iron-bound ebonwood chest on one side of the shop and a floral-etched ceramic case on the other."
