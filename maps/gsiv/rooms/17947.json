  "description": [
    "The eastern wall is completely covered with vines.  The sound of running water draws your attention to a fountain, half-concealed behind the vines, thickly coated in soft cushions of moss and algae.  The north wall, once of glass, is now little more than a metal framework with a few glinting shards here and there.  Sounds of activity from the rooms beyond filter out into the courtyard."
