  "description": [
    "An old halfling sits on one of the bunks that take up most of the room in the deckhouse quarters.  His attention is fixed on a piece of wood he's whittling, and he gives interlopers no notice.  Small items of a personal nature are attached to racks above most of the bunks, offering an insight into the sailors who sleep here -- a hat, a couple of carvings relating to favorite gods -- each has a sense of significance, since so little here deviates from uniformity."
