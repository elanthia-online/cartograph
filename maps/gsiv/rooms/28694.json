    "The broad sweep of the blonde oak floor is interrupted by a stuffed grizzly bear.  Halfway to the oak beam ceiling, a dwarven miner portrait hangs on one of the smooth white plaster walls.  A heavy white granite counter and a tall oak and ivory cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
