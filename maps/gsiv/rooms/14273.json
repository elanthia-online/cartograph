    "Tendrils of mist creep along the ground like writhing serpents, cloaking the bits of garbage and other debris scattered across the cobblestones in a hazy veil of grey.  The walls of buildings loom overhead, leaving only a meager slice of pale moonlight to barely illuminate the surroundings.  The street takes an abrupt turn here, the cramped feeling more pronounced in this curved section.",
