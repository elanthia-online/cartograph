    "As your eyes follow the path into the trees you can just barely discern a small cottage nestled snugly among the foliage.  The vegetation grows so close to the building that it seems to be a part of it.  Flowers and vines cover the walls and roof, yet you realize that they grow in such a way that neither the wooden door nor the windows are blocked."
