  "description": [
    "Small and crowded, the alcove has an excellent view of the bar, the ladder, and two of the other three alcoves.  Long-legged chairs, with high backs, surround the polished oak table, which also has incredibly tall legs.  Recessed niches house stubby candles providing enough illumination for the occupants, but not enough for outsiders to be able to identify those gathered."
