  "description": [
    "The forest is absolute, the thick pine trunks crowding close to the path on all sides.  The trees intertwine their heavily needled boughs into impassable walls which support daubs of pristine snow like diamonds upon a finger.  The trail breaks into three directions, each avenue winding away into the forest and soon lost in the thick verdure."
