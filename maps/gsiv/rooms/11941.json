  "description": [
    "Two wide stone platforms, tilted and crumbled, flank the sides of the road.  A huge, obsidian colossus, fashioned in the likeness of a mighty warrior, has toppled from its perch upon the platforms.  It now lies stretched, like an enemy slain in battle, across the river to the east.  One booted obsidian foot touches the bank of the river, heel firmly lodged in a stand of cattails growing at the water's edge."
