    "Festooned with brightly colored banners, pennants and flags, a weathered modwir shed, with very little else attractive about it, still manages to look appealing.  Further west, the row of shops becomes more sparse and the passersby appear to be more interested in simply taking in the Bay beneath the night sky than haggling over goods."
