    "Fine lines of gleaming copper edge a massive refectory table of polished pine.  Arms of golden glaes twist outward from the walls, bearing natural beeswax candles.  The table is surrounded with long, wide benches of earth-colored suede.  At odds with the large size of the room is the cozy atmosphere created by the honey-colored wood beam ceilings and walls covered in smooth umber silk."
