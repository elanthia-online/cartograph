    "The chamber is redolent with the ambiance of history and art.  Its tall, dark wood walls stand guard over two rows of pedestals facing each other, like queues of dancers lined up for a minuet.  On each of the stands rests a musical instrument, obviously all very old and exquisitely crafted.  Sconces are hung, positioned over the instruments and cleverly crafted to cast a soft halo of light around the priceless artifacts they spotlight."
