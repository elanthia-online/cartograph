  "description": [
    "The beach narrows here, disappearing to the west between the bay and the rocks.  A wall of gnarled black lava rises to the south, stretching in a ridgeline to the east and west.  The flowing lava must have extended the land nearly a hundred yards into the bay before it froze into place.  Some day it'll likely have a layer of soil on it, and plants and animals will make their homes there, but for now it's barren and lifeless."
