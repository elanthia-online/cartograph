  "description": [
    "Murky shapes, indistinct in the primeval forest gloom, filter through the swaying pine boughs of the woods surrounding you.  Suspended between two ancient and venerable pines is a large, intricate spider web.  Tattered to shreds and fluttering in the breeze, it appears to have been spun to trap man-sized prey."
