    "Rendered upon all four walls and the ceiling of this cozy bedroom is a panoramic mural painted with fluffy white clouds set against a pale blue background.  Each billowy mass is lightly tinted with a sunset hue of violet, amber, and crimson, their colors intensifying as they descend toward the carpeted floor.  Draping over the four posters of a neatly made bed is a sheer, gauzy canopy, made from the same fine material adorning a pair of frost-paned windows."
