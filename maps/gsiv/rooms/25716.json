  "description": [
    "Vaulted ceilings decorated with swathes of painted silk are arranged to give the impression that the room opens to the sky.  Tropical plants, housed in enormous urns, give the space a natural feel that is reflected in the warm linens that cover the carved golden linden bed.  Candles housed within bird-shaped vessels provide ample illumination from their perch upon the decorative armoires and dressing tables.  Glass-paned doors in the southern wall stand open to the moonlit balcony."
