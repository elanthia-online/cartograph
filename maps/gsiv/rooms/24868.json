    "The broad sweep of the celadon marble floor is interrupted by a pile of striped throw pillows.  Halfway to the golden oak ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the celadon marble walls.  A flexible willow woven basket and an engraved copper bin are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
