  "description": [
    "The expansive study is lined with recessed bookshelves from the floor to the ceiling.  Several sliding ladders provide access to the tall shelves filled with books and scrolls.  A large oak work table occupies the center of the room, scattered with potions and scribble-filled notebooks.  The stars and moon in the night sky provide barely enough light to navigate the room."
