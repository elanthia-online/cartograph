    "Hanging tapestries that decorate the four corners of this room accentuate the vaulted ceiling -- the symbols for fire, earth, air and water are all represented in the various designs.  Jagged burns on the hardwood floor and several fingernail-sized gouges in the near wall offer evidence that suggests a powerful explosion, but from the looks of things it must have happened long ago."
