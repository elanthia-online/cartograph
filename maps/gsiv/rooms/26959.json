  "description": [
    "Brightly glowing globes of frosted glass stand upon high wrought iron pools, the distant spheres dispelling the darkness that wreathes the travertine spire to the north.  Carefully groomed cypress trees, grown incredibly close to the avenue, mimic the shape of the structure and block view of the landscape beyond."
