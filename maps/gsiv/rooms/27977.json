    "Nestled in the cavern wall, the expansive niche is burgeoning with a variety of cave pools, some a pale crystal blue hue, others deep sapphire, and just one a distinctive inky black.  An aven in the high ceiling above leads only to darkness, producing the effect of a vacuous hole above you.  Intermittent dripping sounds provide a staccato rhythm to the soft, constant chorus of sighs that echoes through the area."
