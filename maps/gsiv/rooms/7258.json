    "The foul air from the bog below forms ghostly tendrils of rank-smelling mist that swirl and eddy around the twisted trunks of the ancient yews.  The trees crowd the path, their blackened shapes guarding over several deep pits that look to have been dug up long ago and now lie half-overgrown and filled in with dirt and scrub.  A particularly large excavation lies just north of the path, its near side shaped into a ramp leading into its depth."
