    "Ankle-deep cool, clear water fills the area, lapping lightly at the edge of the basin.  Worked in the same stone as the surrounding basin, an elaborate statue dominates the center of the pool.  The gentle babble of running water disturbs the otherwise quiet and calm nature of this place.  Starlight overhead blankets the night sky.",
