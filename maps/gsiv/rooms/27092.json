    "Thick grass and flourishing plant life provides a lush retreat from the water, the shoreline easily transforming from the water-smoothed stones of the lagoon bed to the rich soil of the jungle floor.  A cool breeze circulating through the area is refreshing, and the canopy of trees provides an additional respite from the heat of the day."
