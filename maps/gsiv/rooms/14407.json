    "The stone walls surrounding this courtyard have been built with numerous small shelves jutting out at various heights, while the center of the courtyard is occupied by a crystal clear pond teeming with a school of brightly colored fish.  A monir-planked catwalk spans the pool, bisecting it and providing ample opportunities for nimble-pawed fishing in the moonlight.",
