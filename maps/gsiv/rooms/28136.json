    "Dense undergrowth gives way to what must have been, at one time, a functioning fire pit.  The fire pit is crude, dug a foot deep and supported by stray stones that seem to have been culled from the forest floor.  A thick ice glazes the fire pit, betraying the fact it hasn't been used in quite some time.  A shortcut through the woods, veering away from the main path, appears possible to the southeast."
