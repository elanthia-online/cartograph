    "The golden blossoms of marigolds and daisies fill the flowerbeds that line the cobblestone lane beneath the filtered shade of linden trees.  Thatched and shingled cottages stand in a row between the trees, and a sweet smell of tarts baking somewhere nearby mingles with the scent of the flowers."
