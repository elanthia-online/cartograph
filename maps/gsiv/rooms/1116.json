    "Crystalline veins in the surrounding rock catch the moonlight and reflect it in varying shades of grey on the stone surfaces.  The quartz deposits appear to be streaked with impurities, rendering them useless for gem cutting.  A buzzard complains loudly, guarding its nest from the approach of strangers.  The protest is needless.  The nest is firmly established on the underside of a long rock outcropping, and it would take special climbing gear just to reach the agitated buzzard.",
