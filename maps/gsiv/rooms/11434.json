    "Four rows of wooden benches sit astride a small aisle, allowing theatre-goers an unobstructed view of the small granite-floored stage.  Limelights are arranged around the base of the stage for use during productions.  Burgundy velvet curtains adorned with golden rope provide an accent to the colorful backdrop depicting a sunny day by a river."
