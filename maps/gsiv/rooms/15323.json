    "Small, stained glass lanterns hang from the corners of the room casting fractured, colorful illumination that washes across the textured stucco walls and sparkles against the painted stucco ceiling like glimpses of distant stars.  A pair of crossed eahnor longswords overlaying a reinforced wooden roundshield has been mounted opposite the entrance to the room, directly above a suit of armor that rests on a large stand atop the polished maple floor.  A glass-inlaid maple counter has been placed against the eastern wall, and some rich maple shelves hang across from it."
