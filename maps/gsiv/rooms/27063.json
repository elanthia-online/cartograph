    "Towering trees and thick, verdant shrubbery crowd together along the shambling path, the arboreal giants casting shadows upon the patchwork ground of moss and clover.  Spindled limbs stretch towards the star-spangled sky above, the dappled leaves filtering the silver light and creating cool motes that sparkle in the air.  Crouching within the foliage of the gigantic hardwoods is a leafy vine-covered arch that is surrounded by the yellow blossoms of wood violets."
