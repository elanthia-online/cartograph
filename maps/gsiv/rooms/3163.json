    "Long dead stalks of sunflowers stand encased in ice looking like the eyestalks of some gigantic creature.  The tall brown grass rustles in the slight breeze releasing a sound like giant scales sliding over the earth.  Small trees rise out of the grass, their stark forms hunched down as if to protect themselves from cold."
