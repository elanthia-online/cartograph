    "The gallery bends at an oak-framed maple door in the eastern wall, continuing to the southeast toward a wide marble-arched opening that leads into a chamber that smells of preservatives and old parchment.  Jewel-toned stained glass panes wink from the windows along the southern wall, letting in sunlight but mostly repelling the draft."
