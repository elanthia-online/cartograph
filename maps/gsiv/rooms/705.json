    "The var snakes gently around a corner, winding its way past the back doors of cottages and shops.  Each doorstep is as neatly kept as the last, swept clean of debris and planted on each side with a stunning variety of flowering plants.  A tavern stands nearby, a mithglin plaque swinging from its doorpost.  Here and there along the var, a window shines in the darkness.",
