    "The broad sweep of the sea glass floor is interrupted by a colorful seashell collection.  Halfway to the skylight-set ceiling, a faded treasure map hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls.  An aqua-hued seaglass display and a warped treasure chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
