    "Lacquered bamboo dyed a warm red hue spreads across the simple patio to create an even floor, while matching poles are laced together on two sides to form narrow privacy walls.  High above, a lattice of woven bamboos creates an open roof that houses hundreds of tiny silver lace vines that create a natural canopy of verdant and white hues.  Painted screens of delicate rice paper frame a glass-paned white birch door that leads into the villa, while smooth round stones lead into the garden beyond.",
