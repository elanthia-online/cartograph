    "Embraced by the mirror-image ascents of two curved stairways, the antechamber is a relic of good taste tarnished by the cruelties of time and abandonment.  The floor is a checkerboard of white and black tiles, though age has riddled both hues with impurities and the stones with spidering cracks.  A tiered golden corona lies, bent and warped, in the shadow of the upper balcony.  Light filtering through mud-caked windows breathes prismatic life into shards of crystal scattered over the tiles."
