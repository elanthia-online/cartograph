    "Tumbled from craggy hillsides now overgrown with trees, chunks of fractured shale and sandstone lie in jagged clumps along the west bank of the river.  A line of smaller rocks leads from the shore to one very large boulder that overlooks a particularly deep and clear section of river where large fish seem content to dwell.  As if to confirm the popularity of the site, fresh bear tracks and a few partially-eaten fish dot the surface of this particularly well-placed rock slab."
