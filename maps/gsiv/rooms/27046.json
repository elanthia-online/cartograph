    "Sunlight slants across the crystal blue waters and brightly illuminates the floor of the watercourse as it makes its way around a small island.  Here and there, guests to the waters ride ferries or pedal boats either further out into the harbor or closer to the docks where others stand waiting.  A lone balloon with string still attached hovers near to the ocean and drifts where the wind wills it."
