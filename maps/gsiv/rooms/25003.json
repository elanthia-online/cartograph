    "Empty kegs of dark ale lay broken on either side of the road, the fermented odor intermingling with the scent of charred flesh.  Tall enamel flagons, strewn amongst the splinters of wood, sit half-filled with ale and blood, the liquid coagulating along each gilded brim.  A small group of maggots squirm amongst the glasses, the insects in turn being greedily devoured by a murder of crows."
