  "description": [
    "To the east, nightmarish trees loom over the fog-enshrouded road, their dead branches reaching out like great skeletal spiders trying to pull in their prey.  The thick, unnatural fog smells faintly of sulfur.  A weathered and faded sign hangs high over the road on a twisted piece of rusted wire."
