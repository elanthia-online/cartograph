    "An eddy has formed in a curve of the creek a short distance before it joins the wide Tempest River.  The bottom of the creek, visible through the clear water, consists of small pebbles that have been washed downstream by the current.  The creek bank, a half moon of brown, blue and green pebbles, is surrounded by tall cattails and reeds.  A small wooden footbridge crosses the creek to the north.  In the middle of the creek is an old pier piling."
