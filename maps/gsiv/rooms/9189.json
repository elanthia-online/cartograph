  "description": [
    "A small protrusion on the outside of the keep provides an ample perch for the small orange bird roosting upon it.  The beak of the animal is nearly as large as its body, and it is rather comical to say the least.  The feathered critter doesn't seem to be terribly concerned with any of the outside noise or distractions."
