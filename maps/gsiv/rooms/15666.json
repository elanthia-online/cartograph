    "Walls of dark granite paneled in white ash encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a yellow sunburst hangs along one wall, opposite a brightly glowing hearth.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the sweet scent of daisy petals rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its bright linen snugly tucked."
