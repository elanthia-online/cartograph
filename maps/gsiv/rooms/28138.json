    "A cluster of fir trees clings for purchase at the edge of a massive rock formation.  Their thick roots grasp the rock's cracks and crags, like fingers clutching a precious jewel.  Though precarious, a climb down the formation appears possible, while an easier path through the woods continues to the northeast."
