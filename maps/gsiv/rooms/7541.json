    "This is the northern end of a long effluent constructed of ancient, moss-encrusted brick.  Pipe openings line the walls everywhere, but only a few have small trickles of brown water pouring out of them.  In the northwestern wall, a circular opening wide enough to crawl through is barred by a heavy iron grate.  At the foot of the grate, on either side, are rotting piles of hay and sawdust, mixed with crumbling material giving off the distinctive aroma of manure."
