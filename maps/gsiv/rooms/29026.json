    "Irregular boulders stab the sky, the water-smoothed stone leaning at angles against a slab of red stone bedrock with banded beige and terra cotta layers.  Quartz and chert pebbles fused within the eroded face of the bedding plane reflect the sunlight, causing dancing lights to flash in the forest that dominates the area beyond the hard-packed dirt road.  A small wooden sign sits beside a series of wrought iron grips that trail across the boulders.",
