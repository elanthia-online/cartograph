    "The branches here have been trained to grow upward and inward, creating a living steeple of limbs and leaves.  In a zig-zag pattern beneath the peak, strings of spherical white paper lanterns dangle, though they are little more than decoration as dappled sunlight spills through the canopy.  A flat, woven basket of vines sits in the cradle of three limbs, and a pair of shelves are formed by densely braided branches.",
