    "The peak of Tower Hill can be clearly seen through an alley to the northwest, and the tall silhouette of its tower looms in darkness and shadow.  Fog and mist swirl menacingly around the base of the hill, however, obscuring much of it from view.  The area is still, and an unusual silence hangs in the air."
