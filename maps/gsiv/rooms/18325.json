    "Shafts of moonlight allow a brief glimpse of cliffs to be visible through the trees as the terrain thins further from the lagoon border.  Fireflies occassionally flit back and forth over the moss and clusters of flowers creating the shoreline, adding their brightly flashing light to the flickering of the torches that flank a large bamboo hut fashioned with a wide counter."
