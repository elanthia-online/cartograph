    "The boulders and their shadows take on strange shapes in the moonlight.  One boulder in particular resembles a giant fish rising up from a surrounding lake of snow.  The wind's action has piled the snow up around the boulder, giving life to the impression that the fish is dragging the ocean's waters up with it as it leaps into the air.  The action is frozen in time and climate, its eventual splash back into the sea left to the imagination.",
