  "description": [
    "Swarms of flies buzz around this wide strip of cleared ground, which is covered with scuffs and tracks of the passing of hundreds of large hounds and their orcish masters.  Rough stakes are pounded into the dirt here and there, some hung with braided leather leashes, though no animals are presently fettered here for training.  An overpowering smell of unwashed dog and excrement fills the air."
