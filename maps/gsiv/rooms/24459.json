    "Long, twisting veins of mithril and rhimar entwine around each other across the circular room's ceiling.  Several rectangular cubbyholes line the walls, each containing an intricately carved ice sculpture within.  Presiding over the center of the office is a large mahogany chair cushioned with rich leather, with an elegant mahogany desk behind it.  Framed with etched rhimar, an oak-bound door leads back out."
