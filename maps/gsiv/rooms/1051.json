    "A long line of mounded dirt appears to the west, causing those who wish to move that direction to follow the trail to the southwest where the mound seems to gradually disappear.  The long line of mounded dirt proceeds miles to the northwest where, on the horizon, a huge mountain of dirt has been pushed up by some inexplicable force.  Grasses have reclaimed the dirt mounds to some extent, although patches of bare dirt are still very much evident."
