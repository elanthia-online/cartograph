    "Inlaid with a spiral of white cobblestones, the street spills through a picket fence into the public library's circular courtyard.  Colorful hibiscus blossoms decorate the slats of the fence, while the sound of a burbling fountain draws attention to the open gate that proudly displays a painted wooden sign."
