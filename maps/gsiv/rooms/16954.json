    "This long stretch of hall bears little more than three rows of towering bookshelves.  A number of staggered breaks in the expanse of book-laden shelves allows one the opportunity to move between rows, and occasionally a half-height bookshelf provides a potential place to rest some tomes.  Small globes of pale golden light hang from the ceiling at regular intervals, casting a soft but even glow throughout the hall."
