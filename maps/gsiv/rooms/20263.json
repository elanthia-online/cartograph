    "The main path widens here as bootprints converge from several points of origin, most showing the direction of travel to be northward towards a large banyan.  A smaller number lead downslope toward the deeper swamp.  The tracks alone would not be disturbing, were it not for the very large, reptilian, claw-tipped tracks overlaying some of the bootprints leading toward the swamp."
