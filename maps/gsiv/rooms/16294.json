    "The Lane widens into an octagonal alcove before angling toward the southwest.  The paving stones are beautifully laid within this circular area, in an interlocking pattern of octagons punctuated with a host of tiny mosaic bees.  In the center of the design sits a larger bee, the queen of the hive."
