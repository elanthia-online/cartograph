    "Out of place in the line of limestone columns, a small rectangular area houses a plastered window that completely obstructs the panoramic views that many of the other windows in the corridor have.  Set within the whitewashed anomaly, a simple pine door is fitted with rose-hued hinges and knob.  Upon the opposite wall, a pair of woven mats rest before twin alcoves that are framed in marble."
