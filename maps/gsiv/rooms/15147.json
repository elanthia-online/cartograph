    "The broad sweep of the celadon marble floor is interrupted by a fishcale blue mermaid figurine.  Halfway to the golden oak ceiling, a rainbow colored flag hangs on one of the celadon marble walls.  A cedar and oak footlocker and a gilded maple cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
