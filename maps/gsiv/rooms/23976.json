    "[Cooper's, Secret Room]"

  "description": [
    "This cool and pleasant room brings a calm smile to your lips.  It bears the clean, comforting scent of freshly worked wood, and the floor is covered with shavings of modwir, cedar, oak.  The walls are formed of long, vertical planks, fastened with pegs to the substructure and joined in a dovetailed, almost seamless fashion.  Great care and skill has gone into making this simple storage space."
