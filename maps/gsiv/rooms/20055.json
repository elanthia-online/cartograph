    "Thick tendrils of moss waft gently from the tree limbs, undulating soundlessly in the day's breeze.  The path widens slightly as it meanders among the ancient maoral, oak, and monir.  Bright patches of sunlight dance across the hard-packed dirt path where it forks, seemingly split by an ancient weeping willow."
