    "[Skald's Nook Table]"

  "description": [
    "Fur-lined chairs encircle a crudely made table that is crafted of roughly hewn wood.  Nicks and gauges are chipped out of the table, and some past patron has left a deer-footed knife deeply imbedded into the unpolished surface.  A narrow, white pillar candle is crammed into the base of a flute, its flicking light reflecting off of the instrument's key pads, and provides a warm illumination for the area."
