  "description": [
    "Archipelagos of rock jut out into the glaciated valley, causing the trail to swing westward around them.  Snowdrifts pile high up against the windward side of these outcroppings, and the tracks of small mammals are readily apparent across the snow.  Sawgrass thrives on the leeward side of these rocks, in the warmer areas, and occasionally a snowshoe rabbit peers out from the sawgrass, its long ears and button nose twitching inquisitively, before it hastily retreats again."
