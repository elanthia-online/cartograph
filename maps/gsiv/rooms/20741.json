  "description": [
    "This spacious room is dominated by several oak-framed divans covered in quilted sepia suede.  Two overstuffed chairs flank a heavy, brass-studded side table under a panoramic curtained window.  The pale yellow walls are painted in a pattern of ochre-colored geckos climbing towards the ceiling, interrupted to the south by a wide oak door.  One delicate gold chandelier hangs from the intersection of two beams of oak underneath exposed rafters."
