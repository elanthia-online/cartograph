    "The street widens, and set before it is a statue of an elf standing slightly askew.  Behind the statue, set between two large brick columns, is a large elevated riverstone slab accompanied by a bench placed directly behind it of the same material.  The yellow sandy composition of the street is sporadically decorated with spots of dark red and black.  Against one of the columns, an old elven pike leans against one of the columns.",
