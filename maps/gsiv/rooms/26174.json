    "Bone white stones dot the area and are all that remain of the cobblestone pathway that once graced this side of the fortress.  Scraggly monkeygrass pushes up the black dirt in tangled knots along the edge of the granite bulwark, their lengths verdant and almost lush in the shade of the cool stone.  A small pool dangles from the crenellation."
