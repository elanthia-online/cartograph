    "The northern wall of this passage boasts a window almost a dozen feet long.  Set high enough that those outside are unable to see in, the window allows generous amounts of sunlight to fall upon the opposite wall, where multitudes of wildflowers occupy a series of deep mahogany planters.  Roses, carnations, and baby's breath mix with tulips and lilies to create a rainbow array of color and fragrance.",
    "The northern wall of this passage boasts a window which is almost a dozen feet long and set high enough that those outside can see nothing but the hallway's ceiling.  The pinpoint twinkle of stars interrupts the otherwise featureless night sky visible through the glass.  Multitudes of wildflowers occupy a series of deep mahogany planters on the opposite wall, waiting for the morning sun and filling the corridor with their sweet fragrance, somewhat cloying in the still night air."
