    "The walls of this small, cramped space are covered with rows of hooks.  Several of the hooks contain cloaks and capes, most likely deposited here by those visiting the monastery.  Several small mud-caked shelves stand near the curtained doorway to the west, a place to store your boots to prevent the mud from being tracked into the halls of the stronghold."
