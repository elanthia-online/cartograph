    "Deep ruts cut through the center of the street as it winds its way to the southeast.  A mishmash of architectural philosophies wage an ongoing battle in the form of different shacks, homes, and buildings constructed on either side of the street in miscellaneous materials.  One large stone house sits in ruins on a lot suffocated by large brambles.  The flow of activity is less than to the north where a large square predominates, but numerous men, women, and children pass up and down the street.",

One large stone house sits in ruins on a lot suffocated by large brambles.  Under the darkness, the street is mainly empty but for the occasional man or woman, in contrast to a busier square to the north."
