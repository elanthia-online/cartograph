    "Thick brambles grow high upon the walls of this, the east, side of Wehnimer's Landing.  Small pieces of cloth (and flesh) still cling to the sharp thorns of these bushes, left behind by those foolish enough to think that they could gain access to the walled town by climbing the prickly vines."
