    "Graceful limestone columns flank the delicate glaesine windows of a nearby shop.  Thick bougainvillea trails from the walls and roof, casting wafting clouds of pink and lavender blossoms across the wey.  A small silver sign is tacked to the establishment's front door.",
    "The limestone columns on the front of the nearby shop have been shattered by an explosion of some kind.  Great chunks of the stone have caved in upon the shop, shattering its windows and blocking the entry.  Nothing remains of the bougainvillea but a few charred vines trapped beneath the rubble.",
    "A fenced courtyard stands next to the var, its mithril gate open to show a neat courtyard beyond.  A group of city guardsmen congregates nearby, torches held high, their eyes scanning the night warily.",
