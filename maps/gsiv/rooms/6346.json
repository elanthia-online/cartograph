    "Amid the cobwebs of this dark and musty storeroom are a number of lockers and cabinets, some secured by large padlocks or ominous runes.  Disorganized piles of equipment lie strewn across shelves and heaped in corners with seemingly little effort given to care or cleanliness.  A free-standing modwir closet, missing its door, holds brooms, some heavy iron dust pans, and other cleaning supplies."
