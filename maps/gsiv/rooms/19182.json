    "A vile conglomeration of dank water and dilute tar coats the wall of the unassuming chamber in the ship's ballast.  Though the floor is marginally dry, the pervasive dampness has soaked into and rotted heaps of old cloth and what appears to have been a collection of old cabbage.  Dim blue light wells up from the ground beneath the mouldering scraps."
