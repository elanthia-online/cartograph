  "description": [
    "Resting on a tiered platform covered in relief work, an impressive altar of mountain-quarried stone stands in the middle of the chamber.  Blue granite spheres sit on each of the main compass points.  Within each banded globe is a flame, constant and resolute.  A vast, carved scroll floats above the altar, offering no clue as to the source of its suspension."
