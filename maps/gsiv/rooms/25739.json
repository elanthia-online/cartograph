  "description": [
    "The blue and green mosaic tiles lining the tub are magnified beneath the water and sparkle as rays of silver moonlight pierce the shallow water.  Wisps of steam rise lazily around you, creating a foggy haze on the cut-crystal spigots and the polished silver spout.  Nothing but the distant sounds of katydids disturbs the quiet in this tropical retreat."
