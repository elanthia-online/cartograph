    "You are standing on a narrow footpath worn into the smooth stone in between the cavern wall and the edge of the dark pool.  As you gaze out over the pool, you notice step-like terraces of slick rock that rise along one wall, creating a multi-layered natural dam.  Water trickles down from level to level, forming a quiet waterfall that pools near your feet."
