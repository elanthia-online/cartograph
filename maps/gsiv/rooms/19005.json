    "A bright white edifice stands in the center of the grassy courtyard.  Thick marble columns support the building's wings that sweep away, out of sight, to encompass the glass-domed center portion, matched by tall junipers that repeat the arc in living green.   Torchlight flickers eerily through the dome from within.  Flames from glistening brass sconces mounted on the fluted marble columns light the crimson, black and silver insignia mounted over a massive door of polished dark walnut.",
