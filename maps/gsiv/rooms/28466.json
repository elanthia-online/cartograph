    "Heavy curtains of pristine black velvet conceal the gold-framed windows of the room, the fabric allowing mere slivers of light to focus upon a thorn-carved ebonwood table set within the middle of the shop.  Set alongside the table is a tall alum-framed mirror, the piece barely illuminated by single twisted obsidian taper."
