    "[A Spacious Tent]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Rich layers of hunter green silk compose the airy walls of the expansive tent.  Several illuminated copper lanterns sit centered on oaken tree stumps, giving off a soft, flickering light throughout the area.  Nestled cozily at the back of the space, a lengthy cushioned bench piled with woven throws and linen pillows provides a resting spot for wandering visitors.  The toasty scent of burning firewood drifts lightly in the air, adding to the comforting warmth of the room."
