    "Thick grass and flourishing plant life provides a lush retreat from the murky water, the shoreline easily transforming from the water-smoothed stones of the lagoon bed to the rich soil of the jungle floor.  The night breeze circulating through the area is refreshing, and the canopy of trees contributes to the shadows inundating the jungle."
