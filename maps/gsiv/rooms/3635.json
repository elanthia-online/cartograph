    "Almost completely shaded from the moonlight by the tall weeping willows that flank the small ivy-covered cottage, only the soft glow from the candlelight in its windows can be seen clearly.  The soothing sound of crickets chirping mixes with the intermittent hoot of a nearby owl.  Dew glistens on the blossoms and shrubs in the small herb garden to the side of the shop.",
    "At the end of Honeysuckle Avenue and nestled cozily between a pair of weeping willows is a handsome cottage overgrown with ivy.  The sweet scent of honeysuckle drifts on the cool breeze that rustles the leaves of the sentinel trees and gives the lane its name.  A small, well-kept garden sits off to one side, guarded by a white picket fence."
