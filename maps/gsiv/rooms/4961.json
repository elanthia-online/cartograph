    "The slope of the path lessens somewhat here, offering a small respite from the difficult ascent.  The air is still and crisp, indicative of the high altitude.  Strangely, there are no signs of snow on the mountainside.  In fact, the only thing of note along the path is its sudden disappearance into a thick silver mist that completely obscures your vision upward.",
    "The slope of the path lessens somewhat here, offering a small respite from the difficult ascent.  The cool night breeze drifts by, bringing a myriad of forest scents with it.  Just above here, the path disappears into a thick silver mist that sparkles in the moonlight."
