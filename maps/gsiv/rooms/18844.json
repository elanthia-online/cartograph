  "description": [
    "Slight whiffs of decay from a ground covering of fallen leaves mingles with the thick scent of green wood, punctuated by the cinnamony spiced aroma of a bay laurel bush.  Birdsong is loud from above, greeted by a softer chorus of crickets hiding in the underleaf.  The earth has been tamped down in a couple of directions, winding off deeper into the forest."
