    "This cozy suite on the port-side of the mid-level deck has large windows with views of the surrounding area and the waters below.  Richly appointed tapestries adorn the walls, and the polished mahogany floor is inlaid with rosewood dice and fortune symbols.  A silk-draped featherbed is on a raised platform near the windows, where it bathes in the rays of daylight."
