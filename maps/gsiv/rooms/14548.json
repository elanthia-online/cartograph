    "The cougar's habitat has been carefully fenced to include a section of a rocky outcropping, a thicket of pine and maoral trees and a wide pond fed by a slow moving river.  Crags in the rock, as well as the broad, spreading branches of the trees give the tawny cougar a variety of perches.  Stalks of fuzzy cattail sprout along the edges of the watercourse."
