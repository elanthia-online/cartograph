    "Multitudinous yierkas fret and hiss from stalls along the walls of the open-air caravansary, a wide enclosure formed by loose trellises of silvered wood and shielded from above by aged canvas.  Standing beside a small fel sign, a tall blond man with a neatly trimmed goatee oversees the chaos, shouting over the cries of animals and customers alike."
