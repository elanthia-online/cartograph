    "The tunnel opens out into a wide room, dimly lit by the flickering light of candles that burn on the dozen small oaken tables that have been set around the room, with a variety of cloth-covered crates and half-barrels serving as chairs.  A private curtained booth and a dark booth are set into one wall, and a long oaken bar runs along the north end of the room."
