  "description": [
    "Oyster mushrooms cover the abundance of rotting, damp leaves carpeting the rich jungle floor.  Spectacular masses of arum lilies cluster on the liana vines twisting their way around the assortment of trees, their tapered, paper-like leaves vividly spotted with alabaster speckles spanning out from dark purple veins.  Moonlight breaks the shadows encasing a fallen log, glistening on accumulated rainwater within its hollow where mosquitoes flit back and forth in a hum of movement."
