  "description": [
    "Paneled mahogany walls rise from a polished oak floor.  Just above a glass-fronted bookcase hangs an ancient River's Rest map, and a sturdy oak-beamed ceiling completes the picture.  A wide brass-handled cabinet and an antique sailor's trunk stand side by side in the middle of the room."
