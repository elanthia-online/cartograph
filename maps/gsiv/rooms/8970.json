  "description": [
    "Leaftoe Lane comes to an abrupt halt at the foot of a row of thin residences.  The granite curb before the dwellings is swept spotless, and brass kick-plates on some of the doors shine cheerfully in the cold grey light.  The eaves of the houses are steeply pitched and their windows are as tall and thin as their silhouettes."
