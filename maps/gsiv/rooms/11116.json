    "Tenuously you cling to the large spar here which extends out from the bow of the ship.  Below you the water from a small river flows past the anchor chain and into the cove with a constant gurgle.  It looks as though the only way to go is back down the bowsprit, but you may be able to climb down the anchor chain with care."
