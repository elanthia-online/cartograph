    "The South Market Pier is visible to the north, its tarred pilings jutting out far into the pristine, sparkling waters that make up Solhaven Bay.  The peaks of small waves roll and crash into one another, creating a small webbing of white, foamy bubbles that spreads across the surface of the waters below.  The large, sharply-peaked roofs of numerous rectangular warehouses loom to the west."
