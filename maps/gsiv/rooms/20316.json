    "In the midst of the bald cypress trees littering the shore and the shallow, murky water, a single, massive buttonwood rises up, its cracked trunk thick, its many bare branches reaching in every direction.  Faint and distant, the sound of slowly dripping water drifts through the swamp.  A young boy sits on a rhimar chest on the bank, his gaze locked on a murky dark pool.",
