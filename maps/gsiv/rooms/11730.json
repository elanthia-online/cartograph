    "Little light enters the cell, creeping in from the hallway outside and revealing only a few feet of a filthy stone floor.  Dirty pieces of hay scattered over the visible surface of the ground intermingles with hundreds of large, roach husks that crunch underfoot.  The sound of skittering feet come from the shadows, sometimes from the blackness where the corners of the room should be, and other times from the walls and the ceiling."
