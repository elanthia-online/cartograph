    "[Savage Storm Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Mismatched chairs have been placed in an uneven circle around the lopsided mahogany table, the surface of which is so uneven, it threatens to spill any drink placed upon its surface.  A large painting covers the surface of this table, depicting, in breathtaking detail, a savage storm decimating the ships anchored in some unknown port city."
