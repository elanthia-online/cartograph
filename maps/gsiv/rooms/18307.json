    "The jungle terrain surrenders to a swampy environment, moonlight dappling the mist with light as the thick, musty decay of leaves and rotting logs grows strong.  Vegetation is sparse, and what few shrubs and spindly trees remain frame a shadowy, narrow trail to the west.  The sounds of nocturnal life are subtle, and only a few husks of snake skins and the occasional chirp of a cricket are evidence that any creature occupies the area."
