    "Several torches ring this circular room, casting their glow on the dusty stone floor.  Looking closer at the stones you notice triangular runes drawn in blood which, linked together, also form a circle.  In the center of the circle lies an outstretched skeleton with a rusty dagger protruding from its skull."
