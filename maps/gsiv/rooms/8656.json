    "The sharp scent of freshly cut wood fills the air.  Square samples of finely carved walls and flooring are neatly stacked, one atop the other, throughout the room.  A chandelier suspended from thin silvery chains provides excellent lighting for the shoppers who come for the master carver's quality woodwork."
