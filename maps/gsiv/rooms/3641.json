    "Outside a local shop, a small evergreen has been neatly trimmed into the shape of a seated rolton.  Someone has attached two small black discs to emulate the eyes.  Another bush has been carved into the likeness of a small halfling and stands nearly three feet high, its entire body wreathed in blossoms of an intriguing, pale purple hue.  Silver moonlight strikes the figures from an awkward angle, creating shadows that shudder and curl across the cobblestones.",
