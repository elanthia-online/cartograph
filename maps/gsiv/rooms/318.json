    "This small niche between two buildings has been neatly landscaped into a tiny moonlit garden, its careful mosaic of flagstones interspersed with patches of trimmed grass.  A low stone bench rests along one vine-covered wall, and a patch of colorful violets surrounds a painted wooden barrel in one corner.",
