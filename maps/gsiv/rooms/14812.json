  "description": [
    "Fronting the graceful exterior of the Teras Isle Bard Guild, the loggia is a long gallery open on the west to the vast oceanic panorama.  Overhead is a series of wooden arches, like ribs cloaked with dense growths of bougainvillea and jasmine.  Large terracotta planters are set along the promenade, all filled and overflowing with a riot of blossoms in red, pink and white."
