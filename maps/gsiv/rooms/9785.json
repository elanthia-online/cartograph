    "Tiny pebbles dot the floor randomly, their pale hue a stark contrast to the dark roots which slither across and up into the curving ceiling.  Light scratches mar the smooth wall, some twisting jaggedly several different ways while others form straight, rough lines in the earth.  A few patches of lichen nestle inside the shallow gouges, accompanying others growing upon the low ceiling."
