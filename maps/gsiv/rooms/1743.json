    "The icy, flat, glaciated surface spreads out to the east and south.  A long, wide spur of the Gossamer Valley extends to the north.  The ground rises slightly and sheds its snowy covering in many areas, exposing large expanses of permafrost.  It is soil, though, and not ice.  Yellow-brown moss and light green sawgrass attempt to grow in spots that receive extra daytime sun, but these are still relatively few compared to the totally barren sections.",
