    "Walls of firmly packed earth encircle the room, their faces pock-marked with hundreds of tiny niches.  Long and short benches surround a rock-lined firepit, while a wooden table near the back of the room provides an array of refreshments.  An array of banners hangs from long posts upon the western side of the room, their long lengths dusting the firmly packed, earthen ground."
