    "A pair of tall kegs partially blocks the passageway, both clearly labeled in dwarven.  There is an acrid stench coming from somewhere nearby, the smell tangy and metallic.  Whatever the stench is, it's definitely not pleasant.",
    "One of the torches illuminating this portion of the passageway is sputtering badly and nearly spent.  Several miners walk past, all ignoring the torch.  One of them can be overheard muttering, \"Must be an elven torch.\""
