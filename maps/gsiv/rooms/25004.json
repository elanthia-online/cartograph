    "A circular outline of charred logs indicates that a fire of some sort once burned in the middle of the camp, the circumference rimmed with a mixture of weapons and eating utensils left behind.  A fine layer of mold spreads amongst the food-filled plates and flagons, the grey-green fuzz covering the additional pools of blood and gnarled pieces of bone sunk deep into the dirt.  A tattered banner flaps from a single rusted pike, the embroidery indecipherable from exposure to the elements."
