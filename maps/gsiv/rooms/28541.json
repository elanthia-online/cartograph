    "Woven reeds cover the dusty floor and add a slight hint of mold to this stuffy, cramped space.  Raised on a slanted crate is a short mahogany hat stand, which leans haphazardly to one side.  Across the room, a tall brass hat rack occupies a small sphere of light under a tarnished brass lantern with a soot-choked globe."
