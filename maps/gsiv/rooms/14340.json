    "The hall stretches off to the northwest and southeast, covered in a fine, red plush carpet.  A finely carved mahogany railing offers a good view of the common room below, showing bustling activity as people wander to and from the bar.  An ivory-inlaid oak door sits nestled between a pair of small paintings along the eastern wall."
