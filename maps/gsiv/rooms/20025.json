  "description": [
    "The rough outlines of half pillars have been hewn from the rock, giving the feel of a crude temple.  Two statues, one carved from shimmering glaes and the other from soapstone in a sickly shade of green, glare at each other in the center of the room.  The figures stand on a pedestal of black stone, words painstakingly chipped into the surface.  The angry glow from a small lava window in the floor provides illumination."
