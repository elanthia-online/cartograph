  "description": [
    "Four stone pillars, one at each corner of the room, once supported the long-gone ceiling.  Broken heavy wooden beams lean precariously, having fallen from their supports.   A lone, rusting metal bracket hangs loosely from one of the timbers dangling a bit of rope, the only indication that a bell once hung there.  Bits of wood and stone litter the rough wood plank floor here."
