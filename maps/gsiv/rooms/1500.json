    "The tapered top of a single yew tree peaks over the corner of the high stone wall surrounding the villa to the southeast, but no roof is visible beyond the wall, nor does the solid oak gate permit any glimpse of what lies within.  The rough stone wall forming the northeast corner of the intersection is not nearly as tall, and a copper-sheathed dome can be seen beyond it, gleaming in the starlight.",
