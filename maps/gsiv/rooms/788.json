    "The sheet of stone comes to a sudden end by swerving to rejoin the mountain.  Just at the terminus of the ledge, a tunnel has been carved into the face of the peak, providing access to the shelter within.  The sharp alpine wind rushes across the entrance, creating a harsh and ominous whistle."
