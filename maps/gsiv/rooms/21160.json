    "Beads of sweat, their plump bodies occasionally condensing into larger drops that slide down the wall and pool upon the teak floor, cling to the rectangular panes of glass that are fitted into the pewter-wrapped window.  Redwood boards rise upon the eastern edge and form the supports of the narrow crawlspace, which curves north and southward."
