  "description": [
    "The presence of decomposing stumps interspersed throughout the grass indicates that this area might once have been a forest long ago lost to the woodsman's axe.  Some of the stumps measure several feet across, and the trees that topped them must have been impressive in height and spread.  Now, with the tops long gone, the stumps provide homes to robust colonies of ants that scurry up and down the sides to transport food into their homes."
