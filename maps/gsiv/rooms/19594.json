    "The cobblestone path widens, becoming a large rectangular common area.  Wrought iron benches have been placed along the perimeter of the platform and flanked with tall ceramic vases of flowers.  At the center of the commons is a large rose garden filled with hues ranging from white to pale lavender.  A pair of short stone steps leads down to the east toward a small reflection pool.",
    "Arranged for a rewarding view of the rose garden, wrought iron benches occupy various corners of the garden, with one resting beneath a tall lamppost that dangles a large glaesine orb.  Silvery moonlight glitters off of the white cobblestones set in the path, as well as a pair of short stone steps that leads to a wishing well.  Cedar chips scattered upon the ground prevent the massive amounts of roses from becoming cloying, while a light breeze brings forth the faint scent of the nearby ocean."
