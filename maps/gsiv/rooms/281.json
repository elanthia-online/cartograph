    "The east-west road continues, closed in on the south by the militia barracks and on the north by the twelve-foot-high wall of the city itself.  The occasional thud of leather boots in unison upon cobbled pavement and the clipped shouts of barked orders reverberate off the modwir walls along this part of the road.  The scents of leather, weapon oil and hearty cooking fill the night air.",
