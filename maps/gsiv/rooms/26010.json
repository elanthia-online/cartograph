    "The room has high vaulted ceilings and large arched windows that allow the moonlight to illuminate the room.  A polished oak credenza is filled with a bounty of freshly prepared fare.  In the center of the room is a long oak banquet table lined with rich velvet-upholstered chairs.  Elegant silk tapestries are mounted along the walls of the room."
