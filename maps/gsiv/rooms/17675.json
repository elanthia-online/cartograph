    "Torch light casts shadows across the cavern that stretch onwards to the west.  Single drops of water fall from the ceiling into a small puddle on the cavern floor offering a resounding plinking noise every so many minutes.  The chamber is haphazardly filled with various containers and crates.  Against one wall are three small wine casks set beside a makeshift weapon rack with muddy tracks leading from one to the other, then out of the cavern."
