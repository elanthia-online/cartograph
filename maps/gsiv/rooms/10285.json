    "The dangerous climb to the top of the briar thicket yields a view of the surrounding countryside, including the entire briar thicket and the small crab apple grove beyond it to the south.  Though, truth be told, as a lookout spot it leaves much to be desired: whoever or whatever might be moving through the thicket is completely obscured beneath thirty feet of thorns, branches, leaves, flowers, and berries."
