    "Majestic oak trees sway in the breeze over a well-manicured emerald green lawn.  Dominating the center of the garden, cascading waters flow from a towering marble fountain.  Stylized garden beds, brimming with lavender and roses, create a sweet scent that drifts gently in the air.  In a stately fashion, a pair of elegantly carved drake statues, one of ebon and one of gold, flank the approach to a wide, gold-flecked stone door."
