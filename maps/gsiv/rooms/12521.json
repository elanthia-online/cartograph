    "The interior of the great city wall is lined with granite statues, all of dwarven or giantmen heroes.  A group of children plays among them, scampering about in a game of 'Dwarves and Orcs.'  An elven matron is seated on a bench opposite, keeping one eye on her book and the other on the heroes, past and future."
