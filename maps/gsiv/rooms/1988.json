  "description": [
    "Swales of green turf rise against the town's rock walls to the north and west, forming a cozy bowl-shaped enclosure about the street.  Carved oaken benches line the cobbles, separated by the sharply-sculpted shapes of boxwood hedges into individual conversation nooks of their own.  An elven couple lounges in the grass, whispering and giggling."
