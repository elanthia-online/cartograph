  "description": [
    "The narrow tunnel opens into a spacious circular room with several small lit braziers illuminating the interior.  Several enormous moss-covered stalactites hang precariously from the ceiling, forming dark shadows along the walls.  The farside wall seem to be hidden by a curtain of colorful stalactites that drapes over the surface.  Niches have been carved along the remaining circumference of the room, and within them are set some inviting tables."
