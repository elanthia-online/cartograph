  "description": [
    "Reflecting the moonlight with their pale color, spectacularly tall sandstone cliffs cause the rainforest to come to an abrupt dead-end, blocking out any further growth, save for the vines that climb up the cliffs and hang down with invitation to climb up.  The rushing river hurtles straight out through a single wide gap in the cliff, quickly disappearing out of sight."
