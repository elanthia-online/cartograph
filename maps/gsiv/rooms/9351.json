    "[Ruined Tavern]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The fieldstone walls rise over two stories high in a couple spots, and stubs of charred beams protrude from the walls, evidence that this building once had a second floor.  Wind and rain have washed the soot from the walls, except in the corners and the seams between the stones, giving the interior a shadowed and darkened cast even in broad daylight.  Shards of broken glass, pottery and charred barrel staves along one wall indicate that this was likely a public house or tavern prior to its demise."
