  "description": [
    "Sticky and thick, the oppressive air is an unwelcome companion beneath the cave-like jungle interior.  Overhead, leafy branches overlap to create a broad living roof that filters out most of the moons' beams.  Humming loudly, a large cloud of mosquitoes constantly searches for its next unsuspecting victim.  Dotting the jungle floor, unusual piles of sticks and webbing clump beneath large fern fronds."
