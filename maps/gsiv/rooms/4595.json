    "Murals on the walls depict various scenes from the life and times of the earlier years of the Turamzzyrian Empire.  Soft tinkling sounds and the scent of wild roses fill the room giving it a light and carefree atmosphere.  Swaying gently back and forth from the heavy chain that holds it securely to the ceiling, the prisms of a multifaceted crystal chandelier create a musical sound.  The crystal prisms refract the light and lengthen the shadows over the walls and floor."
