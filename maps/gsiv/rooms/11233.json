    "Silence and serenity reign in this oblong room.  On a table beside the arched doorway are a matching silver basin and goblet, now tarnished with age.  The tattered remains of woven prayer mats are aligned in front of a faded tapestry.  In the center of the room is a perfectly circular pool of still water."
