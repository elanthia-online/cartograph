    "Patches of luminescent moss grow along the length of the ceiling of the tunnel, the slight glow emanating from the moss overpowered by the presence of a single, bright burning torch.  A cord of rope lies forgotten and unused, half buried in the floor of the tunnel.  Going back and forth along the edges of the tunnel floor are a series of small paw prints."
