  "description": [
    "The brilliant hues of hundreds of flowers are muted in the shadows of night, the closed blossoms lining thick liana vines wrapped around massive trees.  Delicate moonflowers, pale and glistening with mist in the dappled moonlight, compete for resources with scrubby dandelions.  Sprouting up amongst ferns and decaying logs, tall patches of blue, white, and purple larkspur sway in the cool night breeze.  Towards the south the jungle begins to thin along a rocky decline, and the faint sounds of waves can be heard."
