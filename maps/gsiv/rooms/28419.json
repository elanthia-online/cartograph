    "Thick clumps of beard moss drape from intersecting wood ceiling beams, with various bits purposely framing a makeshift teak door.  Pale moonlight creeps through a paneless window, casting long shadows from a pair of stone mannequins upon a shaggy bearskin rug.  Though subtle, the unmistakable odor of mildew poorly concealed by a bouquet of lemongrass and mint lingers in the air.",

Sunlight pours through a paneless window, illuminating a pair of stone mannequins barely obscuring a shaggy bearskin rug.  Though subtle, the unmistakable odor of mildew poorly concealed by a bouquet of lemongrass and mint lingers in the air."
