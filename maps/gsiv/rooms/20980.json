    "Slipping in and out of the gently curving landscape, the river picks up a bit of speed as it leaves the dark hills of the south and heads towards the northern jungle.  The western bank is comprised of a sheer cliff of dark granite, while the eastern bank has been fitted with a small landing dock.  Arching over the water course is an aerial bridge crafted of rough granite and pebbles."
