    "A couple brooms and rakes sit in a community rack, waiting for homeowners to pick up some tools to clean their yard.  Stonemasons pored over the construction of low walls, carving in wild scenes of fantastic battles, heroic figures, and beautiful love stories.  Some kind soul left a pile of stones in a large hole just off the center of the road to prevent draft animals and travellers from injuring themselves."
