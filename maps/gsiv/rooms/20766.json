  "description": [
    "The front, rounded wall of the semi-circular room is crafted from fine fishing nets stretched taut within a driftwood frame that also houses the entry door.  Standing against the flat back wall is a weathered grey table, while a carved wooden sign hangs above.  A white archway leads to the other half of the bottom level, while a set of narrow stairs heads upward through a rectangular hole in the ceiling.  Water lapping against the pilings below provides a soft, rhythmic sound, and the sea breezes permeate this open room."
