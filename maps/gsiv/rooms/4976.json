    "Silken threads of a gigantic spiderweb completely ensconce the far right wall of this chamber.  Some rusted, augmented chain mail armor and a visored helm, as well as the bones of various creatures, rest underneath this silent deathtrap.  Huge, beady red eyes stare out from an orifice directly above the spiderweb."
