    "Looking out over the columned walk below, the tower's second floor balcony provides a view of the antechamber's regal decay in its grim totality.  Before the overlook sits a heavy striking cobra statue.  A length of black cord is knotted about its neck, trailing over the railing's edge and pulled tight by a weight from below.  The walkway curves past the statue toward the next level, its sandstone tiles blanketed by a gold and green runner of raw silk."
