    "Several iron pots heavily stained with a blackish residue top the wall and have been set into wooden dowels to allow them to be easily tipped.  The containers aren't terribly large however, hardly bigger than a child's cookpot.  The spillage from whatever might have been in these miniature cauldrons has left the walls below them coated with a thick dried sludge."
