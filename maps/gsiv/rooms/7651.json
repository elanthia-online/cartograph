    "[A Tidal Cave]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Years of tidal erosion have carved out a rough cave large enough for unrestricted movement.  Cool seawater laps around your ankles and the light filtering in from the cave mouth reflects off the resulting wavelets in a hypnotic display.  The tunnel extends southward, deep within the cliff, but peering in that direction you notice that the light does not diminish into blackness.  Far into the cave, you can barely make out a faint emerald glow illuminating the rough walls."
