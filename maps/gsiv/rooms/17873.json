    "A trophy case decorates the corner of the hallway, tall enough to rest flush against the ceiling.  A glance inside is rewarded with the glint of precious metal from the varied and numerous trophies within.  Many of the trophies appear to date back quite some time and were earned for skills that few self-respecting rogues would possess."
