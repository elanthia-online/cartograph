  "description": [
    "Vaulted ceilings are hung with a series of thick, beaded tapestries, their woven lengths adding a splash of color to the silver-veined white marble they rest against.  An enormous circular table crafted of bird's-eye maple is centered beneath a round skylight of stained glass, its surface covered with delicacies and treats.  Overlapping rugs bearing geometric patterns give a warm, welcoming feel to the sterile white of the room and support the weight of several high-backed armchairs."
