    "[Zul Logoth, Sapphire Tunnel]"

  "description": [
    "The sweet scent of composted wood pervades the tunnel, though the source of the odor is not readily apparent.  A steel door occupies a portion of the west wall, and a burnished brass sign flanks the door.  A crude stone arch along the eastern wall provides entrance to a small shop.  Dwarves carrying packages and dry goods wander in and out of the shop.  Some seem happy and gregarious, while others are aloof and serious."
