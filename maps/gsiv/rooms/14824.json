    "A thick round of grass-covered earth sits inside a wooden frame attached to an elaborate pulley and rope system, designed to roll into the opening like a plug.  The top of this hillock has been worked to create a small garden, the bordered flower beds edged with a variety of fragrant herbs.  A slight whiff of sulphur occasionally scents the air here, sending up a puff of steam from a partially hidden hot spring."
