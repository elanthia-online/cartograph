    "The path takes a sharp bend here, ascending toward the coast and descending into a deep pine-filled valley.  The valley is cold and a thick fog gathers over the forest floor, secluding the thick pine needle carpet from view.  A chill is in the air, and the cold is accentuated by the dampness."
