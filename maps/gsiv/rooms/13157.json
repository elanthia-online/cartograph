    "Painted across the three walls of this chamber is the picturesque peak of Sunfist at sunrise, noon, and sunset.  Faded scrolls documenting the early days of the Guardians of Sunfist have been carefully preserved under glass on a long steel table.  Some old rolaren weaponry from the early days of dwarven and giantman cooperation rest carefully on smoky glaes racks."
