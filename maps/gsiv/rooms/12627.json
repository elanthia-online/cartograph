  "description": [
    "Two dessicated corpses are propped up against one wall, the remains of clothing draped around them.  Their arms are raised high above them, locked into manacles set into the wall.  The floor is covered with grime and rubble, and out of the corner of your eye, you swear you can see the floor moving.  Looking closer, you realize the movement is due to the hundreds of large rats scurrying about inside."
