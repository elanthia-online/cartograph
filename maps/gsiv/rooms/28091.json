  "description": [
    "Brisk with chill, an alpine breeze sets the saffron and gold leaves in the upper boughs of the nearby aspen trees to swaying.  Moonbeams win their way free of the foliage and dispel shadows that threaten a simple shale and glass windchime that hangs from a nearby white-barked limb.  Thin game trails, illuminated by several firefly-filled glass jars, disappear into the grove, meandering away from a canvas-woven domed enclosure."
