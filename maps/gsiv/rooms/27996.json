    "Animal pelts and strips of forest green felt line the floor and walls of the spacious geteld.  Centered in the room is a large pine cot piled with layers of heavy sheepskin.  Hanging from the frame of the secluded sleeping nook are several brass lanterns, their glass panes etched with a pattern of wisteria blossoms.  Off to one side of the curtain is a wooden ram statue."
