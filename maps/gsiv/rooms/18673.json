    "Stretching around three sides of the room, a long wooden shelf houses all manner of jars, beakers, bottles, droppers, rods, and other alchemical supplies.  The fourth wall is dominated by an enormous slab of slate replete with obscure numbers and symbols, along with vague drifts of chalk dust where old notes and formulas have been rubbed out."
