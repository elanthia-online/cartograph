    "Verdant greenish-black hedges border a weathered path leading up to a two-story wooden edifice, which despite its worn down appearance, is relatively intact.  Just outside the building, a tall rusted sconce stands sentinel, its lit silvery-blue flame casting a sea of dancing shadows along a battered wooden door."
