    "Hazy with smoke from the wood fire and redolent of ale and other spirits, this spacious room is a gathering place for local residents.  In the center of the room, a fireplace with an immense circular hearth provides wanted warmth in winter and a cook-fire year round.  Tables and benches run the length of the room on opposing sides of the fireplace, with more at either end, and the floor is strewn with fresh rushes.  Bundles of fragrant herbs and bottles of brew line the shelves behind the serving counter"
