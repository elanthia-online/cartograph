    "In a small, sheltered depression in the uplifted rocks, groundsel flowers and the red stalks of fruiting mountain heather form a four-inch-high canopy.  The cold night air is undisturbed by the noises of insects, however.  The small patch of flowers seems so very out of place against the stark, grey sides of the mountains and the bright white surface of the valley's snow-covered floor.  Yet here and again, similar patches of life present themselves all along the valley.",
    "In a small, sheltered depression in the uplifted rocks, groundsel flowers and the red stalks of fruiting mountain heather form a four-inch-high canopy.  Bumblebees flit noisily among the flowers, gathering sustenance to take back to their homes.  The small patch of color seems so very out of place against the stark, grey sides of the mountains and the bright white surface of the valley's snow-covered floor.  Yet here and again, similar patches of life present themselves all along the valley."
