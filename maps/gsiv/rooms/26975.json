    "Rising from the sand, several desert rose clusters dot the garden with their pale, crystalline heads and glint slightly in the dim light of false stars that are imbedded in the black glass of the garden's dome.  Small calcified shrubs burst from the black sands that surround a salty pond of bright pink, while the skeletal remains of a sea eagle is perched upon a dead log.  Soot, sulfur, and brimstone fill the air with their biting, acrid odor."
