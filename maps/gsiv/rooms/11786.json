    "A massive snake ringed with coral and black weaves its way around one of the dense trees and vanishes into the leafy depths only to appear a few branches higher.  Quiet as the viper might be in its movement, it must be disturbing something nearby as a loud chittering can be heard coming from the tall brush near the hovels."
