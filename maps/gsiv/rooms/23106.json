    "Massive gashes in the ceiling effectively render it obselete.  Leaning far to one side, the left-most wall is partially held up by a series of ropes looped through hooks in the wall and then tied to stone blocks located in the opposite corner.  The remains of a shelf hold several tarnished silver instruments, small envelopes, and bowls filled with dark-colored glop that has attracted a plethora of buzzing flies.  Illuminating the darkness is a small circle of candles.",
