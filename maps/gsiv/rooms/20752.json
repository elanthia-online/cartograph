    "A towering building built of ice stands tall at the end of a snow-packed trail.  Icicle-covered trees hang heavy over the structure, every breeze causing a tinkling sound to emanate from above.  Two detailed ice statues, depicting both male and female halfling skaters, stand on either side of an ice-covered arch.  Beside the entrance, a large wool-lined cart is piled high with wintery supplies."
