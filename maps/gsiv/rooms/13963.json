  "description": [
    "Cooks busy themselves with their duties, checking the oven and stirring large pots on the stove.  The aroma of fresh baked bread drifts through the air, mingling with the scent of spices.  A shelf rests against a far wall filled with jars of herbs and kitchen instruments.  Near the entryway leading south, a large counter sits with plates of hot food that have been ordered by the patrons of the tavern."
