    "Weaving the tops of several trees together, the branches of an ancient and oversized banyan tree stretch across the sky.  Tendrils of mist slide in and out among the leaves above, blocking all light from penetrating into the lower levels of the forest.  Smaller trees sprout up between stands of rising ferns, collecting beads of moisture on limb and frond.  The smell of decay and mold fills the area."
