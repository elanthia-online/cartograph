  "description": [
    "A thick bronze wire has been strung up between two tent posts, upon which hang a number of instruments.  Beneath the aerial display is a simple glass case illuminated by lit green and blue votive candles.  A ramshackle armoire doubles as a bookcase housing a number of bound musical compositions.  Nearby, a wide brass stand has been partially draped by a faded patchwork quilt, though most of its contents are visible from other areas of the tent."
