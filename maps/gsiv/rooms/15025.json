    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the knotty pine walls, and a glossy modwir plank ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a mistwood plank floor.  There is a vine-carved mahogany table on one side of the shop and a gilded maple cabinet on the other."
