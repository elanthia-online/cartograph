    "A few park benches sit around a small square, taking advantage of the shade trees stretching out over the plaza.  The central focus of the clearing is an elegant wishing well, complete with decorative roof.  Children beg their parents for coins to flip into its inky blackness, hoping for their planned extravagance to come true."
