  "description": [
    "Decorated with colorful feathers and charms that dangle from the ceiling, the shop space is cheery and bright.  Unnaturally bright light blazes from a series of candles, the smoke wafting from them imparting the scent of lavender into the air.  A single loom spans the a large portion of the space, its length hung with lockets rather than the results of weaving.  Past the loom, a small, diamond-shaped hatch is nearly hidden by an extravagant drape of cotton streamers."
