    "The mountains rise up majestically to the south, silhouetted against the evening sky where the forest tries to carve life out of the barren rock.  You feel very small, caught between these breathtaking summits and the seemingly infinite sea to the north.  To the west, the terrain is a jumble of broken rock and steep inclines, making further travel in that direction impractical.",
