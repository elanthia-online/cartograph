  "description": [
    "The air in this dimly lit room carries the scent of parchment and leather.  Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves are packed tightly with thick tomes and parchment scrolls.  The most valuable volumes are located on a rack above a long study table, each fastened securely to a rod with a length of chain.  Oil lamps burn brightly on several reading desks equipped with inkwells and quill pens.  Two comfortable chairs and an overstuffed leather sofa create a cozy reading nook for more casual study sessions."
