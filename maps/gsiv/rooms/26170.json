    "Dim light invades the space from the eastern and western edges of the passageway, its sources not strong enough to dispel the disfigured shadows that climb the stone walls.  Empty wrought iron rings dangle from one of the remaining rafters of the long-lost ceiling, their chains rattling and creaking at odd intervals, while below them stone and debris covered rugs dislodge dust into the air and muffle the sound of those that pass through."
