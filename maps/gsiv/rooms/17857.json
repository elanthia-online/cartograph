    "Little more than an alcove, the walls and floor of this small room are almost completely obscured by all manner of trophies.  Pelts from a wide variety of creatures run the gamut from luxurious fur to brittle scales, creating a patchwork montage with no discernable pattern.  Some of the more exotic specimens have been used in various sorts of crafting, including an opalescent buckler laced together from myklian scales.  Against the back wall, a small wood and glass case contains several ki-lin horns."
