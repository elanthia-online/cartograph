    "Hanging from the ceiling is an oversized birdcage contains a miniature winged black urgh.  Below the cage, a scattering of filth lines the floor.  A small ladder is propped up against the northern wall, but all the rungs are broken.  A large sign hanging from the birdcage reads, \"No open da cage, or urgh flies aways.\""
