    "The moons shine down brightly, illuminating the trail and sparkling off the surface of the river below.  The river makes slow progress to the west, its surface smooth and unbroken by protruding rocks.  An occasional fish breaks the surface in pursuit of a winged insect only to fall back with a splash, watery ripples radiating out from the point where it landed.  The trail proceeds steadily in an east/west direction.",
