  "description": [
    "Deteriorated and littered with scraps of decaying seaweed, the roadbed splits off into two directions near a faded felwood sign.  Cobblestones sprout from the dirt surface as if they had been shaken from the rear of a bouncing wagon.  A boardwalk is visible to the northwest and off to the northeast long thin arms encompassing a cylindrical object can be seen.  A pair of malevolent eyes watch your every move from the shadows of the faded, deleterious, worm-eaten ruins of houses."
