  "description": [
    "High grasses wave gently in the light breeze that travels through the area, their slender tips dipping to touch the riverstone path that leads away from the pond's edge.  Enormous lily pads speckle the pond, which is teeming with a variety of fish that can be glimpsed beneath the clear waters.  A pair of benches is set to the right of the shore and frame a pair of steps leading into an open front kitchen, while a low clothesline rests opposite them airing various articles of clothing."
