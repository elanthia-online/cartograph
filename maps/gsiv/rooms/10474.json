    "Large displays of shops in different stages of construction can be seen here taking up the majority of this enormous section of the warehouse with enough space for buyers and warehouse workers to move about freely.  A series of crates and large boxes have been neatly stacked and laid out to maximize the available open space in the center of the room."
