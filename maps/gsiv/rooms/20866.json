    "Large bookcases, filled with ancient tomes all bound with dark purple seals, stretch from wall to wall.  In the center of the room is a large, circular fireplace, its iron curtain protecting the plush fur throws that are laid out before it.  Chairs set about two large lamp-lit mahogany tables provide a perfect place for late night studies.  About the room rest several large trophies, and a large portrait hangs above the bookcases."
