  "description": [
    "Two of the rough wooden walls of the shack lean slightly inward, braced to keep from collapsing entirely by a system of improvised levers and joists.  The canvas ceiling overhead dips downwards in the middle, burdened by what appears to be a sloshing liquid weight.  Set out of range of any potential drips are two roughly hewn crates.  A skewed opening leads out to the front of the shop and a canvas curtain leads out the back."
