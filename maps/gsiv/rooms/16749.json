    "Nearly hidden amongst fallen leaves of browns and yellows, remnants of other autumns, the trail continues along a straight path on a north-south axis.  Overhead, the beams of moonlight are sporadically broken by the flight of the forest's winged inhabitants about the thick canopy overhead.  Their calls, shrieks, and whistles only rarely break the silence of the woods.  By the side of the trail stands an ivy-covered stone column.",
