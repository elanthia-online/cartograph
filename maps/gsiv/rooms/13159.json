  "description": [
    "Austere in its decor, the office houses only the essential items for day-to-day operations.  A simple steel desk is home to a large tome, which contains the names of current members and their ranking.  Only a single luminescent toadstool resides in a plain brass pot in the corner, offering up its soft light and accentuating the drabness of the white walls."
