    "An ethereal light shines down through several stained glass windows, illuminating a black marble altar.  Simple tapestries line the stone walls, and simple wooden benches line solemnly before the altar.  An old dwarven woman kneels before the altar, praying softly under her breath, while silent acolytes wander quietly about, lighting candles and incense."
