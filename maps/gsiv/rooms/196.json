    "Several small shops surround the cobblestoned court.  From one of the smaller establishments, a low greystone building with colored glaes windows and pleasant yellow curtains, a rich, sugary smell wafts into the square.  A slight smile comes to the face of many elves as they pass by.",
    "Several small shops surround the cobblestoned court.  From one of the smaller establishments, a low marble building with colored glass windows and pale blue curtains, a rich, sugary smell wafts into the square.  Above the shop's blue door hangs a polished oak signboard."
