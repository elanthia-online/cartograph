    "The enclosing walls of the wagon are crafted of pale grey ash overlaid with a coat of lacquer with a matte finish, the effect softening the already subtle whorls of the woodgrain.  Mounted on the side wall is a small glass-doored cabinet, and directly beneath it is a set of square pegs.  On the opposite wall is a slender featureless mannequin that gazes sightlessly toward the glaes-windowed door, its back turned to the rear space of the wagon, which is roped off to bar further access.  Near the door, a black metal display shelf is bracketed to the wall."
