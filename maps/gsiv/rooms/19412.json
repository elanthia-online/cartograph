    "The double doors open to smallish sleeping quarters with vivid spindrift blue walls and a knotted seagrass carpet.  Pale lemon-colored pillows are piled on a narrow daybed that is swaddled in soft brushed cotton linens.  Hanging above the bed, a delicate twine mobile suspends a collection of periwinkle moonsnail shells from the ceiling."
