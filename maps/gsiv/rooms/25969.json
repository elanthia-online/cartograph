  "description": [
    "This is the heart of the main square of Lich's Landing.  A number of makeshift shops are clustered around the bazaar, with a strange and gruesome mixture of undead moving about in a mock display of the living.  To the north, an old well with grime-covered stones sits in the shadow of a gnarled, dark oak tree.  The oak is tall, its bark black and glistening with sticky blood.  Hanging from the branches of the tree are a dozen malformed bodies, each garbed in the uniform of the Wehnimer's militia."
