  "description": [
    "The rounded exterior wall is made of the same fine netting that encloses the porch downstairs, allowing the salty breezes to permeate the semi-circular room.  A variety of plants take residence on a tiered wooden table that runs along the netted wall, allowing the fauna ample sunlight.  Two low padded benches rest against the interior wall, flanking a narrow white archway.  Standing beside a set of spiral stairs are two potted palms and a stone planter filled with colorful flowers, their faint scents adding a subtle tropical ambiance to the room, while a small sea glass fountain sits on the floor nearby."
