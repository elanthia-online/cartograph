    "The smell of incense hangs heavy in this smoky room, and scattered candles provide a dim flickering light.  Ash shelves flank a stone fireplace centered in the left wall, and a hammock is set up to the right.  A polished oak desk dominates the center of the room, and a glass display case stands just inside the door on the left.  In the far wall, two narrow windows running from floor to ceiling allow very little light in, but provide a bird's eye view of the streets below."
