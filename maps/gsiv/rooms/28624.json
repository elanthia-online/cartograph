    "The strong aroma of cinnamon permeates from a wooden archway and fills the small living quarters.  A pink sandstone fireplace dominates one wall while a thick seagull-emblazoned rug spreads out before it.  A varnished rocking chair rests before a wide glass window, and a small driftwood table is angled in a corner."
