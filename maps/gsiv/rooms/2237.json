  "description": [
    "At the foot of a barrier of jagged glaes boulders, the passageway curves quickly out of sight around an immense outcropping of blood-red glaes.  The rare stone glistens in the low light, embraced by black glaes, which surrounds it and accents it with the contrast in color.  Within the stone, a dim reflection of light flickers and pulses, as though the huge formation is a beating heart with convoluted striations for veins."
