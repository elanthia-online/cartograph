  "description": [
    "Here at the southernmost end of the village is a frightening panorama of destruction. Though the foundation stones of many buildings remain, all are scorched and blackened by fire.  The few structures that still stand appear to be deserted.  Even though the area around the hamlet is heavily forested, not a single tree stands within the village boundaries."
