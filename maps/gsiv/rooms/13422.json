    "Pale stargazer lilies are arranged in a circular swirling pattern upon a small hill, their soft hue shot with dark streaks of violet.  The arched windows of the manor's upper floors look down from high above, amber light playing across the windowpanes in rippling waves.  Silver accents race across the walls of the building, the lustrous designs twining about one another in an intricate dance."
