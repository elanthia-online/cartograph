    "Flawlessly maintained, a spacious and well-lit circular chamber houses a myriad of heat sources, all displayed on individual blue granite pedestals.  Subtly decorated with vibrant-colored mosaic accents, eight fluted marble columns are spaced throughout, like standing guards of the perpetual fire blazing in the center of the rotunda.  Near the entryway, a robe-clad assistant fitfully polishes the marble counter while keeping a keen eye on the shoppers."
