    "Dark wooden trellises are positioned against the walls of the guild, and lush ivy has wrapped around the structures so completely as to nearly obscure the building.  A simple dirt path leads northward into a small valley where a ring of willows lies, and soft white flowers line its edges.  Blades of long grass sway slowly with every gentle breeze that passes through the area, and the quiet sounds of nature abound in this peaceful garden."
