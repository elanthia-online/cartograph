    "High walls of rosy hues encapsulate the small space within the tree, their smooth faces decorated with the dark rings of age.  Thick glass jars are tied to spindled poles that crisscross the ceiling and are filled with starflies, who provide a soft glow of illumination for the surroundings.  Thin shelves line the walls and display their wares, while a curtain of liana vines provides egress."
