    "[Alpine Meadow, Wooden Dome]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "This massive dome-shaped structure looks rickety from afar, but up close it appears much sturdier with its thick oak and maple beams.  Protruding several feet from the top of the structure is a twisted crystal spire.  Between each beam is a round oak-framed window decorated with an overflowing flowerbox and a pair of dimly lit hanging lanterns.  Surrounding the structure are tens of thousands of wildflowers in every imagineable color."
