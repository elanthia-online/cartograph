    "Rising up from the jungle floor, a lone honey bee tree towers overhead, its branches reaching high up into the canopy.  Huge buttresses support it at the base and keep the giant from toppling over.  The thick bark glistens with an amber sap that oozes out from the cracks.  Hanging from the underside of each high branch are immense honeycombs surrounded by clouds of bees.  A layer of mud coats the ground that slopes upwards to the east."
