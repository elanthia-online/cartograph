    "Long and narrow, the canvas tent stretches out along much of the rickety pier, with rolled-up window openings cut into the cloth walls.  A thick support overhead holds taut the peaked roof and suspends small oil lamps giving off both illumination and the pleasing scent of lemon verbena.  Narrow tables break the flow the space here and there, moving toward the far end of the cavernous space."
