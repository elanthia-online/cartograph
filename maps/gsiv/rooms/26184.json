    "[Puffing Clouds Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "This large pine table has been carved at the four major compass points with whimsical cloud faces.  Each of the carvings has wide eyes and big puffy cheeks, their lips pursed as they blow imaginary winds inwards towards the center of the table.  A small replica of the Isle in bas-relief rests there as an intricate focal point."
