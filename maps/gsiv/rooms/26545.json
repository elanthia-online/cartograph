    "Chainsil curtains decorate the three windows within this small room, their sashes flung wide to allow the night air in.  Twin mannequins act as sentries upon either side of shelves, while a pair of divans provides seating for weary customers.  A brightly illuminated chandelier hangs from the ceiling, its delicate crystals reflecting the light in rainbow patterns upon the floor.",

Twin humanoid forms act as sentries upon either side of shelves, while a pair of divans provides seating for weary customers.  A dormant chandelier hangs from the ceiling, its delicate crystal pieces chiming softly at sporadic intervals.",
