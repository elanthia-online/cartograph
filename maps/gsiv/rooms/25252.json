    "Shadows drape a lacy fan of darkness over of the stony hallway, despite the addition of several copper-crested sconces burning tallow candles in the far corners.  A frenzy of primitive drawings done in brown iron gall ink are scrawled over the floor and threshold leading to the isolated balcony to the southwest."
