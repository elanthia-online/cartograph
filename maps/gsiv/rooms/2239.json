    "The tunnel twists like a drake's tail, its glaes walls scarred and pocked with fissures.  Little spouts of steam burst from the openings at intervals, then wisp away to nothing leaving a scent of sulfur.  To the northeast, the passageway twists away from the formation of red glaes, the ruby glow from the rock chasing it away through the blackness like a trail of fire."
