  "description": [
    "Dark oak-paneled walls encapsulate the room on all sides, broken by several ports of entry.  A set of soft burgundy arm chairs face each other across a muted gold area rug that covers the center of the ebonwood flooring.  Against the nearby wall, an oak sideboard provides various refreshments for those waiting in the foyer.  In the eastern wall, an archway leads to a dimly lit room, while in the western wall, a carved oak door and a curved frost white doorway are separated by potted ferns.  Tendrils of cold emanate from the cracks around a set of glass double doors."
