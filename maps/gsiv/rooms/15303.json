    "Beneath a mosaic tiled ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the textured sandstone walls.  A gilded maple table sits in one corner while a worn rug rests on the planked floor.",
    "Textured sandstone walls rise from a sturdy planked floor.  Just above a pile of striped throw pillows hangs a pearl-handled filigreed mandolin, and a mosaic tiled ceiling completes the picture.  An oval-shaped speckled marble counter and a gilded maple table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
