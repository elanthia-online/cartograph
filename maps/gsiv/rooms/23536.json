    "A walkway of crushed limestone glows in the moonlight as it winds its way through the manicured wilds of the gardens towards a grey stone manor in the distance.  Moss-laden trees take on a sinister feel in the gloom as they shelter rows of dark bushes.  Dark shapes writhe in the moonlight on either side of the meandering path.  Several bubbling fountains mark the convergences of paths rejoining the main thoroughfare.  Glistening in the moonlight along the eastern edge of the property is a large lake, complete with a small fishing dock."
