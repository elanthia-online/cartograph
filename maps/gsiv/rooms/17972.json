    "A single elaborately carved brass oil lamp on the east wall illuminates the hall with a soft glow.  The richly colored tapestries that cover the walls are broken by an opening in the west wall draped with a heavy grey silk curtain.  A pleasing scent of incense and spice wafts in from the arch at the north end of the hall."
