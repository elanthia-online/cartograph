    "Drumble's dimly lit shop is piled to the rafters with a tangle of tables.  From each tottering pile protrudes a strange combination of plain and polished and white-painted table legs, the item to which they belong quite indiscernible without close inspection.  Drumble himself leans casually against one particularly diverse stack, grumbling quietly to himself every time a customer requests a deeply-buried item."
