    "The lane approaches a circular orangery, offering a filigreed pattern of low, trimmed hedges.  Forming an intricate swirl, the bushes are immaculately manicured and the crushed white gravel surrounding the bed accents their form.  Houses ring Fairview Circle, their facades as aristocratic as the landscape."
