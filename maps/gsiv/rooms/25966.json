    "Bordered to the southwest by a small watercourse, this manicured lawn contains a small area with wooden poles and bars for stretching muscles.  An octagonal structure stands at the end of a small walkway, the rampart wall rising behind it.  The names of heroes continue in columns behind the structure on the polished basalt."
