    "A delicately-engraved ivory arch stretches across the far wall, its surface strewn with pure white iceblossoms.  An altar of deep red marble stands to the north, and a large statue of an entrancingly beautiful woman carved out of the soft pink walls gazes down upon it.  The woman is cast in a soft flickering light from the numerous pillar candles set in neatly-descending rows upon the edges of the altar, highlighting her stunning features further."
