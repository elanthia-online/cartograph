  "description": [
    "A mound of soft silken pillows has been placed casually upon the floor and the fluffy pile looks quite ready to be jumped into.  Each of the pillows is large and overfilled, and all of them bear a different pastel cover.  An intricate tin etching has been hung on one wall and bears the faintly smiling face of a lovely mermaid."
