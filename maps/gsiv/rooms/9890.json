    "A grove of linden trees grows almost to the banks of a large, pristine lake, its waters a shade of blue usually reserved for only the most beautiful of sapphires.  Here and there, drifts of fog rise from the mirror-smooth surface like wraiths twirling in a slow-motion dance.  Due north, on the lake's distant shore, stands an unusual building.  Three towers flank the domed structure, and drifting fog girds its striking configuration like a robe of mystery.",

Three towers flank the domed structure, and drifting fog girds its striking configuration like a robe of mystery."
