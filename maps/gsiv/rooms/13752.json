    "Plain wooden walls rise from an unfinished wooden floor.  Just above an elegantly woven reed mat hangs a trio-bladed mounted vellum fan, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  A damaged packing crate and a plain wooden table stand side by side in the middle of the room.",

Just above an elegantly woven reed mat hangs a trio-bladed mounted vellum fan, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  A cedar and oak footlocker and a plain wooden table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
