    "A collection of dwellings is tucked into the seclusion provided by a grove of chestnut trees to the north and a huge white birch screening the southern approach.  Their architectural style is somewhat primitive, although the high polish of the wooden logs used to build them testifies to their masterful construction.  While the ground is too rocky to support much in the way of gardens, the moonlit view of the surrounding valley and the shadowy forests covering the landscape more than compensate.",
