    "Patterns of phosphorescent white moss climb the arched walls of the cave, dangling down from the ceiling in ragged, glowing curtains just beyond a ragged cleft that serves as a cave mouth.  Golden radiance, brighter but less steady, beckons in a tireless dance from a hairpin bend leading further down into the earth.  The drip of water is faint but ever-present, echoing off of the slick walls in a whispering pattersong."
