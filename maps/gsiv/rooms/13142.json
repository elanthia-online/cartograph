    "Along the bend in the tunnel, a single giant luminescent toadstool has been placed.  The glowing fungus radiates a cheerful white light upon the nearby stone, illuminating the rough surface and casting strangely shaped shadows upon the walls and floor.  A strong scent of loam emanates from the toadstool's engraved bronze pot."
