    "A decorative linden branch wreath hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls, and a mosaic tiled ceiling rises overhead.  A fishscale blue mermaid figurine sits in one corner of a dark-stained oak floor.  There is a salt-stained warped fishing crate on one side of the shop and some warped driftwood shelves on the other."
