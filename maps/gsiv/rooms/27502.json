  "description": [
    "Lying along the edge of the plateau is the spine of some enormous sea creature, its monstrous ribcage resting on the debris-strewn path like an eerie ossified arcade.  The bones gleam a ghostly white in the moonlight, a faint echo of the life they once held.  A winding sandy trail descends into a jungle of new growth, disappearing as it passes a felled tree darkened with necrosis."
