  "description": [
    "Jaunty music floats through the air, emanating from somewhere beyond the ice-hewn walls.  Many swirls and loops in the ice give testimony to skaters giving in to the music.  Several penguin chicks have been painted on the icy wall, lending a whimsical, childish atmosphere to this section of the rink."
