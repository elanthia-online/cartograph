    "Unlit oil lamps hang in iron sconces along the smoke-stained walls of the low-ceilinged room.  Several tables and an oaken sideboard, bearing traces of the previous day's meals, are flanked by a long wooden bench and a few smaller chairs.  A leaded glass window, its dusty panes half-covered by filmy curtains, lets a little filtered light into the room, and a brick hearth smolders against the north wall.",
    "Tinted glass oil lamps hang from iron sconces, casting a dim glow over the smoke-stained walls of the low-ceilinged room.  Several tables and an oaken sideboard, bearing traces of the previous day's meals, are flanked by a long wooden bench and a few smaller chairs.  A leaded glass window, its dusty panes half-covered by filmy curtains, looks out on the dark street, and a brick hearth smolders against the north wall."
