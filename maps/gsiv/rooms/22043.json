    "A warm-hued, hardwood oak floor is polished to a lustrous glow, and matching thick ceiling supports frame a leaded crystal dome.  One wall, created entirely of intricately mortared pieces of flagstone, holds a massive fireplace with an oak mantelpiece.  Deep-cushioned wing chairs of wicker ring a small, cloth-covered table in one corner, and a four poster bed rests directly beneath the crystal dome.  A curtained archway leads to a balcony, and an alcove holds an indistinct shape in its recesses."
