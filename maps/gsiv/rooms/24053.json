    "An opulent, gentleman's haven greets you as you enter the private control center of the House.  Leather-bound books, oil paintings and sportsman's trophies line the walls, the stuffed head of a fearsome black shambler dominating the wall over a large couch.  Easy chairs surround a richly appointed desk under a window."
