    "Gigantic boulders have been scattered throughout the trees like pebbles, their shiny and damp surfaces covered with moss and lichen.  The thick haze plays tricks with the light and makes some of the more distant stones appear to be hulking giants ready to strike.  Weaving between the stony debris is a tiny stream that slowly flows to the east, its trickling barely heard over the sounds of the wildlife.  Tiny silver fish and tadpoles dart about within the stream, ceaseless in their movement."
