    "A tall cedar tree stands in the center of a patch of leafy ferns.  Dotted among the plants are several types of colorful flowers that seem to attract honey bees, as several of them dart among the blossoms.  A section of the ferns has been trampled to form a thin trail that winds its way toward the center of the circle of trees.",
