    "Against the far wall, a doorless wardrobe is pushed up against one side of a three-legged table to keep it from falling over.  A collection of hastily hastily nailed boards serves as a makeshift rack, which looks nearly ready to fall from where it is hooked to the wall.  An odd set of muddy footprints leads from a dirt-caked oak door and seems to disappear amongst the rest of the dirt covering the floor."
