    "As you step through the gate, you find yourself in a walled enclosure some one hundred yards square.  To the north is a massive hall with large oaken doors, and the sounds of livestock are coming from pens to the northeast.  There is a hut against the western wall of the Hall with tendrils of steam escaping from an opening in the roof."
