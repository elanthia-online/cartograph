    "Lining the side walls are ivory statues of elven figures, each firmly placed onto the floor lined with gold rugs.  The walls behind the ivory statues are painted white, except for the wall opposite of the door, which is a deep crimson.  In the corner of the room is a hammered gold anvil large enough to hold a myriad of items."
