  "description": [
    "The study is a circular chamber, its walls a darker shade of grey than the room above it.  However, the stone is as richly veined and polished.  One wall defies the curved sweep, its expanse flat to accommodate floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, filled with the pattern of color created by the leather-bound spines of countless books.  Two leather armchairs sit before a central fire pit.  The study's domed ceiling is ornamented with a mosaic depicting the night sky, bejeweled with its heavenly bodies."
