    "Rough oak walls climb to high wooden rafters in this stuffy, smoky room.  Several wall-candles provide dim illumination, revealing a sparsely decorated office.  A squat oak desk stands in the northeastern corner with an oak chair on either side, the only furnishings in the room.  A rank smell and odd sounds emanate from the western hallway, and muffled shuffling can be heard coming from the door on the northern wall."
