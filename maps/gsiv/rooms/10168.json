    "Uncommonly wide, the pass appears to be able to accommodate the girth of an army, though some of the ruts in the dirt trail are by no means fresh and signal that more peaceful era has passed.  Crowded trees filled with singing birds hug both sides and extend back farther than the eye can see."
