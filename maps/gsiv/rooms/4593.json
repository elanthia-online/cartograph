    "An intricately carved oak desk, which is trimmed in coraesine metal, dominates this room.  The wood trim of a high-backed leather chair has been inlaid with an assortment of crushed pink and blue coquina shells, and is twisted sideways to the desk.  The wall opposite the desk has a mural of a map depicting the geography of the early Turamzzyr Empire.  Hanging from metal supports in the walls is an assemblage of various weapons of war."
