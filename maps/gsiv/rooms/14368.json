    "Squashed between the shop's tall walls and a three-story townhouse is a courtyard covered in creeping ivy.  Granite cobblestones cover the uneven floor, their greyed surfaces displaying signs of regular bleaching.  Dyeing stalls are built into the eastern and western walls, while a stone washbasin fitted with a cast iron pump rests to the north.  A sturdy whitewashed door is framed in solid oak, its long sides holding in place a pulley system that supports a labyrinth of clotheslines."
