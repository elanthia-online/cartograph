    "Scorch marks and soot stain the canvas near a small workbench in one corner of this modest shop.  An intricate contraption hangs from the ridgepole.  A confusing jumble of polished brass mirrors and gears, the contraption serves to magnify light from a single oil lamp and focus it on a single display case in the center of the area."
