    "White pine tables, gracefully simple, stand against the grey stone walls.  Baskets of trinkets and other decorative fairings sparkle atop the tables.  Above the tables and their wares are iron brackets bearing candles to light the room.  Pink bows are tied to several of the brackets, softening their austere appearance."
