    "The room is a haven of chaos.  A sad attempt at shelves hangs from the back wall, with oddities like bits of rope, broken swords, half a table, and other things you cannot identify stored in every dirty nook and cranny.  Even the spider spinning a web in the corner looks disgusted at the mess."
