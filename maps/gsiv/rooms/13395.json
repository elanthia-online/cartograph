    "A variety of ebon-topped tables are placed comfortably about the room, each surrounded by a grouping of lush velvet-padded chairs.  Several arched windows look out onto the sunlit plaza to the west, the statue at its center cast in a haze of liquid gold as the sun chases the shadows of passing clouds away every few moments.  An especially large, dark crimson couch lines the western wall, its overstuffed cushions offering a peaceful haven to gaze out upon the world.",
    "A variety of ebon-topped tables are placed comfortably about the room, each surrounded by a grouping of lush velvet-padded chairs.  Several arched windows look out onto the dark plaza to the west, the statue at its center cast in a pearlescent haze of pale sapphire as the starlight mingles with the shadows of passing clouds away every few moments.  An especially large, dark crimson couch lines the western wall, its overstuffed cushions offering a peaceful haven to gaze out upon the moonlit world."
