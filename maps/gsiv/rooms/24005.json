    "A tiny break in the thick emerald boughs high overhead permits a patch of bright golden sunlight to stream downward onto the path.  Glistening dust motes dance in the sunlight, fading into nothingness as they pass into the shadows beyond.  Dappled in shadow is a white marble statue sitting amidst a bed of black roses.",
    "A tiny break in the darkened boughs high overhead permits a beam of cool silvery moonlight to stream downward onto the path.  Shimmering fireflies dance through the shadows beneath the trees, their golden lamps dimming as they flit through the ray of moonlight.  Glowing softly in the moonlight is a white marble statue sitting amidst a bed of black roses."
