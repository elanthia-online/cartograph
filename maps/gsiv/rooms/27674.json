    "Here, on the southern wall, evenly spaced half-globe-encased torches bathe the space in flickering golden light.  Directly opposite stands a very long cedar counter tucked into a recessed curving wall lit by numerous torches on either side.  The services offered at this counter seem to be in demand, as individuals periodically queue up to speak with the clerk behind it."
