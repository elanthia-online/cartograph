    "Pleasant hints of lavender and sandalwood float lightly in the air of the neatly kept backroom.  The space is arranged very simply with emphasis placed on a swan-carved ebonwood armoire set against the back wall.  Pointedly fixed at either side of the glaes-framed doorway is a white silk-lined shelf and a two-tiered black oak stand.",
