    "One wall of this room holds two large murals, one of the city defenses, and one of the shores of Maelstrom Bay, dotted with forts and settlements.  A large sand table holds lead figurines in warlike poses, and six small wooden ships.  The far wall is dominated by a huge stone fireplace.  A third wall has a silver inlay of the seal of the Council of Mages."
