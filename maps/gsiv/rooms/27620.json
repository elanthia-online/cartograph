  "description": [
    "The old abandoned temple appears to have been deserted for quite some time.  Several wrotwood trees have grown into the structure, shattering windows and destorying walls.  Dust-laden pews are the only remnants that resemble a place of worship, no other holy trinkets are recognizable in the debris.  Through several broken floorboards is a passageway leading down, surrounding by swamp water.  From outside, a powerful rift wavers around the structure."
