    "The gallery is engirdled in sheer walls of carved glacial ice, and bright light emanates from behind them.  Ripples of power pass over the ice, keeping it frozen solid but maintaining a moderate room temperature.  A quartet of aquamarine marble colonnades close to the entrance serves as nothing more than decoration.  Though traffic through the wide arches dividing the wings is unimpeded, a towering crystal ice elemental statue and a void black glaes vaespilon sculpture guard the east and west wings, while a display of ancient halfling armor set on an oak stand is poised eternally on watch at the south."
