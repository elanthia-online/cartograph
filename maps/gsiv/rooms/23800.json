  "description": [
    "The courtyard extends into a rather grubby stretch of land liberally punctuated with banners, flags, and hand-painted signs that invite festival goers to sample every delight the retreat has to offer.  An insufficient amount of straw has been trampled into the muddy ground creating a slippery walkway through the maze of merchant stalls."
