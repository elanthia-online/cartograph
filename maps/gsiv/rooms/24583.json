    "The wagon's interior walls bear a high gloss resultant of meticulous polishing and attentive care.  Luminous brass lanterns hang from the heavy struts overhead, shedding a warm amber light perfumed with vanilla in pools across the area.  Opposite the entry, a tall chest sits, and one of its drawers has been left open, with a small parchment note hanging from its golden pull.  Against a side wall is a rack that stands across from a full-length brass-framed mirror, and between the two is a door leading out."
