    "Massive tree trunks to either side of the trail rise up like columns in a grand, but ruinous temple.  The soft carpet of leaves on the forest floor and the mist which obscures them muffles all sound, and without any landmarks it would be easy to become lost and wander forever amidst the giant oaks.",

The soft carpet of leaves on the forest floor and the mist which obscures them muffles all sound, and without any landmarks it would be easy to become lost and wander forever amidst the giant oaks."
