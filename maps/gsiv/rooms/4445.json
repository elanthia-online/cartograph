    "In braces of dark iron, torches frame the entryway, giving off the heavy scent of tar along with a wavering wash of tawny light.  Largely bare, the rough-hewn walls are vacant except for the back wall, which is lined with large mithril hooks set on a long plank of beveled-edge maoral.  Mannequins stand on each side of the hooks, displaying the proper use of the wares."
