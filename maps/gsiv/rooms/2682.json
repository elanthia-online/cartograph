    "A small ledge marks the end of a poor excuse for a trail, which winds down the mountainside to the northwest.  Snow flurries keep the way pristine with a slick coating.  Overhead, low clouds conceal everything beyond a close pocket of vision, however, another small ledge is visible within climbing distance."
