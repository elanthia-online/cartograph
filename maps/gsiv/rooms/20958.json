    "Just inside the canopied green forest, it looks and feels like a completely different world compared to the open grassy foothills just a few steps away.  The foliage is so thick, the sky cannot be seen.  Due to the complete blockage of the sun, the temperature inside the forest is much cooler than the nearby hills."
