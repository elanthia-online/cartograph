    "Moonlight glitters upon cobblestones lining a small pathway that ambles through the rich foliage to and from a small farmhouse.  Butterflyweed, bright lavender and deep burgundy in hue, creates dark shadows against the brightness of the home, while glaesine bowls holding honey and nectar hang from a nearby umbrella tree.  Luna moths cavort about the area, their wings pale green and white.",

Butterflyweed, bright lavender and deep burgundy in hue, stands out against the bright paint of the home and holds court with several winged beauties, while glaesine bowls holding honey and nectar hang from a nearby umbrella tree."
