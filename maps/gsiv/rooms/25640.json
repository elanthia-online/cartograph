    "Moonlight glitters upon cobblestones lining a small pathway that ambles through the rich foliage to and from a small farmhouse.  Butterflyweed, bright lavender and deep burgundy in hue, creates dark shadows against the brightness of the home, while glaesine bowls holding honey and nectar hang from a nearby umbrella tree.  Luna moths cavort about the area, their wings pale green and white.",
