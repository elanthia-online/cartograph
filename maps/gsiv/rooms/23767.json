    "Branching in either direction, the long stone corridor arches outward in a slow curve about the area that is visible up a set of stone steps, a large steel suit of armor standing to either side.  Carved into the stone overhead is the word, \"DUSKRUIN\".  Another smaller dark passageway angles downward toward the bowels of the arena."
