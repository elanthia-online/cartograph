  "description": [
    "Dominating a circular expanse of raised stone surrounded by a small plaza, a sculpted slick stone portal worked into the shape of twining bodies casts sickening radiance upon the surroundings.  The portal occupies the tallest plateau in a vast underground chasm.  Warm, moist air blankets the area heavily, stinking oppressively of mildew and old rot."
