    "Blue-painted lengths of modwir lumber are laid flat to form the surface of the dock.  Tall, rounded maoral posts line the dock, and a pair of large wrought-iron rings is bolted to the moorings.  A small rowboat is tied up to one of the wrought-iron rings and is surrounded by several whitewashed pedal boats."
