  "description": [
    "The hall ends here with a single swinging door to the east.  Mouthwatering smells waft out each time a member of the wait staff swings the portal open, coaxing a reflexive growl from your stomach.  A loud, energetic bellowing voice echoes through the corridor, issuing instructions for food preparation and presentation that rival the orders of any military commander.  To the west opens a graceful archway, framed in engraved wood."
