    "A black basalt obelisk is imbedded in the hilltop and stands as a shadow against the night sky.  Just to the west, at the very crest of the hill, rises a circular tower of granite blocks.  Thick clusters of clover dot the grassy hillside and sprout along the faint path that descends around the hill to the south.",

Thick clusters of clover dot the grassy hillside and sprout along the faint path that descends around the hill to the south."
