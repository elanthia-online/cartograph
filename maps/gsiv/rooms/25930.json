    "A heavy rug covers the majority of the knotted wood floor.  A large, bulky chair sits near a simple square table, above which hangs a neatly framed sign.  A single window lets the moonlight in, filtered though it is through the many trees surrounding the cottage.  The light casts shifting shadows upon the darkly stained door."
