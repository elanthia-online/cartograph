    "Nebulous, ethereal light trickles from the pulsing arcane dome above, its protective shielding keeping the air cool, but clear and crisp.  Crystals of frost form along the golden tiles that are closest to the energy wall, their glossy faces limned in its pale blue glow.  Darkness spreads its tenebrous touch upon the horizon, lightening towards the north but deepening to the south, and displays the stars of the northern skies like tiny jewels lost in black silk."
