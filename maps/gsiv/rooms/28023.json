    "A wagon filled with sawdust is parked in the middle of the road, its driver nowhere in sight.  A small group of children astride stick horses brandish aspen branches streaming royal blue banderoles, laughing and shouting as they charge at each other in turn.  A line of merchant stalls along one side of the road appear to have recently been afire, the scorched aspen wood still smoldering."
