  "description": [
    "The stone walls of this level of the tower are badly cracked, with many of the gaps opening wide enough to offer views of the courtyard below.  Evenly spaced cross-shaped arrow slits mingle with the gaping fissures on the southern wall.  Several rusted and rotting weapon racks lean against the remaining walls.  Large arches leading out onto the southern wall are open to the east and west."
