  "description": [
    "Painted wooden wagons large enough for up to three children are lined up against the manor's exterior wall, as though someone were opening a livery.  Chalk drawings in pastels and white have turned the plank flooring into a grand gallery of puppies, kittens, ponies, and a parade of small blue spheres marching across the floor."
