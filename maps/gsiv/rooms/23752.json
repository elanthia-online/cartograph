    "The back of the shop has been decorated marginally more than the front room but still lacks any flashy or ornate enhancements.  Delicate, candle-filled sconces provide the majority of lighting, while a recessed, double-paned window allows the moonlight to bathe the mannequins in warm, natural glow.  A doorway leads back into the men's section of the shop.",
