    "Dark marble columns ascend toward the arched ceiling, their golden capitals formed into the shape of large, spread claws.  Crossed slashes form a ragged, interlinked pattern across the walls, the gouges in the marble quite deep.  A simple velvet rug of crimson leads further north toward a dark, circular chamber."
