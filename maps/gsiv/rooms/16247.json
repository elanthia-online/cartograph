    "The long corridor's length is marked by the pools of light cast by distinctive lanterns.  Halflings amble along passing through the successive spotlights, their voices animated and high-pitched.  A faint odor of brewing mead alternates with that of baking pastries, carried on a breeze which plays through the tunnels."
