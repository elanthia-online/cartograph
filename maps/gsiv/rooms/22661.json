    "Brilliant white string moss drapes heavily across the branches of several of the nearby cypress trees, effectively clogging their limbs and strangling their meager attempts to gain nutrients through photosynthesis.  Stretching upward at the base of each arboreal giant are clusters of tall wildyre that is mingled with feathery, fiddlehead ferns.  A thin rivulet of almost clear water twists a serpentine path in and out of the tufts of grass only to disappear into a channel that leads deep into the ground."
