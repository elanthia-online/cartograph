    "The walls down here are of fitted stone, with a bowl-shaped niche built into the north wall at about waist high.  The niche is full of water, a trickle of which is overflowing the bowl and puddling on the floor.  Hairy molds and bulbous fungus grow across the walls, while the floor is slippery with slime."
