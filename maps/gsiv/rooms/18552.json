    "A wagon has been left here, out of the way and off of the main road through town.  It doesn't appear to be disabled and is tied to a hitching post.  Great heaps of straw fill the wagon, stalks sticking out from beneath a plaid blanket spread across them to keep the wind from carrying them away.  Some of the straw, however, has fallen from the open gate on the back of the wagon to pile on the ground."
