    "Set upon a tripod of brass, a long telescope is positioned towards the heavens and is the focal point of this small clearing.  Several charts designating various celestial bodies and their positions in the heavens are pinned to the riverstone cottage's wall, while someone has tacked a rough schedule of classes to the door.  A slender track leads away from the clearing towards the Lore Circle."
