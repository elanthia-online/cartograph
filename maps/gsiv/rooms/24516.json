    "Hidden behind a wall of wooden crates, this obviously neglected corner of the cottage attic is festooned with cobwebs and dust.  Dried bits of leaves are scattered across the floorboards like confetti.  Smeared scuff marks along the baseboard of one slanted wall lead toward a narrow, twisted opening between the crates."
