    "A large chamber stretches away into gloomy shadows, its ceiling high above and lost to sight in the murk.  The vivid slab floor is tinted a deep scarlet, and all across it, ragged fingers of fog drift with seemingly aimless nonchalance.  On the southern wall, a tunnel opens and into its mouth pour the floor tiles, like a ruby rivulet of liquid stone seeping into a sieve."
