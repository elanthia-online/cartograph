    "The broad sweep of the hardwood floor is interrupted by an elegantly dressed maiden statue.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the mahogany paneled walls.  A long brass clothing rack and a gilded maple cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
