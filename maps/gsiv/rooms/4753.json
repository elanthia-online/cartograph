    "An outcropping of granite, striated with twisting veins, protrudes from the leaf-strewn forest floor, its pale hulk glimmering like polished bone in the low light.  Small clusters of lichen, like dry barnacles, cling to the stone surface, their lime-colored blooms forming strange patterns on the rock.  A subtle scent, like the damp odor associated with upturned soil, permeates the area.",
