    "The high modwir-beamed ceiling gives the bar an expansive feel and ivy growing through cutouts in the window frames climbs along trellises affixed to the walls.  Woven rattan chairs are grouped informally around circular tables.  Potted mint plants atop each table are unusual, but highly practical substitutes for the more common cut flowers."
