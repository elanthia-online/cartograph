    "A dark walnut dining table with fluted legs runs down the center of the room, its richly grained surface set with pewter plates and bone-handled silver cutlery.  A crystal-hung candelabra casts rippling shadows over the stained oak floor.  Hung over the fireplace is a tranquil landscape painting in an ornate silver frame."
