    "A steep climb of eroded landscape fringed with exposed tree roots makes for a perilous journey in either vertical direction, which is probably why the lighter moonlit path edging the encrouching forest looks well used.  Thin and young at the leading edge, sparse stands of beech and mulberry merge with thicker groves of mature oaks, with only the occasional thin beam striking down through the leafy canopy.",

Thin and young at the leading edge, sparse stands of beech and mulberry merge with thicker groves of mature oaks, cutting down the interior visibility with a distinct darkness."
