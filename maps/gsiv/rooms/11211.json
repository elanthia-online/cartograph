    "The smiths in this room were responsible for repairing the garrison's armor.  An iron cauldron is suspended over a fire pit beside the large forge.  Several small anvils and a variety of shaping hammers are scattered on the ground.  The cauldron contains a residual coating of tar.  Some old leather and a scattering of metal studs and rings lie on the floor."
