    "Soft layers of green-dyed angora wool cover the bottom half of the shop walls, the fabric pinned by a plethora of vibrant silken blossoms and stalks of grass.  Hanging from the blue-painted ceiling are several thin wires, the metal lengths suspending a large yellow glass orb, as well as fluffy bundles of white rolton fur serving as makeshift clouds."
