    "Moving along the smooth wood of the building, the walkway ends at a bench recessed in a nook carved into the wall.  Several flowering bushes grow to either side of the secluded area screening the area from the rest of the atrium.  Thick vines drape down from above creating a curtain of colorful blossoms and greenery."
