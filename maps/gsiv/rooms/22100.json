    "The narrow staircase pauses at a landing where the stairs crook around a curve.  To the northeast, an arch takes the place of the carved panels decorating the other walls.  A pair of bas-relief masks hangs on the lintel of the arch, one with an exaggerated grin and the other a tragic grimace."
