    "The path beneath the trees is soft with mud and moss.  Deep foot and hoof prints mark the passage of both people and animals that have traveled through the woods.  Something has dug a hole in the ground near one of the trees, piling earth and leaves along the edge of a curved root in a high mound that brings to mind a rampart surrounding a castle."
