  "description": [
    "An outdoor forge adds unwelcomed heat to the already oppressive humidity.  A rack of iron tools sits between two black gum trees, and some long-handled bellows hang suspended beside the stone forge.  Rounded wooden casks are topped off with water, and a small shed rests beneath the boughs of the trees."
