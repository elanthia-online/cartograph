  "description": [
    "A grouping of darkly varnished chairs form a semi-circle around an elegant cast iron stove topped with a tall black cast iron kettle.  Beside the stove but separated by a few feet is a small wicker chest, its lid open to reveal its contents.  The heady scent of freshly brewed coffee permeates the air, mixed with the stale, sour scent of spilled liquor."
