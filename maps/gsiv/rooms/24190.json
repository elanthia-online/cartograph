    "A colonnade of giant, misshapen figures stand poised with raised appendages supporting the enormous chamber's cathedral-arched ceiling.  Besides abyran'sa and vathor, there are paired columns sculpted in at least half a dozen other demonic species.  Raised on a dais to the southwest, a massive stone altar is clearly visible."
