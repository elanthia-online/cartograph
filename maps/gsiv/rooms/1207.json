    "The trail winds through the trees, lights and shadows dancing between the branches.  To the north, your path is blocked by the trunk of a huge fallen modwir.  Wicked looking black brambles climb over the trunk and wind through the branches, except for a patch right above the trail.  The exposed surface of the bark has been worn smooth."
