    "Glossy mistwood walls rise from a dark-stained oak floor.  Just above a mound of silk-covered pillows hangs a blue watered silk tapestry, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  An elegant silver jewelry rack and a set of carved felwood shelves stand side by side in the middle of the room."
