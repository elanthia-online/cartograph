    "Colorful pennants fly along the raceway, comical roltons painted upon each one.  A wide red ribbon is stretched across the track, each end tied to the post of a split-rail fence.  A large colorful awning can be seen to the west, its bright material drawing attention to the starting line and a view of the large barn wall."
