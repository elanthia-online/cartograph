  "description": [
    "Silver hooks, polished and bright, adorn the walls of the large coatroom, many occupied by a variety of overwear, from shawls and longcoats to trapper's furs.  A series of narrow diamond-shaped windows high up on the southern wall lets in icy moonlight that cuts through the thin haze of woodsmoke in the air.  Several attendants stand at the ready to assist guests with their traveling garb, smartly dressed in attire accented with frost blue and pale silver flourishes."
