    "The hall comes to an end at the base of a huge sandstone spire, its second story balcony overlooking the regal disarray of the columned walk.  A gauze-wrapped corpse dangles from the balcony's edge, suspended from a length of black cord.  Still swinging, the corpse fixes the structure's entrance with a filmy, sightless stare."
