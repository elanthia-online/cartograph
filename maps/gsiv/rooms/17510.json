  "description": [
    "Peering down the snow-covered hill, a natural obstacle course of trees and other shrubbery dots the landscape.  Meandering through the trees are several rutted paths devoid of snow.  Some of the trails end abruptly at the bases of trees, where the debris of shattered shields still litters the ground.  A makeshift awning constructed from pieces of wood with canvas pulled tightly over its surface protects the piles of shields from inclement weather.  On the edge of the slope rests a long table and chair."
