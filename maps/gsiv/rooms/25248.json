    "To the north, a narrow opening breaks the curve of the walls, proceeding toward an alcove lit by a furious inferno of emerald radiance.  Shadows race and dance at the verges of the wide bar of light it leaves pooling on the floor, curling about the edges of a circular bronze seal set into the sandstone.  Overhead, the ceiling is patterned with gleaming copper scales."
