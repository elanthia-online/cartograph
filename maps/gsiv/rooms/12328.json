    "Golden linden crown molding encircles the sprawling bedroom and separates the pale blue walls from the pure white ceiling.  Draped in sapphire, the canopy bed is flanked by nightstands topped with pillar candles, while a small table with twin armchairs rests near a triple-tiered mahogany dry sink.  A paneled golden linden door that leads to the hallway beyond is painted with a vibrant mural and stands at the opposite end of the room from glass-paned doors that open out onto a balcony."
