    "Swathes of grey and violet fabric overlap to create a domed pavilion that has air vents high in its ceiling.  Polished lacquered supports are wrapped in copper chains that bind the layers of the walls together, while conical censers fill the air with tropical fragrances that stave off the less savory aromas of the swamp.  A large, felt-backed panel displays a variety of wares in the center of the room."
