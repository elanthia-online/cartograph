  "description": [
    "Mist enhances the thick, musty scent of decaying leaves and rotting logs as the jungle terrain surrenders to the swampy environment.  Vegetation is sparse, and what few shrubs and spindly trees remain frame a narrow trail to the west.  The sounds of wildlife are subtle here, with only a few husks of snake skins and the occasional screech of a bird as evidence that they still occupy the area.  Travel is difficult through the slurping mud, and small pockets of murky water bubble in the humidity."
