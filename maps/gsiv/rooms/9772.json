    "Constricted with roots and moss hanging from ceiling and walls, the tunnel is hazardous and cloaked with shadow.  Clay and dirt combine to form an uneven floor, and a large boulder composed of granite and alexandrite has cracked and fallen across the tunnel in great shards.  It creates a twisted obstacle course in the already congested labyrinth."
