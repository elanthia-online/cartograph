    "A scraggly tree struggles to grow through a broken boulder resting on the edge of the low cliff to the north, a monument to tenacity.  Though it hangs at such a steep angle that it looks dangerously close to falling over, the tree's strong roots keep it steady.  The narrow trail continues up the steep slope to the east, though its markings in the rocky soil are growing more faint."
