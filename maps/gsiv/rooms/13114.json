  "description": [
    "Sparse and utilitarian, the office is arranged to utilize the most space possible without causing overcrowding.  Two desks are pushed together, one large and the other small, while a series of wooden chairs are set in a ring about them.  The entire eastern wall is covered a bookcase that is heavy with scrolls, books, tomes, and the occasional odd artifact, which is kept under a protective glass."
