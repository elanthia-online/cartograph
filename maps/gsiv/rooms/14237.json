    "Candle flames dance in myriad alcoves spaced about the curved eastern end of the narthex.  Beneath a ceiling patterned in gold-inlaid white birch stands the polished sculpture of a scholarly man just past his middle years.  Lit from behind, the statue casts a long shadow down the large, high-ceilinged hall."
