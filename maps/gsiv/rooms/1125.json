    "Only the slightest bit of forest is present.  A few hardy elms cling to the dry soil, looking rather stunted, and grassy weeds cover much of the available ground.  A crumbly cliff approximately twelve feet high runs north and south.  Its face presents no solid handholds for climbing.  To the southeast the land rises steeply onto some barren scrub hills, while to the northeast the forest becomes thicker."
