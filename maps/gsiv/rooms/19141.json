    "One large brass oil lamp, aft, supplies light for the entire cabin.  A single ironwood counter extends from bulkhead to bulkhead, separating customers from salespeople.  Squat, wide, and heavily polished, a freestanding ironwood cabinet resides in front of the counter, displaying merchandise for the discerning buyer.  Behind the counter, salespeople bustle noisily about, and, in the far corner, a halfling frowns over an immense stack of ledgers."
