  "description": [
    "Towering stone shelves have been formed into the very walls of the room, each one occupied by dozens of leather-bound tomes and thick volumes.  Attached to the corners of every book is a mithril chain, keeping the manuscripts never far from their respective spots.  Two slate-topped round tables are positioned in the center of the room, each brightly illuminated by a glowing glaes orb positioned in the ceiling above."
