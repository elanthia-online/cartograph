    "Shelves line the walls of the booth.  Sitting on them are a number of statues, knick-knacks and antique children's toys.  In the center is a large articulated zombie puppet, leaning back against the wall.  Although his face is meant to be carved as fierce, it looks more paranoid about the creatures surrounding him.  A thanot table stands in the center of the nook."
