    "Dark patches in the ice pack hint at deep holes underneath, and some of the flagstones have broken apart where the permafrost shattered from the heavy weights travelling over it.  Frozen ruts filled with sludge thrown from wagons and heavy sleds lend further to the heavy gray color of the top layer of snow lining the roadway.  The picket fences standing further back from the road are a much lighter color, having avoided much of the dirt thrown back from passing traffic."
