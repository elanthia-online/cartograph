    "Lapis lazuli bands traverse the icy blue granite walls, the inlay forming a spiraling effect that ascends from the high ceiling to the smooth floor.  Lidless jars, hung aloft by golden chains, house hundreds of fireflies, which create a soft glow of light at all times of day and night in the small chamber.  To the southwest, a round window is framed with blue opal cabochons, while the center is filled with an ascending and descending staircase."
