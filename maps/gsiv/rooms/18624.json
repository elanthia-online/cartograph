    "Looking more like an altar than a surface for practice of the alchemical research, the top of the workbench is carved from a block of solid black marble and stands on an elevated platform in the center of this triangular room.  Crystal prisms, set into the walls near the room's apex, splinter daylight into its constituent colors while channeling it into a faceted orb that glows brightly above the workbench.  Staggered shelving on each wall holds assorted items of interest.",
