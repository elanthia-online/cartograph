  "description": [
    "Calm yet varied pastels give the room a warm and peaceful feeling.  Light golden, birch paneling compliments the powder blue carpet and peach bedspread.  The ceiling, painted an eggshell white, supports a gleaming brass-and-walnut chandelier.  The chandelier's steadily burning candles cast a soft light to increase the room's cozy feeling.  The spacious bed's birch headboard matches the paneling well, and two birch end tables nestle against the wall and flank the bed on either side."
