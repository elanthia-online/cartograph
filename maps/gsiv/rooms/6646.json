    "Five long tables, a row of chairs to either side of each, dominate this room waiting for someone to sit down and take their place at them.  A dozen cast iron chandeliers hang from the ceiling with a multitude of small candles casting their light down upon the room.  A large serving table runs the length of the west wall, while a pair of swinging doors leads to the north, and a smaller black modwir door leads to the south."
