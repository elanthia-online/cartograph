    "An air of silence pervades this spacious shop, not even the squeak of a patron's shoe on the marble floors defying this stillness. Rows of assorted doors are set in the center of the large room, displayed on tall stands and arranged like a miniature labyrinth. An old and cantankerous elf leans against a counter in the back, keeping a close eye on those in her shop."
