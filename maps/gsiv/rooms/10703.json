    "A sea of grey soil spreads eastward from this point.  Not far ahead, a pair of parallel walls begin to cut through the night.  The bleached material forming the wall is smooth like polished bone.  Watching like tireless sentinels, a pair of humanoid skulls cap the ends of the walls.  Small candles burn inside the skulls, giving the area an orange tint.",
