    "A flight of steps has been carved into the face of the cliff, winding up its face in a dizzy ascent.  A handrail follows its progress, with torches stuck into the cliff wall lighting the way.  Nearby, a finger of rock sprouts from the canyon floor and lifts toward the sky like an igneous flower following the moon's beckoning.  High above, on top of the column where it flares amid low clouds, the outline of a large structure can barely be glimpsed.",
    "A flight of steps has been carved into the face of the cliff, winding up its face in a dizzy ascent.  A handrail follows its progress, growing more faint and tenuous as it climbs.  Nearby, a finger of rock sprouts from the canyon floor and lifts toward the sky like an igneous flower following the sun's beckoning.  High above, on top of the column where it flares amid low clouds, the outline of a large structure can be glimpsed."
