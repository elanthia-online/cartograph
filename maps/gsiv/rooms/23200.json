  "description": [
    "The airy room is bordered by irregular walls of rough-cut modwir planks and strips, nailed together into a sturdy, if inelegant, whole.  Piercing opposite sides are several high-set windows, partially shuttered with teak slats.  Underneath one window is a wide-bellied terra cotta stove with an enameled tea kettle sitting on top.  Alongside the stove is a small woodbox holding kindling and split logs, next to which is a large oak-topped butcher's block.  Haphazardly attached to the walls is a series of warped cupboards."
