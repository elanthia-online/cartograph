    "Cool, damp air lingers with the taste of salt, imbued by the mineral rocks of the floor, walls, and ceiling.  This small cave opens up into a much larger cavern which is home to a dark brine lake, frequented by boaters and fishermen.  A steel-braced archway leads toward the main arteries of Zul Logoth."
