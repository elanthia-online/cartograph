    "The cul-de-sac is dominated by the ornate bridge arching overhead.  Beneath it, a cluster of houses grow like mushrooms at the foot of the pilings, every square foot of ground around them planted with flowering gardens.  Honeysuckle vines climb the ladder of the bridge's underpinnings,  spicing the air with their sweet perfume."
