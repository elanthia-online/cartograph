    "Sturdy wooden planks support the cramped quarters' walls.  With candles shedding just enough light to illuminate a large sign, the area's combination of dim lighting, low ceiling, and rugged granite floor creates a marked lack of space in the cavern.  Faded tapestries cover the walls, their weaves depicting a variety of scenes in which dwarves are hunting and gathering a multitude of skins."
