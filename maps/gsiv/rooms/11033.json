    "The waterfall violently empties into the Tempest River here, tossing up billowing clouds of water vapor.  The moonlight glints off each individual droplet, filling the air with dancing pulses of light.  One might think it relaxing if it weren't for the deafening roar of the waterfall filling your ears.  Peeking out from behind the falls you see some stone steps carved into the face of the cliff, leading upward to the plateau above.  A road also follows alongside the river to the southwest.",
