    "The misshapen archway opens up to a surprisingly large space within the trunk of the tree.  Off to one side is a tall sturdy reed basket, and on the opposite wall is a long shelf.  Sconces have been carved into the walls, and a large pillar candle rests on each, providing soft flickering light."
