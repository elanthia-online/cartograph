    "This large meeting hall is oblong in plan, with a high central barrel-vault ceiling lit by a clerestory.  Between each window of the clerestory is a massive marble pillar, six on each side of the room.  A wide aisle parts rows of high-backed wooden benches and leads down to the central podium."
