  "description": [
    "The bones gravitate slowly down from the west, their movement imperceptible.  A sheer granite wall blocks the flow of bones from proceeding eastward, diverting them instead to the north and south.  A temperate wind blows through the area, generally following the flow of bones in from the west and moving out to the north.  As the wind moves across the field of dry bones, the skeletal pieces suck the moisture out of the air, leaving it to course along as an arid, intermittent breeze."
