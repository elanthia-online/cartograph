    "Beautiful gold sconces adorn both sides of the doorway in this quaint little shop.  A frosted glass cabinet, resting in the center of the royal-blue carpeting, holds an assortment of beautiful glass figurines.  An elegant emerald-green tapestry with gold stitching covers the wall above the fireplace.  Emptied of its cargo, a fair-sized gold chest lies on its side.  Its contents have been strewn haphazardly on the floor behind the counter.",
    "An overwhelming stench of smoke fills the shop.  The remains of a a frosted-glass cabinet stand in the center of the room, the contents broken into piles of colorful glass dust.  The pawnbroker stands behind a makeshift counter of two crates and a scorched length of floor planking, trying desperately to pretend that everything is perfectly normal.",
    "The stone walls are clean, but bare, and a simple woven wool carpet covers the wooden floor planks.  The pawnbroker stands behind a long counter, rows of tall shelves stretching behind him laden with a broad assortment of weapons, armor, potions, and trinkets, each meticulously labeled and catalogued.  A small trashcan stands against a side wall."
