  "description": [
    "Dipping beyond the edge of the western horizon, the bright red star of The Hammer is just barely visible as it prepares to leave the skies of Elanthia for another year.  The dim glow of the incarnadine celestial body tints the nearby lunar landscape in a soft pink hue, while the distant sound of an anvil being struck by a hammer rolls across the basin.  As if in accord with the out of place sound, a nearby glass-lined ring pulses in response."
