  "description": [
    "The ground drops off sharply to the north and northwest, creating a small cliff of dirt and rock.  Far below you can hear the sounds of water falling, but the actual falls are obscured by a thick layer of fog.  A few tenacious bramble bushes cling to the steep face, but the trees have all toppled downwards with the earth."
