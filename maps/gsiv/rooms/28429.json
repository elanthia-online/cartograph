    "The dreary hollow is littered with crumbling misty grey stonework, though the walls are fairly sound compared to the jagged, uneven flooring.  Sunrays pour through a corner opening onto an iron-bound leather chest, the brightness quelled by feathery tufts of errant cobwebs.  Shadowy rivulets of water blossom from glowing fungi that sprout from fragmented cracks surrounding a high-placed ledge."
