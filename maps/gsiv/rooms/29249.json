  "description": [
    "The length of the upper platform is lined with copper railings that separate the elevated space from the drop-off to the exhibit halls below.  Coordinating pedestals, their bases set with plaques, are scattered here and there, and a few glass cases dot the open area.  The wooden floor is worn shiny at the foot of a walkway leading from one side of the upper platform to the other.  An equally burnished patch of flooring is directly in front of a tiled copper arch leading outside."
