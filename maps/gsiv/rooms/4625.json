    "Lilac bushes burdened with dark purple blossoms line the low walls of this small garden, sirenflowers and lavender filling the beds around them.  Standing in front of several fan-shaped trellises laden with fragrant passionflower vines, a bronze statue of a cloaked woman faces all who enter.  A boulder bearing a brass plaque rests at her feet."
