  "description": [
    "The sounds of the city lapse into soft, muted versions of their former selves.  The world disappears in swaths of pale crimson and deep violet as thin leaves swirl past in a haze, the magnolia trees weeping forth a constant stream of the leafy teardrops with every strong current of wind.  The stone facade of the manor looms to the north, its intricate, curved architecture wrought with arcing designs of silver."
