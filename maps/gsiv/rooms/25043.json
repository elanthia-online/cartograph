    "A quartet of burlap training dummies line the far stone wall, each crudely painted with a target upon the front.  Thin rivulets of sand leak from several of the bags, mixing into the puddles of blood and mud covering the floor.  The makeshift head of each dummy has been removed by various means, some decapitated by blade, while others seem to have been gnawed away."
