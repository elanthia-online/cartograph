  "description": [
    "Exposed rafters stretch across the ceiling, their thick lengths laden with incredibly tiny copper lanterns and thick bundles of ribbon-wrapped larkspur.  Moonstone cabochons have been forced into the ebonwood walls at various heights and create the image of multiple constellations scattered about the room.  Though tidy, the room houses only a large pile of sleeping furs in one corner and a large sea grass basket in another."
