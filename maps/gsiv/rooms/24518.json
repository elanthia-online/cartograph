    "The hexagonal shaped room is enclosed with large panes of glass on five sides and has a domed ceiling made of smaller glass panes, carefully fitted together.  Lush foliage and tropical flowers decorate the room, adding to the illusion of being outdoors.  Most noteable are the orchids in shades of white, pink, blue, lavender and green.  Amid the flora and fauna comfortably cushioned rattan furniture has been placed to provide seating without disturbing the serenity of the room."
