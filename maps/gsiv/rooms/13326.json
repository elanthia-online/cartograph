    "Following the gentle swell of a hill, a cobbled walk skirts a wooded grove that surrounds a charming bungalow.  The residence's sculpted roof is covered with multi-hued tiles and flowering vines, and green shutters frame its windows.  Where the home's front walk divides from the cobbled promenade, a wooden pole stands.",
    "Following the gentle swell of a hill, a cobbled walk skirts a wooded grove that surrounds a charming bungalow.  The residence's sculpted roof is covered with night-flowering vines, and lanterns hanging on either side of its door shed a cheerful light.  Where the home's front walk divides from the cobbled promenade, a wooden pole stands."
