  "description": [
    "Heavy beams of dark timber, likely salvaged from the hulls of wrecked ships, stretch at a steep pitch to the near-darkness that lurks in the open space beneath the thatched roof.  Old fishing nets span the vacancy, artfully strung with branches of dried coral and a variety of shells, and candle-lit lanterns are scattered amongst them, contentiously placed to avoid the threat of fire.  A set of uneven steps lead down into the lobby, and a deep ocean green carpet runner follows in faded increments."
