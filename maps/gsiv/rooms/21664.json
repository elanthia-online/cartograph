    "Several tall, graceful willow trees grow around the airy courtyard, their draping branches hanging low over the fence.  Off to one side, a stack of old books sits next to a large circle of paving stones.  Bright cherry red double doors lead into the two-story gabled building, and set into a thick metal post near the orphanage is a scroll-worked brass plaque.  You also see a series of rope swings hanging from the trees."
