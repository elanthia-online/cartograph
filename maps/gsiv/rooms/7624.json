    "A rough stone pillar rises up out of the surf.  Hundreds of black-shelled mussels cling to its sides, black bumps nestled in the wiry strands that connect them to the rock.  The mussels are splotched with white, droppings from the sea birds who now sleep soundly in their nests.  You notice a patch of rock spotted with connecting fibers, but lacking in mussels.  It looks like someone has been out recently harvesting their dinner.",
