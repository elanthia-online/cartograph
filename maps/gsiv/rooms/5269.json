  "description": [
    "To the north, the hills rise out of the fog that grows denser to the south.  Dense bushes and vines cover the hills, except along this well-trodden path.  A steep climb to the northeast leads through some tall lilac bushes, and a steady incline leads alongside a dry ravine to the northwest."
