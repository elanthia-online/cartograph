    "The air is slightly damp, the silence of the rocky chamber broken by the quiet sound of water dripping far off in the distance.  A tremendous copper drum rises from the floor in the center of the room, tapering to a rounded peak near the ceiling to form a massive still.  Old, iron-banded vats line the walls, forming two rows of oak aisles among the space.  Off to the side, an ebonwood table holds some corked bottles of pale liquid, while a charcoal marble fireplace provides the only light in the space."
