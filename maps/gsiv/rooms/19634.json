    "Small windows along one wall permit a view of the lower decks and the sunlight-drenched waters far below.  Richly hued chestnut marble flooring sparkles as if dusted with gold, and rosewood paneling polished to a luminous glow encloses the room.  However, the focal point is a tile table sparkling with diamonds.  A dealer stands behind the table, and a sign is propped up on it."
