    "Twisting shadows fill the shop's every niche as several dripping candles flicker in the iron sconces that hang on each wall.  Thick velvet draperies cover the windows, blocking out the moonlight and adding to the oppressive feel of the room.  An engraved brass funnel hangs from the ceiling over a large stone bowl that sits adjacent to a nondescript black door.  A shallow copper pan has been placed on the floor near a lined black silk curtain."
