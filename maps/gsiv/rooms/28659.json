  "description": [
    "Blonde oak flooring flows through an open doorway from the parlour, cheerfully reflecting the ambient light in warm, soft tones.  Four full-length windows, looking out onto the patio, flank a set of glass double doors centered in the north wall.  A massive lor dining table, surrounded by elegantly carved lor chairs, rests atop an intricately woven rug in the middle of the room.  A gilt-framed painting hangs above a stone fireplace, the southern wall's only adornment."
