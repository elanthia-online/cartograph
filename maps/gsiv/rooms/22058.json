    "Several leaded-glass windows allow a flood of light into the room, bathing the massive cartographer's worktable in bright light.  Scattered on the table are the tools and products of the mapmaker's trade.  A small, brass-paneled fireplace remains unlit.  An ornate bookcase takes up much of one wall.  The room is brightened by an exotically patterned rug covering the polished parquet floor."
