    "A canyon tumbles down from the mountains to the northeast into the glacial valley.  Perhaps at one time it was carved by the erosive action of flowing water.  Now it is a glacial tributary, a river of ice moving slowly downward toward the huge glacier locked in Gossamer Valley.  The canyon is several hundred feet wide, and the ice provides a fairly flat footing for those wishing to explore the canyon's origins."
