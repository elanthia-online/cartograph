    "A dank, musty odor of mold and ancient stone fills the low tunnel.   Piles of old, fleshless bones, some neatly stacked and some fallen to lie scattered around the cold stone floor, line the walls and fill the dark niches in the rough limestone.  A pyramid of skulls stands undisturbed in the corner beneath the low, sloping ceiling."
