    "Slowly flowing northwest, a small brook babbles melodiously under an arched river-stone bridge.  The polished flagstones bridge the span then give way to blackened cobblestones.  Tall hedges create a living wall to the southeast broken only by three archways carved in silver, gold, and coral.  Engraved in the lintel of each arch is a short phrase and a small sign is planted in the grassy lawn between the paths."
