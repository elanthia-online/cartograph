    "Staggered and broken pillars rise against the sanguine horizon, and between their fractured silhouettes can be glimpsed the movement of tenebrous shadows.  Somewhere between the clouds in the forefront and the sky behind, these long, sinuous tendrils coil and sway, tremendous and grasping as if to pull down the heavens.  Each lash of shadow is chased by an inhuman utterance, not quite a scream, more guttural and resonate, causing the ground to tremble and the air to hum with an unpleasant static."
