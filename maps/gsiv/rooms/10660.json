    "Within the stockade's high log walls, bare soil has been trampled into firm pavement by thousands of booted feet.  In the center of the square courtyard stands a squat wooden blockhouse, apparently constructed with neither windows nor doors.  A steep, shallow stairway cut into the logs runs parallel to the wall, leading to a rampart above."
