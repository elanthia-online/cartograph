    "At the top of a wide staircase, a smartly dressed steward stands to one side of a corridor lined with ivory paper-covered walls and ebonswood wainscoting.  Ornate silver sconces hang on each side of a polished ebonwood door and a white monir door.  A narrow, cushioned bench rests beneath a glass lunette window dominating the far wall."
