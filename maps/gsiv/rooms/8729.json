    "The lane comes to a sorry end at the edge of a nasty-looking beach, ambling between a cluster of mean hovels loitering along the water's edge.  Old cans, broken boxes and the corpses of rats defile the mud tracks in haphazard piles, and the beach appears to grow more polluted the closer it comes to the bay."
