    "The crenelated walls of the tower do very little to keep the arctic winds from tearing through your clothing.  On each of the four corners, a crossed mammoth-tusk flag flutters madly in the breeze.  Off to the east, the stars glitter behind Mount Aenatumgana in the distance, while to the south the lights of Icemule Trace beckon with the promise of warm hearths and hearts.",

To the east the sun gleams off Mount Aenatumgana, while to the north the glacier gleams like an uncut blue-white diamond."
