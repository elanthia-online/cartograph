  "description": [
    "A small barred window near the ceiling illuminates the room with a smattering of light.  The stone walls of the basement are stacked with all manner of wood and metal panels, along with bins holding a fascinating variety of metal bits and hardware.  A middle-aged, bespectacled dwarf glances over the inventory, pushing his felt cap back on his head as he scratches his greying beard and rummages through the papers in his hand."
