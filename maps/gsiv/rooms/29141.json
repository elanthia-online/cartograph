    "Blue, grey, and white flagstones form a checkered pattern upon the western wall, the worked stones smooth and unblemished by dust or cobwebs.  Uniformly grey cobblestones form the floor of the building, while polished warm red mahogany decorates the ceiling.  A single lantern decorates the railing of a pair of ascending stairs, its brightly glowing interior providing a blaze of light that reaches to the sill of a nearby window."
