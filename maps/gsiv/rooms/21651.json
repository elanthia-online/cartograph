    "A sturdy wooden ladder emerges from the rock floor, allowing access back into the keep.  The tall parapet is reinforced here to ensure that access is not blocked by a lucky strike from a besieger's trebuchet, although the thick ramparts below make it unlikely that the precaution will ever be tested.  On the corner of the parapet, a thick pole holds aloft a black flag with a brilliant white shield emblazoned on it."
