    "Supported by a whitewashed ceiling and polished oak panels, the small room is tidy and neat.  A frosted glass globe is suspended from the ceiling by brass fixtures above clusters of mahogany tables.  Chairs set with blue cushions occupy the space around the tables, providing plenty of room for people needing a moment's rest.  Small potted plants occupy each of the room's four corners, while the Vornavis Baronial flag adorns the north wall."
