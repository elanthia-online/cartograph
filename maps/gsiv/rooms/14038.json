    "The burnt remains of some wooden stairs are scattered about the area.  A battered wooden platform that may have anchored stairs leading to the walls ramparts sits at the bottom off the outer walls.  At the base of the platform is a broken weapons rack, seemingly fashioned to hold swords and shields for the defenders on the top of the walls."
