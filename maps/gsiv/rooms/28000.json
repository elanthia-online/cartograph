  "description": [
    "Thick blue felt lines the walls of the spacious, yet small, yurt, while a warm woolen carpet whorled with a pale pink pattern covers the floor.  A thick quilt is draped over the frame of a small yellow pine bed placed against the far wall.  Copper lanterns hang from the slender rafters above, their crystal panes etched with tiny snowberry blossoms."
