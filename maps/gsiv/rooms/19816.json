    "Neatly ordered rows of columns form the circular chamber, banners of black bearing white shields hung between them.  Within the recesses of an arched niche is a towering statue of a man, his grim form knelt down in a vigilant prayer.  A small altar draped with a black velvet cloth is set before the statue, its white surface appearing pale and somber within the embrace of the faint candlelight."
