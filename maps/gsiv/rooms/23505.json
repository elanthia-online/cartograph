  "description": [
    "A layer of thin fresh ice covers the uneven walls and narrow floor in this small hold.  Hoarfrost glistens with a myriad of colorful reflections cast by the flickering flames of an oil lamp that dangles precariously overhead from a rusty length of chain.  The thick chain weaves along the ceiling, anchored in place with large wooden pegs, and supports the frozen carcass of a sizeable sea thrak.  Crooked stairs lead up and out, an icy wooden handrail the only aid in successfully navigating them."
