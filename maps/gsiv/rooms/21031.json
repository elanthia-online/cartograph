  "description": [
    "The river rages to the north of this small semicircular clearing, frothy water occasionally splashing against the muddy bank.  The shore is littered with various pieces of flotsam that have been rendered into unrecognizable lumps of wood.  A thick wall of tall trees stands imposingly to the south, seemingly barring any further passage into the dense jungle, save for two narrow muddy paths.  A blanket of mist and steam rising from the river obscures the tree canopy, giving the world an ethereal appearance."
