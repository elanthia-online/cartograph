    "Settled among the various small tents and stalls scattered around this part of the field is a large glass dome atop a round pedestal flanked by a board-topped wine barrel.  The dome is shaded by a canopy painted a misty, midnight blue, speckled with sparks of white paint.  A placard sits between the pedestal and barrel on a short, three-legged stool."
