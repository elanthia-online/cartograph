  "description": [
    "Towering over the surrounding lawns of manicured grass, an enormous mimosa tree has grown along the edges of the garden.  Spindled limbs, laden with feathery sprigs, bend away from the travertine walls as they stretch towards the star-spangled.  Large table-like boulder dimple the area, their surfaces covered with tablecloths, food, and fitfully burning candles."
