    "The smell of fresh hay permeates the area, the source of which lies in the hayloft at the top of a narrow wooden ladder.  Here on the main floor, several stalls house a variety of farm animals brought in for the night.  Moonlight filters through the window above the double barn doors, illuminating the room with a silvery glow.  Hanging oil lanterns light up a rusted metal shelf along one wall that holds a variety of farm tools.  In the back, a small wooden door leads deeper into the barn.",
    "The smell of fresh hay permeates the area, the source of which lies in the hayloft at the top of a narrow wooden ladder.  Here on the main floor, several stalls lay barren, their occupants put out to pasture.  Sun let in from the window above the double barn doors illuminates a large swath of the hay strewn wooden floorboards, and motes of dust dance delicately in the ray of light.  A rusted metal shelf along one wall holds a variety of farm tools.  In the back, a small wooden door leads deeper into the barn."
