    "Tiny iridescent tea lights paint the alcove in a dreamy pastel glow, the room predominantly cloaked in neutral matte raw silk to highlight the coloration.  At the center of the space, a tufted linen and satin divan sits behind a milky green jade table that is meticulously carved with flourishing wild roses.  Sheer gossamer panels softly frame a sleek marble archway, the egress carefully tucked away in a removed corner."
