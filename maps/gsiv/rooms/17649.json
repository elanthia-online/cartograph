  "description": [
    "The whistling of a cool breeze through the tunnels is joined by the sound of lapping water echoing off nearby ceilings and walls.  The tunnel opens considerably to the north, encompassing a small cove illuminated by torch light.  Crates and barrels line the sides of the tunnel along a well-worn track in a sandy dirt floor.  Small paw prints cover the ground near a corner formed by two crates."
