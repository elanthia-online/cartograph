    "The interior of the wagon is lined with crowded shelves full of glowing mushrooms, casting the area in a dim greenish glow.  Positioned near a blackened iron cauldron, an ebonwood bookshelf creaks under the weight of a multitude of dusty spell tomes.  A glass-panelled armoire displays a variety of crystals and trinkets at the rear of the wagon."
