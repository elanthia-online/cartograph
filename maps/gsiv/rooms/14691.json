    "A gentle breeze drifts through from the garden, carrying with it the sweet, lingering scent of herbs mingled with the distinctive perfume of roses.  Deep green tendrils of Imaera's Lace cling to the weathered boards of this small shack, occasionally loosening a cascade of delicate white florets onto the battered counter set up near the middle of the room.  An ancient gnome clad in stained work clothes shuffles among the pots and baskets, fussing over a selection of cuttings and whistling a merry tune."
