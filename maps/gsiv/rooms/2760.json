    "The arctic terrain languishes in the grip of the cruel storms ranging across the bleak landscape like distant galleons on a frozen sea.  Ridges of ice fringe the caps of undulating waves of snowdrifts.  In the northern distance, an immense mountain fills the horizon, its feet obscured by storms."
