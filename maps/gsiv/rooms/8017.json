    "This is the actual workface of the mine.  Gravel-sized chunks of raw ore litter the ground and there are piles of rock and stone waiting to be carried away for processing.  The rock ceiling is low and cramped and the air is cold and stale.  Poorly placed and rotting timbers that sag do little for your feelings of security.  Rust-stained ruts in the ground show where rails may have once lain, long since pried up for other uses it seems."
