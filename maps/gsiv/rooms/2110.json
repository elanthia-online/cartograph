  "description": [
    "Though much of the house is still in good repair, this room has been nearly demolished.  Pale grey cushions have been pulled from the furniture and ripped to shreds.  Mahogany tables are now little more than kindling, smashed almost beyond recognition.  Paintings have been pulled from the walls, and ribbons of canvas litter the floor.  In some places, even the heavy paneling has been pried away to reveal the plaster beneath."
