  "description": [
    "Tiny blue cobalt cages line the walls of the sanctum, their crystal-studded bars infused with a pale violet light.  Prismatic reflections from the jewels cut through the lingering shadows of the chamber to reveal a circular dome overhead.  Underfoot, a tattered carpet softens the granite tiles of the floor, held in place by a polished stone rack and a shallow stone bowl."
