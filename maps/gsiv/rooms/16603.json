    "Blue-speckled sea glass walls rise from a swirled sea glass floor.  Just above a tropical floral arrangement hangs a noble elf maiden portrait, and an etched seaglass ceiling completes the picture.  A wide faenor-trimmed table and a floral-etched ceramic case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
