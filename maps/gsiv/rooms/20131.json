    "A mass of woven ropes, akin to a loose net, forms a protective tunnel around the heavy bough.  Openings in the mesh provide porthole views beyond the edge of the tree and down the western slope of the hill it sits upon.  A bit of graffito scratched is scratched into the banyan's bark, within easy reading distance of a natural arch leading into the interior of the tree itself."
