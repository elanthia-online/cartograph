  "description": [
    "Swaths of jewel-tone silks cover the rough plank walls of this small cabin, contrasting vibrantly against the dull wood.  A scrollwork table rests against the far wall, displaying carefully folded garments.  In one corner rests a carved armoire, the surface painted in a distressed teal hue.  A painted hatch leads back out."
