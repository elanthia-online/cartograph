    "The north end of the spacious lobby is flanked by the front desk on one side and a wide spiral staircase on the other.  Between them, a lunar mobile spins slowly against a sky of black spidersilk stitched with gleaming white starstones.  A tall, dignified elf stands behind the front desk, ready to attend to your every need."
