    "To the north of the path a modest stage has been constructed, not far from the rose gardens that lie just to the east.  A gentle hill rises to the south of the path, affording natural tiered seating to those wishing to watch a performance being enacted on the stage.  Diminutive lights have been set into the base of the stage, allowing for nighttime performances."
