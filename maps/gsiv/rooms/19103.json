    "Water barrels, wine barrels, bales of cotton -- all sorts of cargo make up the walls of the aisle.  From supporting timbers spaced at regular intervals, lanterns sway gently in response to the calm waters of the harbor.  A cabin is nestled among the stacks, with a carved maoral door to give access."
