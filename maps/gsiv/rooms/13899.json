    "The trail rounds an extensive growth of ferns.  Their vivid green fronds arch in all directions, like an army on the march with scimitars raised.  Overhead, the limbs of birch mix with those of dense pawpaw trees, creating slanting beams of light which shine through the shade in distinct rays and highlight the delicacy of the ferns' leaves.  Although hidden by foliage, the sound of the waterfall can be heard close at hand."
