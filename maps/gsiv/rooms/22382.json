    "Rising high above, the peaked ceiling is patterned with white-tinged crystalline skylights and swathes of lush silk in warm earth tones.  Silvery blue marble walls flawlessly transition to teak floors that are raised platform style above a cultivated ground of soft mosses and smooth stones.  Melodically tumbling across painted river stones, a gentle brook lends its voice to the delicate sound of bird call that fills the air."
