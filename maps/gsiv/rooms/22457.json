    "Sewn into the eastern wall of the tent is a large family crest that has been shrouded by a large black band.  Along the western wall a wooden stage has been erected, with a small notice hung next to it.  A group of mannequins have been posed to the side of the stage area, creating an attentive audience.  The faint scent of phlox wafts in through a small opening in the tent.",
