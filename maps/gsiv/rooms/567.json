    "The trail makes a pronounced dog-leg around the bole of a mammoth-sized oak.  The tree's base could accommodate a small hamlet were it hollowed out, and huge clumps of rhododendron bushes growing at its foot look tiny in comparison to the tree's behemoth proportions.  Ferns grow out of the deep crevices in the oak's bark, garlanding its sides with their emerald color."
