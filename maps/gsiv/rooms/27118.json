  "description": [
    "Thickets of shrubs, ancient trees, and clinging liana vines accentuate the untamed wilderness.  Large, gnarled roots descend into the rich, leaf-covered soil from each of the tree trunks, their lengths protruding here and there as they tangle over each other in a fierce struggle for space amongst the overgrowth of plant-life.  Small depressions in the remains of long-dead tree limbs collect rainwater for the multitude of insects drawn to the humid environment."
