  "description": [
    "Just off the kitchen, the bedroom is quaint and remains cooled by the tropical breeze drifting through an open window.  A tiny bed is pushed against a wall, and a carved wooden nightstand rests next to it.  A maoral-framed painting hangs crookedly above an untidy writing desk."
