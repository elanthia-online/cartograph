    "Splotches of dark-colored liquid slowly stream out from beneath both a tall tree-topped platform and a tall wooden palisade, converging into a profusion of mud that takes up residence here.  Couched in darkness, only the faint light of spectral-like threads floating in the air in the distance, and the occasional specter passing by on the other side of the palisade, provides a hint of illumination.",
