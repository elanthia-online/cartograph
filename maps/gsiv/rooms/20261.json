    "Golden mistwood poles provide support for overlapping swathes of blue and silver silk that create the ceiling and walls of this large pavilion.  Embroidered throw rugs cover the ground, with a few stray blades of grass poking through here and there where the coverings meet.  Gold lanterns pierced with sunburst patterns host tiny cobalt beeswax candles, casting flickering light over a spindly silver table."
