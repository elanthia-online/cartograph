  "description": [
    "Thick, deep-green velvet drapes cover most of the walls of this enormous room, helping to insulate against noise.  At the head of the room, a podium has been set up surrounded on three sides by rows of wooden benches covered with green velvet cushions.  Behind the podium, a bronze statue of a large winged drake looms ominously."
