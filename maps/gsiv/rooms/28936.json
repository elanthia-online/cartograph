  "description": [
    "Leached of color, the driftwood walls curve to form a peaked roof that converge upon a single, thick oak beam.  Brass lanterns, shielded by rainbow glaes windows, hang from hooks over a leather-topped dark oak counter, their steady glow illuminating both the counter's surface and a nearby mahogany sign.  A low cloth-covered bench pressed against one wall looks to have served as someone's bed in recent history, and discarded clothing strewn about the space bespeaks a history of residence in this small room."
