  "description": [
    "A dozen white granite planters line a low greystone wall that runs along each side of the var.  Each home or shop owner in this neighborhood competes with the neighbors to cultivate a more exotic selection of orchids.  A gentle fragrance rises from the floral display, mingling with the heterogeneous odor of the city.",
    "The residential stretch of the var is lined with stately homes, each presenting a different variation on classical Illistimi architecture -- columns, friezes, and white marble are in abundance.  An argent planter sits next to one doorstep, a single tiny orchid cradled within it."
