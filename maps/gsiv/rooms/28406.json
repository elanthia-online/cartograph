    "Moonlight falling in through the high-set stained glass window casts an array of silvered jewel-toned colors across the bare floor.  In mimicry of the display, each candle on the iron sconces dotting the walls is encased by a bejeweled shade, and the flickering flames set the gemstones alight in a rainbow of color.  At the center of the room rests a tiered rowan table, its lower surface draped in heavy velvet, while the upper are left bare.  Beneath the table sits a small silver chest.",
