    "Tall mahogany bookshelves cover each wall in the library, leaving only space for the mahogany archway.  Resting in the center of the room is a green felt-covered table, which is surrounded by a number of cushioned chairs.  Hanging from the ceiling is a chandelier with bejeweled dice strung from the branched arms.  Overlooking the deck, a gold-framed glass porthole allows for sunlight to trickle into the library, which rests just above a vivid lapis lazuli globe."
