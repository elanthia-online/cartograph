  "description": [
    "Built into the remaining three walls of a ruined building is an open kitchen.  A huge, sailcloth sheet has been lashed to the crumbling sides, replacing the long gone roof.  Fruitwood cupboards faced with glass panes line the walls on either side of a sandstone archway, while an enormous, stone cooking wall has been built into the southern wall of the ruins.  A wide driftwood counter sits upon huge sandstone blocks in the center of the room."
