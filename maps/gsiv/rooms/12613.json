    "You are standing before the Altar of Sacrifice.  It has been fashioned of green-veined black marble, and a pair of manacles are fastened to each end.  The surface of the altar is quite glossy, yet the floor is sticky with dark red stains.  Feeling a bit nervous, you wonder if you should leave before someone mistakes you for the next sacrifice."
