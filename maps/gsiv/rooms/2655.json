    "The tip of the drake's tail concludes in a barbed horn that is poised directly over the rippling surface of the spring-warmed pool.  A temperate column of air rising from the water envelops the scaled extremity and leaves the stone free of ice, but slippery nonetheless from the constant moisture."
