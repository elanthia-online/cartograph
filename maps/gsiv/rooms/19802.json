    "Numerous stone shelves line the walls here, spanning from floor to ceiling and completely stocked with alchemic ingredients.  A few patches of silvery moss have sprung up in the corners of the room, bathed in the light of a giant luminescent toadstool.  Beyond a simple granite archway is a short tunnel, lined with crystal growths."
