  "description": [
    "The deck slants to starboard.  The mizzenmast has been broken a few yards above the deck.  Although the mizzen masthead dangles dangerously above it is held aloft by the remains of the standing rigging, the shrouds and stays taut as bowstrings.  The wind blows through the ship's bell, an oddly-shaped bit of brass tubing, creating an eerie, sepulchral moan.  Steps lead down to the quarterdeck."
