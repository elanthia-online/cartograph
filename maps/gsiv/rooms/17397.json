    "Lanterns hang from rope-suspended hooks, lighting the room.  A pair of sturdy-looking dwarves lean casually against the wall, appearing to simply be relaxing for a moment.  Their keen, alert gazes belie this, however.  A couple of stocky chairs sit around a makeshift table made from a crate, two mugs and various playing cards littering its surface."
