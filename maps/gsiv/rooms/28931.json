  "description": [
    "Hanging from wrought iron wall anchors, pot-bellied glass and blued steel lanterns maintain a comfortable brightness throughout the tidy office during all times of the day and night.  Various papers, signs, notes, and maps are tacked to a large bulletin board that is hung over a simple wooden desk and its matching chair.  A cast iron stove, its chimney piped out of the southern wall, occupies one corner of the space, while a rough oak ladder leads to the second floor."
