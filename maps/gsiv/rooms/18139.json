    "Built in tiers, the council chamber rises in three stages -- stone, glass, and tile.  Its lowest register has a silvery stone floor and wall that is set with a pair of doors.  Above that, a ring of windows stack one atop another, paned in alternating clear and blue glass.  At the dome, a mosaic covers the ceiling, depicting the formal crest of House Illistim.  A round table and upholstered seats take up the majority of the floor, though ample space is present in a ring around the furniture."
