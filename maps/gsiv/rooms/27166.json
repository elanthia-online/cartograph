  "description": [
    "Ringed by bookcases, the cramped storage room is cluttered with supplies for making draughts, potions, elixirs, and all manner of remedies.  Dried herbs dangle from the exposed rafters of the ceiling, while the floor is crowded with crates and boxes.  Various tools are housed upon the only free wall, which is bisected by a narrow oak door that leads to the front room.  An errant breeze from behind the furniture, perhaps from a unseen window, carries with it a hint of brimstone."
