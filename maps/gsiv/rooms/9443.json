    "Multi-tiered austere iron shelving abut each other along the perimeter of the chamber, while reinforced steel racks and stacked boxes occupy its center.  The vast storage capacity is put to use, housing the repository's bountiful inventory.  Despite the great volume, the items are systematically catalogued with military organization."
