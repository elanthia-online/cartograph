    "Thin beams of bronze-leafed oak frame panels of etched glass, the half-circle ceiling curving down to meet circular windows set into the outer wooden walls.  A chiseled grey marble fountain dominates the center of a stone-pebbled pathway, carved into the form of a lithe elven maiden, her water-filled palms upraised to reveal blush pink water lilies.  Swathes of metallic chiffon frame the northern entrance, creating a hazy curtain between the two areas."
