    "A meticulously manicured lawn embraces the front of the temple.  The landscaping consists of cleanly clipped hedges and neat circular beds of crimson and white daisies placed symetrically on each side of the marble path.  Everything has sharp, concise lines and an almost military look about it, including the heavy oak doors leading into the temple."
