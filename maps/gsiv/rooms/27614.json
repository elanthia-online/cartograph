    "Built into the southeast side of a hill, a massive earthworks structure looks out over the expanse of darkness.  A rounded scarlet maoral door lit by a small copper lamp in the center of the facade provides entrance to the building.  Cascades of icicles are illuminated by a small copper sconce above a mahogany cedar door set into the face of a hill nearby.  Past a pearlescent granite full moon, a well-cleared path curves up and around the hill.",
    "Built into the western face of an icy hill, a glaes-faced earthworks structure with a rounded scarlet maoral door looks over the expansive plains.  A cascade of icicles forms a canopy above a mahogany cedar door set into the face of the hill near a gnarly mesille tree.  Curving back to the knoll above, an icy path serves as a questionable egress.  A pearlescent granite full moon is set upon the ground at a respectful distance from the glaes-faced cavern."
