  "description": [
    "Howling winds scatter sea spray in all directions from waves that crash violently into this ruined jetty.  Massive granite blocks that form the walkway here have been wrenched into dangerous angles, making the footing treacherous -- one wrong move meaning broken bones or a plunge into churning waters.  Waves deposit detritus of driftwood branches, bundles of seaweed, and ground shale in the narrow crevices between the upturned granite blocks before draining back into the turbulent ocean."
