    "Cobblestones in drab grey and tan form a swirl in the middle of the pathway, spiraling in towards a thin obsidian pedestal.  A cloudy crystal ball, polished into a perfect sphere, balances atop the pedestal.  Two yew trees, their bark grey and their branches pendulous with old needles, stoop like old men towards the ball."
