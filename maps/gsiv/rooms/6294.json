    "A vertical shaft serves as a transom of sorts, bringing down a square of moonlight into the center of the chamber.  A couple of rotting scrolls and broken tablets are gathered together in the dim light.  A fresh but crumpled parchment beside the others is covered with fine scribbles and a stylus lies nearby, as if some scholar had been studying and taking notes.",
