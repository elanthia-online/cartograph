    "A sea of mottled grey wheat stretches out to the northwest, west, and southwest, its surface only a few feet high.  The stalks, heavy with their nearly ripened kernels, wave slowly back and forth in the warm, gentle wind.  The ground underfoot is soft, springy and just a little moist.  To the southeast, the farmland road runs between fields, while in the northwest distance a line of birch trees blocks the horizon.",
