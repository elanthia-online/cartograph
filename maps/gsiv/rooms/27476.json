    "The large space is broken by a curtain that separates the front area from the rest of the tent.  Gold thread swirls through the forest green canvas, creating a marbling effect that catches the light from the torches stuck in the dirt floor at the corners of the space.  In the center of the area, a circular wooden display holds three sections of wares for sale.  A gap in the curtain leads deeper into the tent."
