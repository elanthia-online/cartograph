    "Slender knotty oak planks are alternated with ebonwood to create a striped pattern that slants diagonally across the walls of the small room.  Plush wine-hued rugs braided with silver accents create a soft cushion on the floor and support a small table and chair set that is arranged before a pair of glass-front doors.  To the immediate left of a paneled ebonwood door rests an ornately carved sleigh bed draped in moonlight hues and wrought iron candelabrum."
