    "Thick blades of blue-green grass rise around the crushed cinnamon bark path, their dark expanses creating shadows that stretch across the nearby trees.  Stretching their gnarled boughs towards the heavens, the nearby trees create a viridian canopy that is darkened by cord-like vines and colorful tropical blooms.  A clearing can be glimpsed beyond the trees clustered around the eastern edge of the path."
