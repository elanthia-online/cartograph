  "description": [
    "Unlike the other roads of East Row, this one does not end in a profusion of foliage or plantlife.  Spinewood Way ends at the town's fortification walls, which are composed of log and post construction.  No attempt is made to beautify the area, save for the neatly trimmed lawns near each shop."
