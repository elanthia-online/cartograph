    "Water chuckles boisterously as it falls into the stream, cascading over an outcropping some twenty feet above and splashing off of the rock wall.  Scattered about the forest floor, modwir and pine cones rest amongst fallen needles.  To the northwest, the stream flows down into a sparse, rocky pasture."
