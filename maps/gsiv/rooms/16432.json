    "Polished alabaster rises from the winding stairs at this corner of the corridor and mimics the frothy flow of waves cresting upon the plum carpet.  Decorative mother-of-pearl balusters are evenly spaced to match the wave-shaped steps as they descend to the landing below, while near at hand they culminate in a pair of banisters fashioned into the semblance of paired mermaids holding urns above their heads."
