    "The sheer size of this pavilion is staggering, its peaked canopy held aloft by a structured series of wooden support beams and poles.  Strings of multi-hued paper lanterns are draped overhead, the soft light filtering through the shades taking on a variety of jewel-toned hues.  From the apex of the center peak of the pavilion hangs a spoked directional guide, with each wrought iron arrow supporting a small sign."
