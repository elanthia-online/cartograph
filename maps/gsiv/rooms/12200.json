  "description": [
    "A circular marble pillar sits in the middle of a room with thick grey tapestries for walls.  Above this pillar floats a large skull that appears to be serpentine or lizardlike in nature, slowly rotating in a sphere of blue energy.  The skull rotates, morphing into an elven one, then gently spinning again and changing into a human one, then a krolvin skull, then a giant one, and finally back to the serpent one."
