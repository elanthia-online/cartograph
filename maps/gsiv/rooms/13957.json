  "description": [
    "Wandering closer to the Mistydeep River, the path is marked off by neat rows of rocks bordering raked gravel.  A few willows and other water-loving trees dot the bank.  Clumps of wildflowers and grasses grow freely, progressing from low sedges nearest the river to honeysuckle and other shrubs on the rising land to the west."
