  "description": [
    "Warmed by a roaring hearth framed by a vast fireplace of rough-hewn marble, the greatroom has a high ceiling supported by beams of white pine.  A curving couch of rich mountain rolton leather is positioned to take full advantage of the fireglow.  Behind it, a polished white marble buffet table is laden with enough hors d'ouevres to feed a halfling village.  Huge floor-to-ceiling windows let firelight escape into the cold dark beyond the greatroom's confines, their edges traced with creeping rime."
