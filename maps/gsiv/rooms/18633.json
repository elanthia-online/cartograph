    "Frescoes of mermaids have been lovingly painted onto the walls and ceiling of this sea green room.  Each holds in her hand a different symbol dangling from a pearl-studded chain, representing each of the gods that belong in the Pantheon of Others.  Several lounges sit in strategic places about the room, inviting rest and relaxation, as well as worship."
