    "Against the curved wall sits a marble altar, its contours echoing the arcuation.  Light from the dome above plays across its polished surface, dappling it as clouds drift past the moons outside.  A formidable sword rests upon the altar, and although the altar's dimensions seem perfectly contrived to bear the weapon's span, the sword lies there askew, as if casually discarded."
