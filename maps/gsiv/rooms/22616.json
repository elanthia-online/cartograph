  "description": [
    "An indistinct humming noise fills the air in this rear portion of the hovel, and the air is heavy with heat and humidity.  Strings of old, rusty fish hooks hang from one wall, while another is plastered with carnival posters, which are quite obviously covering what was once a large hole.  Atop a damaged crab cage in the corner is a small misshapen pot, and opposite is a slanted cot covered in molding blankets and pillows."
