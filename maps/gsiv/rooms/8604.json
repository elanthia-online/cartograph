    "Water seeps in from somewhere high on one wall and trickles down to fall into a small depression in the rock floor.  One look at the blackened, smelly water is enough of a deterrent to trying to slake one's thirst.  There is barely enough light to make out a cleft in the back wall and the shadowy cave mouth that leads back outside."
