    "Flickering golden yellow light from dozens of bronze sconces that hang high up on the walls illuminates this chamber.  On the far right wall hangs a lovely brocade tapestry which depicts scenes from the town's early days.  A threadbare rug covers the entire floor, muffling the steps of the townsfolk.  A perky young elven clerk sits patiently waiting to assist someone."
