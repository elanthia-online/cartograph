    "[A Violet Silk Tent]"

  "description": [
    "Shed from strings of translucent white paper lanterns dangling from the tent's supports, pale white light bathes the area, giving everything it touches a faint silvery sheen.  Swathes of royal purple satin hang scalloped along each of the violet walls, pinned at their apex by clusters of dark and glossy greenery.  Along one side of the space is a tiered glass display, while across the way sits a velvet-topped jewelry table, and a carpeted runner spans the width between."
