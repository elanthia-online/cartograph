  "description": [
    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  A twisted sandstone sculpture sits in one corner of an unfinished wooden floor.  There is some carved haon pegs on one side of the shop and a salt-crusted sandstone case on the other."
