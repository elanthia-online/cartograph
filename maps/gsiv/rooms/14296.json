    "Flood lines mark the broken walls of the remaining buildings and attest to the competence of those who chose to build here.  Although a beautiful area, likely once envied by other neighborhoods, the subjacent nature of the ground to the surrounding water makes it unsuitable to inhabit for long.  The boardwalk stretches to the south and west.  A tiny kitten, carrying a captured rodent, struts across the promenade."
