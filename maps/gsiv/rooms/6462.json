    "Just off to one side of the trail, a common spider has constructed a huge web between two trees.  It is difficult to make out in the moonlight, but you can see that it stretches up at least six feet off the ground and some four or five feet from side to side.  An overgrown trail winds its way around the web, as if in deference to the integrity of the spider's creation.",
