  "description": [
    "The village commons is a grassy swath cut into the terraced strip of land east of the village proper.  The green is set down into the rich earth just enough to keep a lethargic rolton from scrambling out on a hot day.  An unwholesome mist pools in the sunken grassy area, and the moist earth gives way to a quagmire at one end."
