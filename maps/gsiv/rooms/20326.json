    "The cabin sits at a crazy, tilted angle, turning walls into floor and ceiling and ceiling and floor into walls.  Upended shipping containers protrude from the sludge of mud and wet filth that has seeped into the chamber, the continued suck and draw of which threatens to eventually consume the vessel entirely.  A single hatch in the metal cladding of the crashed airship is the only viable entrance or egress, though even that is partially askew."
