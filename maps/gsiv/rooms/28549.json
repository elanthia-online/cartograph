  "description": [
    "The sky above is broken and stained a menacing crimson hue, with lightning spearing across at intervals to illuminate the massive, bruised clouds against the ruddy backdrop.  Nothing of the incongruous heavens is solid or sure, though the ground is stable enough, black sands scattered deep over hard-packed earth.  A portal stands at the rear of the arena, corkscrewing within a frame set directly into the wall, its viridian mists chased by violet arcs of energy that charge the air with the scent of ozone."
