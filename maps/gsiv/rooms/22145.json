    "Beautiful linden molding adorns the white silk walls that stretch down the hallway.  Doors crafted in a variety of styles mark the private rooms of the manor's members.  Growing from a ceramic urn, a potted rosebush climbs up the wall, supported on a wire trellis.  Its deep crimson and verdant colors are a sharp contrast to the lighter hues in the area."
