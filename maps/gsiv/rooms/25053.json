    "Overlapping layers of charred foliage lead up to a gypsy camp, the path highlighted by strings of half-melted candles hanging from skeletal black willow trees lining the entrance.  Shields of various shapes lean against the trunks of the willows, painted with dirt-covered sanguine symbols, several of which have been gouged and left incomprehensible.  The distinct sounds of crunching echo down the clay-packed pathway."
