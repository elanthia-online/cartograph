    "The low-set ceiling and the clusters of softly-glowing beeswax candles impart an intimate ambiance to this small chamber.  A thin, stylized carving of a faceless figure reaches out from the eastern wall, its arms spread as if in a gesture of welcoming.  A simple, unadorned white ora altar stands beneath the statue, an open book lying upon it.  The granite that forms the walls and ceiling is nearly pure white, its flat surface awash with rippling, warm amber waves from the candlelight."
