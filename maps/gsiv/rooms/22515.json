    "Thin lattices of bronze piping support walls of rich, absinthe silk velvet, the patina-streaked metal blending into the vibrant tones of green.  Nestled upon a feather-strewn yellowed glass case is a large leather-hinged hatbox, its contents scattered haphazardly amongst the coppery plumage.  Along the back wall, a curtain of gear-strung chains provides entrance to another room."
