  "description": [
    "Four slender columns stretch up from the marble floor of the round chamber, supporting a high domed ceiling.  Tall arched windows along the east curve overlook the courtyard below and illuminate the narthex with great bars of sunlight.  A line of tapestries decorates the west and southern curves, ending at a wide arch to the southeast.  Colorful cushions and long divans are scattered about the room, some occupied by solitary musicians and small groups engaged in animated discussion."
