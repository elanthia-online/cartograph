    "Heavy blue watered silk tapestries embroidered with a scattering of silver-threaded crescent moons and stars decorate the walls and block the windows.  Rectangular displays enclosed with glass holds a variety of edged weapons.  Along the back wall, an assortment of throwing weapons dangle from an old throwing net.  Several handblown glass lanterns are deliberately positioned on tall metal poles designed to provide sufficient lighting for viewing the various exhibits."
