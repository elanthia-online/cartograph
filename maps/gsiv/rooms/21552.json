    "A thick steel wire has been strung up between two of the tent posts, upon which hang a number of instruments.  Beneath the orderly display is a simple glass case illuminated by lit green and yellow votive candles.  A scratched wooden wardrobe doubles as a bookcase housing a number of music-related tomes and texts.  Nearby, a polished steel stand has been partially draped by a patchwork quilt, though most of its contents are visible from other areas of the tent."
