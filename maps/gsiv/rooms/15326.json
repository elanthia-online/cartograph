    "A ruby-eyed grinning skull hangs on one of the smooth granite walls, and a mistwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A scaled model of Hearthstone sits in one corner of a glossy mahogany floor.  There is a vine-carved mahogany table on one side of the shop and a gilded maple cabinet on the other."
