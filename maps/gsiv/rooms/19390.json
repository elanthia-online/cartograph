  "description": [
    "Thick and cloying, the air in this section of the warehouse is heavy with the acrid scent of chemicals despite the wide open window located in its eastern wall.  Curing frames hang from the exposed rafters above vats filled with viscous liquids, while a long counter stretching across the opposite wall provides ample workspace for the various apprentices that move through the room completing obscure tasks."
