    "The pines open into a clearing produced by a large outcrop of boulders in its center.  A number of rhododendron bushes grow in a clump against the rock, their oval leaves curled into thin fingers with the cold.  The trail disappears at the foot of an incline, where more of the granite breaks through the loam and displays a face banded with minerals."
