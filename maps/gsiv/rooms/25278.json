  "description": [
    "The scent of vanilla fills this softly lit room.  To the side a picture window stands open, its lace curtains swaying as a fragrant breeze swirls in from the garden below.  A music stand sits in one corner, an unfinished composition lying in its folds.  Beneath the window lies a large bed, several instruments laying haphazardly against its side."
