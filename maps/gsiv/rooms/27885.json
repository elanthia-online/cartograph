    "Ribbed black willow walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above a pile of striped throw pillows hangs a ruby-eyed grinning skull, and an ebonwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  An oval-shaped speckled marble counter and a jewel-inlaid caddy stand side by side in the middle of the room."
