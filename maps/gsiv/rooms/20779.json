  "description": [
    "Stone grey walls surround this small room that is little more than a spacious closet.  Leaning up against one wall, a small table stands beside a curved crimson doorway that leads out of the room.  Nearby, a young attendant stands ready to serve.  The focal point of the room is a swirling black and red portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Clusters of stars have been etched into the metal, several of them spouting tails like comets."
