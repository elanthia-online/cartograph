  "description": [
    "This space is perfectly round, with a gently sloping ceiling that rises to a small opening at its peak.  Through this opening, the light outside comes through and strikes a deeply-flawed crystal mounted in the floor.  The floor underneath is firmly packed dirt, and the walls are sheer stone, but the room is curiously bereft of the echoes one would expect from such a space."
