  "description": [
    "Beds of aquatic grasses contribute to the lush surroundings of these saltwater shallows.  Creatures adapted to the watery habitat pursue the natural order of their lives, resulting in an environment not without hazards for land-based interlopers, even at water's ebb line.  A steep drop-off in terrain marks a descent into the depths of a separate freshwater river.  Crossing this second watercourse is only possible via a climb up some snarled banyan roots to access higher ground on the opposite shore."
