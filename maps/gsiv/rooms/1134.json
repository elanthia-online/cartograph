    "The trail attempts to follow the river as best it can, winding among the trees that grow close to the shore and avoiding the protruding boulders.  The ground squishes heavily underfoot in many areas where the trail comes very near to the river's slow-moving waters.  The temperate air causes a bit of humidity to rise from the moist soil, but a breeze that follows the river channel helps to keep it from becoming an oppressive wet heat."
