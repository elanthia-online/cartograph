    "The room is suffused with a warm amber glow from the multitude of candles arranged in the recesses cut into the stone walls.  Sheer saffron-colored drapes surround the large four-poster bed.  The scent from a vase filled with jasmine and ferns gently perfumes the air.  A thick, ivory colored wool carpet covers the floor."
