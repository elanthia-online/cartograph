    "Only two rotting, wooden walls remain standing of what was once a small home.  Painted all over the walls, both inside and out, are strange pictures, symbols and gibberish words.  Broken pottery and bits of furniture peek out from under the rotting leaves and decaying debris on the dirt floor."
