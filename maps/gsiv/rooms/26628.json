    "[Steep Insights, West Alcove]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A slight alcove on the west side of the cottage holds a large rusted tin chest filled with colorful tea containers, a small square oak box holding several infusers, and a round woven reed basket of flavorings designed to enhance your beverages.  The repaired roof overhead is not perfectly done, with evident gaps between the boards stuffed with dried sphagnum moss.  The scent of earth almost overwhelms the other delicate fragrances here."
