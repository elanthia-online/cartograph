    "The street splits around a colorful gazebo, then meets again on the other side.  The structure is carved from several kinds of decorative woods, all sealed against the weather, and carved by skilled artisans.  All kinds of fantastic animal reliefs run playfully around the stand, so detailed that the wooden representations appear almost real."
