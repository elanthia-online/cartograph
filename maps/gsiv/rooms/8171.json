    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the smooth sandstone walls, and a paneled haon ceiling rises overhead.  A fragrant pink jasmine plant sits in one corner of a patterned hardwood floor.  There is a long mahogany rack on one side of the shop and a heavy lead glass display case on the other."
