    "Carmine dahlias sway lightly in the breeze, trailing down a gentle slope that smoothly levels off into a rustic, warm-toned garden.  Plump purple heirloom tomatoes hang heavy on deep green vines that wind their way up burnished bronze trellises staked in the supple earth.  Planted at the base of the stems, rows of marigold florets bud in solar shades of creamy yellow, vibrant orange, and rich burgundy."
