  "description": [
    "The ledge ends in a huge rock outcropping that forms a solid face of stone, etched with striations of red and brown.  A few small homes are set back against the canyon wall, taking advantage of what little shade is offered.  A huge lizard suns himself atop the outcropping, slowly flicking his long tail."
