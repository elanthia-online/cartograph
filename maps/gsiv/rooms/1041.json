    "The gloom produced by the thick mist is dark enough that fireflies have come out to play.  The small winged insects flit about, flashing in shades of red and yellow as they move among the tall grasses in search of mates or food.  The absence of a breeze makes it easy for the insects to maneuver, and occasionally a large cloud of them will spill across the path directly ahead as if daring anything to move through them.  Somehow they always seem to get out of the way before a confrontation occurs, though."
