  "description": [
    "This room is larger than the rest of the guestrooms.  Several chairs and a small sofa provide a cozy sitting area, and a large bed leans against the wall behind them.  Rich purples and violets give the room a slightly regal touch, as if this room were perhaps meant for finer travellers passing through on their way to important business."
