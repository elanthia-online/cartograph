    "Two plush sofas and several chairs are strewn across a shredded scarlet rug, their legs broken and the fabric coverings ripped.  Several fierce beasts that must be from the surrounding wilderness have been mounted on the wall as trophies, but one of them, a fearsome mottled rock lizard, has been mutilated and lies ruined on the floor."
