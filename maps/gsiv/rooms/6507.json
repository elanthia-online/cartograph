    "[Old Noralgar Road]"

  "description": [
    "The old road is more evident here, although its double tracks are overgrown with tufts of grass and wildflowers.  Overhead, conifers make a patchy canopy that allows the ground cover to spread.  A stream cuts across the way, its banks defined by stones and large boulders which are carpeted green with moss.  The stream appears to be shallow, and on its opposite bank, the road climbs out of the water and continues on.  To the southwest, a trail, little more than a game path, winds into deeper forest."
