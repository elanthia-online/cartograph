  "description": [
    "Archers stand watch atop this stony battlement.  To the north, the ever-restless sea pounds endlessly against the rocky shoreline.  To the west, the wharves of the Locksmehr River are overshadowed by the grim countenance of Darkstone Castle.  To the south, tilled fields and woodlands become forested foothills and snow-capped mountains.  To the east looms Thanotoph's menacing, twin peaks and the fiery slopes of a nameless volcano."
