    "Two circular windows provide an ample view of the dark wharf outside, with a handful of dockworkers laboring late into the evening.   Moonlight from the open doorway casts a sliver of silver light across the shop's floor, while dim lanterns supply a sufficient brightness to the area.  A scruffy half-krolvin shopkeeper leans upon a driftwood counter and seems to doze off more than once.  The weak scent of sea salt lingers in the shop.",
    "Two circular windows provide an ample view of the wharf outside, with dockworkers loading and unloading a handful of ships in port.  Sunlight from the open doorway brightens the shop, light glinting off of an assortment of equipment lining a wide corner shelf.  A scruffy half-krolvin shopkeeper stands behind a driftwood counter, conversing with some customers browsing about.  The weak scent of sea salt lingers in the shop."
