    "As the trail winds north into thick stands of pine, outcrops of rock become less frequent.  Underfoot, a dense carpet of needles alternates with the covering of snow, peeking out from under the blanket of white in rich browns and reds.  Lichen grows on the rough bark of the trees, adding gold and bronze to the color medley of the pine mulch."
