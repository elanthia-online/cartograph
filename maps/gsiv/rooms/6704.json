    "The remains of an old guard post are here.  From the positioning of a small rock barrier, it seems that this post was made to prevent anyone from entering the caves in this direction.  A small rut has been worn behind the barrier, apparently from the repeated pacing of sentries at this point.  To the west the cave seems to open into a much larger cavern.  Dim light can be seen coming from the northeast."
