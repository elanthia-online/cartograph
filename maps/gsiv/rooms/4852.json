    "The stream crosses the path to the northwest, a natural rock bridge providing a way to the opposite bank.  To the southeast, the path continues to follow the stream, birch trees lining the eastern bank.  An eddy in the stream creates an illusion of the water flowing upstream.  Just below the water's surface, several trout are visible, fighting the current."
