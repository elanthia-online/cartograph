    "Standing before the pass, a majestic-looking weeping willow prevents further traveling into the woods.  The tree's trunk is barely visible through its thick, elongated leaves, however, the surface of the bark is quite dark.  Several orange and purple flowers sprout throughout the willow's foliage.  An opening at the base of the trunk leads under the tree and appears is wide enough for travel."
