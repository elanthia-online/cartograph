    "A small pond rests in the center of the field, fed by a gently trickling stream to the east.  Several brightly colored fish, ranging in hue from golden browns to pale white to vibrant reds, yellows, and golds, swim about in circles near the pond's bank.  Small white flowers rest atop lily pads that float on the water's surface, and the occasional croak of a bullfrog breaks the silence in the air."
