    "Suspended from heavy ironwood beams that are reinforced with wrought iron, a slender catwalk stretches across a frosted glass ceiling that is beaded with sweat.  Cobalt and mist grey panes form an elegant stained glass window above, their interwoven designs creating a compass rose upon a sea of blue.  Moonlight bleeds through the opaque panels and lends the area an silvery hue."
