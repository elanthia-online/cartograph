    "The floor of the expansive chamber is crafted of dark, mahogany planks.  The center is dominated by a circular oaken table, burnished to an almost mirror-like sheen.  Some wide snowcat pelt armchairs surround the table, their plush seats covered in matching fabric.  Carved sideboards flank a small stone hearth under an embossed cedar carving depicting the mule statue found in Town Center with a tiny ancient halfling asleep at its base.  A colorful abstract oil painting in an electrum frame has been hung on the wall opposite the head of the table."
