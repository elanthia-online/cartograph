    "Two low archways, running east and west, are the only openings in the circular walls.  The western archway leads out onto the northern parapet, while through the eastern archway you can make out the dilapidated skeleton of what was once the northeastern tower.  An iron ladder has been bolted into the southern wall, dust adding to the thick layers of rust."
