  "description": [
    "High winds battered the north face of Mount Aenatumgana, breaking off chunks of rock constantly, forming a cliff that towers over a thousand feet into the sky.  Sleet and snow cling doggedly to the crag, making an assault to reach the summit impossible from this vantage.  Stinging ice hammers into the lower corners of the cliff, breaking loose anything without solid roots and blowing away snow trying to cling to the little protection offered by the rock."
