    "The silvery moonlight reveals an expanse of blackberry brambles cut by a serpentine path lying directly below the balcony.  Beyond, River's Rest appears in a greyscale pattern of rooftops and trees.  From the north the sound of rushing water rises above the bluffs that line the north branch of the Tempest River.  The roof of the Stone Eye Inn glimmers above the trees to the northwest, while the dome of the Pavilion of the Bells reflects pale starlight to the southeast."
