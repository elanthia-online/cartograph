    "Sunlight slips through the thick foliage where the seeking vines have parted to allow the ocean breeze to taunt denizens as they pass through the steaming heat of dense jungle.  Indigo striations and veining touch upon the broad, speckled leaves of the nightsparkle that lines the twining black sand pathway.  Taunting its brethren, a lyrebird calls out a siren's song that sounds suspiciously like a string of curses issued by a sailor from the pier of Caligos proper.",

Indigo striations and veining touch upon the broad, speckled leaves of the nightsparkle that lines the twining black sand pathway.  Chirping and cooing into the night, several nightjars lend their voice to the damp air."
