  "description": [
    "Towering poles laden with heavy line stretch across the cobblestone pathway where thick panels of recently dyed sailcloth dry in the seaborne breeze.  Additional clotheslines are erected beyond the protective guardrail that separates the road from a steep incline of untamed beach grasses terminating in jagged rocks slick with sea spray.  Just beyond the patchwork of color, a bright white shop is the source of an acrid chemical smell that fills the air."
