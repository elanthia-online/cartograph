    "The double-layered planking of Baron's Bridge Road continues its north-south run amidst the wooden structures that are characteristic of South 'Haven.  Large, potted yews stand at the corners of the intersection, passable stand-ins for free-growing trees in this built-on-a-platform section of Solhaven."
