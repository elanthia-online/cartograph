    "The generous girth of the limbs providing a framework for passageways high above the forest floor offers a safe promenade from tree to tree.  Birds sing among the black leaves robing the smaller branches, creating splashes of color against the dark foliage.  A break in the canopy offers a view of a rock-bordered stream crossing the forest floor below.",
