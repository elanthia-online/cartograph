    "Draped in pale silk, tall arching windows look out over a wide, verdant lawn with blooming flowerbeds that create a kaleidoscope of color.  A few chairs circle an unfinished needlework in a large circular frame.  Several sofas cushioned in shades of pastel are placed about the room, a brass tea cart resting nearby.  Fragrant arrangements of fresh roses are set about the room, filling it with their sweet scent."
