    "In this mid-sized room, pale green silk covers the walls, and a slightly darker green carpet pads the floor.  A white lace coverlet lies atop a four poster bed.  A pot sprouting spearmint sprigs sits on the sill of a stained glass window.  Wrought iron wall sconces hold mint-scented candles to illuminate the room."
