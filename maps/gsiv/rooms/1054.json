    "Moonlight beams down to illuminate the moor for miles all around.  Mists stir in pockets throughout the area, buffeted by a slight breeze.  Tall grasses spread out as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the presence of scattered boulders of different sizes that protrude up through the green carpet.  The breeze buffets the top of the grass, moving across it in slow waves to give the grass the appearance of a rolling, dark green sea.",
