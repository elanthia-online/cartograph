    "The area explodes in a frenzy of activity as numerous small slithering animals are disturbed by the arrival of footsteps.  The moss undulates outward, pushed up by the escaping creatures underneath, then settles back peacefully, and the area returns to its unnatural quiet.  To the southwest the path seems to take a sudden dip downward."
