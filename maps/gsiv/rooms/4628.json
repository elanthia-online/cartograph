    "Dimly lit by kraken-oil lamps, the interior of the Sea Troll's Kitchen is crowded with upholstered booths at each point of the compass except due south.  The center of the south wall is taken up by the order counter, and the diner's jawbone doorway stands opposite it between the north and northeast booths.  Obviously shooting for that cozy, run-down waterfront diner atmosphere, with booths that are far past their prime, it's not clear whether \"cozy\" or \"run-down\" is the dominant element."
