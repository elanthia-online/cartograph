    "Massive obsidian columns line this hall and support a ceiling decorated with scenes of classic battles.  The walls are thickly hung with trophies and weapons of war mingled with the preserved remains of many a gruesome creature.  An arabesqued carpet leads you north down the hallway.  The heavy iron door leads back out to the courtyard."
