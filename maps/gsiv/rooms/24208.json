    "Gaping holes in the ceiling are edged with black slime where the thatching has rotted away and allow splotches of moonlight to trickle into the dank room.  Roughened oak boards form the walls, though they display heavy signs of water damage and in places appear to be decomposing.  A long rough counter acts as guardian for the open door that rests off-kilter to its frame."
