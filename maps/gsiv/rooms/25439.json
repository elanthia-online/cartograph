  "description": [
    "Decorated in muted dark tones, the small showroom features an elegantly carved ebony coffin to one side and a velvet-draped table to the other.  A simple dark grey curtain partially obscures a doorway leading to the back of the wagon.  One of the candles has been snuffed out on the far wall, leaving a corner shrouded in shadow."
