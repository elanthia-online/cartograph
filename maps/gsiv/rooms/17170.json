    "Bound by thick cords, spotted leopard pelts lay in a heap outside of an overturned coffer.  On a countertop in the rear of the room, clear jars are filled with an assortment of various-sized brass studs.  Displayed on the opposite end of the counter are shiny buckles that can be used to adorn almost any style boots or shoes."
