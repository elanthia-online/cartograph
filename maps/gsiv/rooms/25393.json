    "Clouds of dust and dried rodent feces billow up with even the lightest passing footstep.  Nails protrude downward from the low, slanted roofline overhead, posing significant threat to the taller races.  Perched atop a decapitated rocking horse, a small eyeless troll doll holds on tightly to unattached remnants of reins."
