    "Grimy, smoky lanterns cast shadows in the front of the tiny shop, and the scent of wood shavings and oil lingers heavily in the air.  Several crates and barrels are stacked up against one wall, while a pair of mannequins display wares on the other side of the room.  A moth-eaten curtained partition leads further into the shop.",
