  "description": [
    "The trail narrows then bends back upon itself, winding through the blanket of grass with irrational abandon.  A shudder within the thick verdure is accompanied by a snarl and brief tussle.  Then a wild cat leaps over the trail, carrying a limp rabbit in its jaws, and disappears again into the overgrowth."
