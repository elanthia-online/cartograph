    "This is the darkest table in the room, not only because it's lacking a candle, but because it is the furthest away from any source of light in the room.  The black silk tablecloth is plain and devoid of embroidery.  On the table is a figure which represents Sheru, a black furred jackal's head with yellow eyes that shimmer with a light of their own."
