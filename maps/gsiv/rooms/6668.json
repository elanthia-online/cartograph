    "Tall bookshelves of dark modwir and ashwood line the walls, their glaes panels revealing glimpses of arcane tomes in languages you cannot begin to comprehend.  A large wooden table rests in the center of the room, illuminated by several small oil-fueled reading lamps, though no one seems to be studying here right now."
