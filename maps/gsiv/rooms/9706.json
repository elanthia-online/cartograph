  "description": [
    "The trail loops out of one break in the trees and back into another, skirting the edge of a beautiful lake in its progress.  Rushes and cattails growing at the waterline fringe a few large boulders in a picturesque tableau.  The stones are eloquently mirrored on the water's immaculate surface, the reflection faintly rippled with breezes blowing from offshore."
