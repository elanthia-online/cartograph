  "description": [
    "The overhanging roof of the Silvermule Gaming Hall shades a narrow alleyway that forms a niche between the uneven dark stone back walls of the establishment and opens to the north.  A few empty crates and barrels have been stacked against the stone, and it is hard to tell if they are waiting to be disposed of or filled with something."
