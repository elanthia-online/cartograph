    "Just a few square feet in area, the balcony provides a spectacular view of the city.  Ivy engulfs the semicircle of railing around the balcony, its vibrant green color contrasting with the darkly stained wood.  Looking to the inn's roof, the drake-shaped weather vane can be seen, slightly squeaking with each breeze.",
