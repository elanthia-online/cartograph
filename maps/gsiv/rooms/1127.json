  "description": [
    "A creek drops over a short cliff side here, creating a small waterfall and pool before continuing on to the northwest.  Water striders rush across the pool pursued by tadpoles, and a few mosquitoes quietly flit around the area, apparently not concerned about your presence at all.  The cliff is high enough and crumbly enough that it blocks progress along the creek to the east.  The trail strikes out into the forest to the southeast and follows the creek to the northwest."
