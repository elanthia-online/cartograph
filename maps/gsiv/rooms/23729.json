    "Constructed of stone and mortar, the small alcove is semicircular in shape and scrubbed until the stones glisten with a brilliant white gleam.  Golden light spills from the apex of the ceiling's curve where a metallic sun fashioned of glass and backlit by candles blazes amid an azure backdrop painted into the smooth stones.  A low altar, draped with a simple cloth, resides along the back wall with a simple pew set before it, while a thick azure drape leads into a small enclosure."
