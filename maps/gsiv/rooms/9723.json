    "As the path threads its way through rocky scree, it passes large boulders and thick patches of nettles.  A tree with pitch-black foliage and contorted proportions occupies the entire southern vista.  Hundreds of crows sit in its branches, making a chaotic racket with their caws and squawks.",

A tree with pitch-black foliage and contorted proportions occupies the entire southern vista.  Bats wheel and dive around the tree's dark form, their fleet forms silhouetted in the moonlight."
