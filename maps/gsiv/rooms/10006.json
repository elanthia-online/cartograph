    "Piles of jagged rocks fill the end of the ravine, deposited by some long-ago landslide or explosion that has completely concealed whatever route the ancient stream that carved out the ravine took to disappear into the earth.  A steep ladder of crude stairs extends up the north wall, transformed by the rubble and muddy runoff from above into an unstable and treacherous climb."
