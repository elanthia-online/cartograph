    "Casting a soft blue glow across the shop's dark interior is a number of potted luminescent toadstools.  The radiant fungi are gathered neatly around a mistwood counter and the matching cabinet that sit against the far wall.  A large terrarium sits in the middle of the mahogany floor, with a wide banner suspended from the ceiling above."
