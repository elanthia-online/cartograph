    "Lazily etching its way over the ground, a small stream moves over multiple rock ledges resembling a stairway.  Thick ground ferns line the waterway, their long fronds hanging over the bank to gently caress the surface.  Air, thick with moisture, coats the plants with a glossy sheen.  Small purple fruits lay scattered on the ground about the stands of white-barked trees that give ample shade to the area."
