    "An eagle swoops close, keeping a keen eye on you, then floats away over the forest in search of a meal.  To the east the conifer forest of the Whistler's Pass area fills the floor between the peaks, and even further east another forest appears, although there is something strangely wrong about it.  From this distance details are not quite apparent, but the trees somehow seem misshapen and the forest's hue seems much too dark.",
