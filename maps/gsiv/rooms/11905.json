    "The path near the city wall is composed of chocolate-brown clay, cracked and chipped in places where it has dried after a season of heavy rains.  Extending out from the remains of the city gate, it wends its way up hills covered in bushes and a dense growth of deciduous trees, then drops from sight as it ducks behind a bend in the distance."
