    "Many of the tiles that make up the portico walkway here are scratched and broken.  Against the wall is a bench on which drowsy footpads rest.  The air is tinged with the slight smell of sweat.  An exquisite brass lantern hangs from the portico rafters.  To the southwest is a salmon-colored awning."
