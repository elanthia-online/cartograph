  "description": [
    "Some slabs of loose shale and crumbling rocks of the canyon floor appear to have been arranged here, forming small teetering stacks and squat piles.  Near a small, dwarf-sized niche in the rock wall, a semi-circle of stones has been constructed, its interior sheltering a single, partially-burnt branch from the ravaging wind."
