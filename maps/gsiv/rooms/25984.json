  "description": [
    "Diffuse moonlight illuminates the pale interlocking stones of a cobbled walkway  that leads up to an ornate mistwood gate set into a low greystone wall. Fragrant bushes of blooming alabaster roses line either side of the entrance, their light petals highlighted by the soft luminescence from above."
