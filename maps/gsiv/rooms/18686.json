    "The building is cylindrical and two stories, with a mistwood staircase spiraling upwards in the center of the room.  Matching railings rim the second floor, which overlooks the shelves and cases built into the curving lower wall.  The single arched doorway is framed by two octagonal windows, each of which is paned in sapphire glass."
