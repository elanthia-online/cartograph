    "Wide basalt pillars, some spaced for tiny halfling steps and some for the widest giantkin stride, form an impressive causeway against the side of the mountain.  The windblown alpine tundra blooms with wildflowers on either side of the stairs, which are covered with a variety of mosses and lichens."
