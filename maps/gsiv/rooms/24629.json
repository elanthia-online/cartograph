  "description": [
    "Chairs with pale green cushions and padded arms have been placed around the room, their soft hue a compliment to the warmth of the wagon's oak walls.  Beneath the flickering flames of nearby gilt-based lamps, an oak leaf-carved table and a silver harp-inlaid table guard the outer edges of this space, leaving the center aisle open so shoppers can browse.  A silk banner hangs above each of the tables, their respective elven house crests painted in vibrant colors on the fine-spun fabric."
