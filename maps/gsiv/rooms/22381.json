    "A dim light filters in through several brick-lined clefts in the ceiling overhead, dappling the underground cavern in alternating bands of light and shadow.  The meager illumination is enough to allow the growth of a garden, cultivated carefully into the appearance of a wild and naturally occurring place.  Paths wind through the vegetation and several statues are set out amidst the foliage.  An arched portal leads out of the open pocket."
