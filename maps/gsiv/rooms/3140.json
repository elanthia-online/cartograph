    "A frozen, timeless garden has taken on deeper beauty in the icy permafrost covering this tiny glade.  Tall red roses with kisses of white neighbor delicate crystalline violets that would shatter at the slightest touch.  Slender ivy vines caress a polished wood bench dusted with a light covering of snow."
