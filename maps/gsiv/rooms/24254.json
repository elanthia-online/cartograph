    "Swaths of pale blue silk hang loosely from the wrought iron frame of this three-sided pavilion.  Open on one side, the moss-draped shadow of the fallen tree along the Banyan Cirque provides a natural feeling to this otherwise pristine establishment.  Plush carpets of a deep indigo color cover the floor, while a long low table set against the far wall displays the shop's wares.  Small paper lanterns provide a warm ambiance and ample light in which to peruse the merchandise."
