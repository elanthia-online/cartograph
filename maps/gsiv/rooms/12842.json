  "description": [
    "An arc of shifting colors of light hangs mesmerizingly suspended in midair above the strand.  A series of uniformly sized globes of pure silver sit atop height-graduated pedestals of black marble around the outer perimeter of the clear feldspar-flagstoned area.  Upon a black ora flat about three feet high and six feet wide sits a large, shallow glass disk, in a manner allowing it to tilt at different angles.  Elaborate silver-leaf scrollwork chains and spirals along the surface edges of the flat."
