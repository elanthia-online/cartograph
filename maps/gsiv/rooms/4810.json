    "The elegant velvet sofas and wing chairs that once decorated this room are now slashed and faded.  Delicate end tables lie shattered and broken, covered with dust.  A large painting over the fireplace is no longer discernible, its canvas having been slashed numerous times.  A doorway on the northern wall stands open, the door nowhere to be seen."
