    "The path rises to the southwest, climbing atop a bluff as the river is forced into a narrower channel.  Here, upstream from the funnel, the river placidly spreads out, small eddies and whirlpools playing at the edges of the water.  The sun sparkles off the river's pristine surface, reflecting warmly on the trees and bushes gathered at the shore.  To the north the trail winds in and out of the maples and elms.",
