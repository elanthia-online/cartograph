  "description": [
    "Just paces away to the west, a wall of igneous rock breaches out of the swampy depths below and continues for another hundred feet before tapering toward a jagged point, like a talon pointing toward the cavern's distant ceiling.  That pace is an impossible one, as empty air and a drop into fathomless blackness separates the portal's plateau from the taller rock formation."
