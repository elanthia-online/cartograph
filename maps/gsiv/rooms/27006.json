    "Pulsating red light baths the golden tiles in their ethereal glow, the source a protective hemisphere of arcana that flashes and ripples with contained energy.  Beyond the construct, darkness spreads its web across the sky and captures brilliant stars in its path.  Several steps lead into a sunken crater ring that is lined with brightly glowing red glass tiles."
