    "A long counter separates the front part of the office from the rear, where a smaller desk is laden with stacks of parchment and books.  An elderly woman sits behind the desk and quietly attends to her workload.  A door behind her is clearly marked, \"Headmaster's Office\" and looks otherwise off limits.  A row of benches fill the eastern wall, some of them taken up by children with appointments to see the headmaster.",
