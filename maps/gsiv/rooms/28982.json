  "description": [
    "Framed in carved cocobolo, a long white parchment guide is mounted on the eastern wall, the starlight reflecting off of its glass-covered surface, while below it, fabric and wood dress forms stand on display.  Green shutters frame open, glass-free windows in the western wall, each providing a view of the streets beyond and bringing cool air into the narrow hallway.  Cushioned wicker armchairs are scattered about the golden linden floor, providing comfortable places for repose."
