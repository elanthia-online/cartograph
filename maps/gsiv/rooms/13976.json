    "The heavy stench of smoke and ozone tears at your eyes.  Long wooden tables fill the center of the room, their surfaces covered with beakers, oil burners, and other vials filled with multicolored liquids.  At the front of the classroom, an elderly man sits behind a heavy desk and behind him a slate stone board with today's potion assignment scrawled out.",
    "The lingering stench of smoke and ozone fills the air.  Long wooden tables sit in the center of the room, their surfaces mostly clean, save for a few scorch marks and holes that appear to have been eaten by acid.  At the front of the classroom, a heavy desk is completely clean as well as the slate stone board that hangs behind it.",
    "Starcharts, miniature parchment models of constellations, and a variety of telescopes line the walls of the small classroom.  Children sit quietly in their seats playing with brass astrolabes as they follow along with the teacher at the head of the class.  Several small windows are inset into a wall, allowing just enough room to view the outside."
