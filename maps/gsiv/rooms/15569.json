    "Crimson eahnor is worked in intricate designs upon the dark grey marble floor, the gleaming metal's surface set afire by the numerous orbs of warm amber light hovering in mid-air.  A small arched door, a dark onyx door, and a dark steel door break up the monotony of the north wall, while the southern end of the chamber leads to a spiral staircase that ascends further up into the tower's reach."
