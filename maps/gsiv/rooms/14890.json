  "description": [
    "Jutting out from the promontory of the end of the ridgeline, this overlook of barren rock provides a spectacular viewpoint.  Placed here for those wanting respite or a moment to enjoy the scenery, a crude wooden bench faces the northwest stretch of the valley.  At the tip of the bluff, a break in the treeline reveals a switchback trail leading down the hillside."
