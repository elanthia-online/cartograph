    "The dusty white walls of the tent are made of thick canvas and ornamented with a series of brass, silver and gold gears, each of varying sizes.  In the middle of the room is a small pen enclosed by copper-posted fencing.  A bronze-eyed burghal gnome kicks his feet while perched upon a metal stool, his nose flaring while he tinkers away on a mechanical toy."
