    "A thin sheen of water covers the ground in the southern portion of the barley fields.  Cloying mud sticks to shoes and feet as if the soil is filled with glue. Bad drainage apparently has backed up the rainwater, and the barley plants here are definitely not happy about it.  The plants are much shorter than those in the fields to the north and lack the dark coloration prevalent in healthy plants.  The area could definitely benefit from the digging of a drainage ditch.",
