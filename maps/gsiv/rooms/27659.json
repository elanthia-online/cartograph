    "In this section of the gallery, multiple white globes of essence dance overhead, their light reflected by the walls of solid ice.  Waves of essence pulse periodically throughout the room, keeping the walls in their frigid state.  The soft voices of other guests echo as mere whispers from the west.  A mounted circle of ornaments hangs above a handwoven tapestry, while on the opposite wall, an immense oil portrayal of two women figures in a carved mistwood frame is displayed.  A series of larger-than-life portraits on snow white easels is featured in the center of the gallery."
