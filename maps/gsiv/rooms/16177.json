    "Though stairs have been built to access the cottage upstairs, the rest of the basement resembles an untouched cavern.  Moss grows along the rock walls and climbs from floor to ceiling in unfettered majesty, the deep green and rust colors painting a natural picture along the perimeter.  Barrels, driftwood, rocks, and crates have been laid out upon the floor, serving as makeshift shelving that sits unevenly on the wet and musty floor."
