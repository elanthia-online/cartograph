  "description": [
    "The hot water contained in the pool seems almost unbearable at first touch.  However, within moments, the temperature mellows to comfortable, and shortly thereafter, it's positively luxurious.  Stone steps leading into its deeper center make perfect places to sit at whatever depth one prefers, ranging from barely waist deep for a halfling to chin deep for a giantman."
