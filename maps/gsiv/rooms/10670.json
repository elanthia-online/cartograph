    "Thick oak boles running from the ceiling into the floor serve as anchor points for dozens of burlap hammocks.  Arranged in tiers four deep, the hammocks do not offer very spacious or comfortable accommodation, especially were all of them filled at once.  The odors of stale sweat and rotting burlap dominate an air scented with a potpourri of unwholesome smells."
