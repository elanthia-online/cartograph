    "Heavy pieces of leather and fur hang from the walls of this cramped room and serve to dampen the sounds of the workshop somewhat.  Dwarven apprentices and craftsmen work diligently at various tables and forging anvils located around the room.  In the center of the room sits a large mithril-plated table and a heavy mithril anvil, both located conveniently close to the blazing furnace at the rear of the room."
