  "description": [
    "This end of the hallway is quieter, its hardwood floor muffled by a large burgundy-colored rug.  Potted plants, well-watered but looking a bit starved for sun in their dark corners, stand on two elaborate brass tables on either side of a richly carved mahogany door at the end of the hall.",
    "The end of the hallway is enclosed by large burgundy rugs.  Potted plants are displayed on brass stands resting between a polished maoral door and a richly carved mahogany door.  The dark corridor doesn't offer much in terms of natural lighting."
