    "A thin cast iron railing separates this riverstone-paved octagonal patio from a field of blooming wildflowers bordered on a far edge by a line of great oaks and magnolia trees.  Centered in the patio is a polished wood workbench that is accompanied by a weathered red wood cabinet covered in simple carvings of local fauna.  Just beyond the railing, a wood rack sits with several poles hung with browning herb leaves and stalks.",
