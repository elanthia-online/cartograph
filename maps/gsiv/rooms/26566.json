  "description": [
    "The water stains at the base of the walls have been scrubbed, though not with any manner of determination as much of the discoloration remains.  Likewise, the air is haunted by the vague scent of mildew stirred by the occasional breath of sea salt.  Bereft of a bed, this room boasts only a seal skin rug and a circular teak bookcase."
