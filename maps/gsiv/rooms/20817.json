    "You are in a rectangular stone room which contains a glowing cobalt obelisk emanating a soft humming sound.  Under an intricate stained glass window is a statue of a half-elf cleric on horseback.  On the far side of the room stands a luxurious bed covered with soft furs and jewel-colored silken pillows."
