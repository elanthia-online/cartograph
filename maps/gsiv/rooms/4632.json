    "A sense of serenity blankets the glade, undisturbed by the drifting breeze that dances around the surrounding trees.  In the distance, Sylvarraend is merely a collection of pinpoints of light in the tranquil darkness.  Cast in cool moonlight, twelve white stones encircle a pale limestone altar that houses the occasional tribute to this shrine celebrating the quiet beauty of nature.",
    "A sense of serenity blankets the glade, undisturbed by the drifting breeze that dances around the surrounding trees.  Lush grass is spotted by the occasional wildflower, a florid island amidst an ocean of green.  Twelve white stones encircle a pale limestone altar that houses the occasional tribute to this shrine celebrating the quiet beauty of nature."
