    "[Inside Tree, Narrow Tunnel]"

  "description": [
    "Dark walls stretch upwards to create a narrow, rounded tunnel.  Slime pulses out from the walls, the thick ooze dripping down to coat thousands of small wiry roots that twitch and move of their own accord.  The pale, worm-like roots currently have a tenuous grasp upon your body, and the same cilia-like structures above stretch down toward you, as if vying for a grip."
