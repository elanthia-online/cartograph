    "Dark stains have been splattered around a rusted spearhead that has been imbedded into the northern wall.  Despite the freely flowing water to and from the east, the passage has been blocked by the shattered remnants of collapsed statues.  An arched doorway remains open along the southern wall, the door itself having long since rotted away."
