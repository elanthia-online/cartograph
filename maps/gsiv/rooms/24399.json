    "From this small platform, a large expanse of pristine forest can be seen on three sides.  The occasional deer prances across the leaf-covered forest floor, oblivious to the observers in the tree house.  The small glade to the east is mostly hidden by the great oak tree which is connected to this scenic rest spot by the narrow rope bridge."
