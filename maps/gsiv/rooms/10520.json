    "Hanging from a nearby tree branch, a translucent husk from a limbless reptile billows gently on a delicate but foul smelling breeze.  Finger-like tendrils from a rising mist creep slowly over the dampened ground and partially conceal a nest filled with more discarded husks.  Every so often a low, menacing hissing sound is audible near a small body of tea-colored water.  Dead foliage covers the surface of the water."
