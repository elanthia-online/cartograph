    "Thick, blue smoke hovers near the curved ceiling, the aroma of pipe tobacco clinging to the wares displayed in wire baskets suspended from large metal hooks affixed to the rafters.  Stocked shelves line the wall behind a heavily lacquered countertop piled high with unopened boxes and string-wrapped packages.  A small lantern sputters atop a low table next to an overstuffed chair in one corner, an ancient-looking tabby cat curled up on a worn footstool nearby."
