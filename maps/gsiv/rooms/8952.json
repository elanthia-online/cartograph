    "A solitary lamp stands atop a single rusty post. The other lamps and posts that lined the row have completely rusted away, leaving pitted stumps of flaking iron.  An unfinished carving of a noose is scratched into the weathered, faded paint, a remnant of a disrupted attempt to leave a signal for one of the town's seedier residents."
