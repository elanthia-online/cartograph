    "Natural disasters aspire to produce the sort of disorganized mess that is present within this small wagon.  Piles of gaudy costumes lie crumpled in a corner, and a large mithril letter \"P\" has been bolted to the far wall.  The single window in the wagon is broken, though no signs of shattered glass remain.  The plain white cloth covering a round tanik table is stained numerous colors, and assorted merchandise sits on the table, strewn between empty mugs.  An iron-banded oak keg with a brass spigot is set up amid a pile of empty bottles."
