  "description": [
    "The bottom of a wide chamber is strewn with both jagged crags of glaes and splinters of bleached bones, which pepper the tumbled floor like broken teeth.  The detritus fairly gleams in the shadows, its light color offset dramatically by the black rock.  Far overhead, the black maw of an opening is visible near the cavern's ceiling, where a higher tunnel leads away through smoke and gloom."
