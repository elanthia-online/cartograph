    "A pair of crossed leather-wrapped maces hang above a hand-carved modwir sleighbed.  On the right side of the bed, a blanket is draped over the back of a rocking chair.  Piled in front of the partially bricked-up fireplace are blackened logs and a box of tinder.  Tiny footprints from some kind of rodent are visible through the ashes that have been scattered across the hearth."
