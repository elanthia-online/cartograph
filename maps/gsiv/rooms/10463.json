    "The inward curving keep wall to the south and west protects the grassy sward of the inner keep.  A few festive colored kiosks have been placed near the western wall allowing the merchants within an unobstructed view to the east.  A couple people can be seen diligently carting goods to and from various destinations around the area.",
    "The inward curving keep wall to the south and west protects the grassy sward of the inner keep.  A few kiosks have been placed under the shadow of the western wall allowing the merchants within an unobstructed view to the east.  Illuminated by only a few scattered torches, a few people can be seen diligently carting goods to and from various destinations around the moonlit area."
