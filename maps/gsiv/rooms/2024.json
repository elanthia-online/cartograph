    "Large trees arch their heavy branches over a moonlit beach, which stretches from a dark tangle of gargantuan roots at the foot of the forest to the brink of parallel rows of breakers edging a bay.  Night birds wheel overhead, their dark wings whispering in the gloom.  A sultry breeze blows in off the water, carrying the smell of the ocean like a perfume.",
    "Large trees arch their heavy branches over a white sand beach, which stretches from a tangle of gargantuan roots at the foot of the forest to the brink of parallel rows of breakers edging a turquoise bay.  Long-legged sea birds quip and trot along the foamy, packed sand, picking at bits of shells and kelp.  A sultry breeze blows in off the water, carrying the smell of the ocean like a perfume."
