    "A noble elf maiden portrait hangs on one of the patterned white walls, and a cerulean cloud-painted ceiling rises overhead.  A verdant elderberry bush sits in one corner of a buffed cherrywood floor.  There is a gold-trimmed ebonwood chest on one side of the shop and a large oak table on the other."
