    "A shooting star blazes briefly across the night sky, then seems to fall to the ground an immeasurable distance to the east.  The thin night air carries a chill into even the warmest of clothing.",
    "A flock of small, black birds arranged in strict military precision crosses one corner of the sky.  Their movement is observed by a solitary hawk turning circles as it hides in the direction of the sun."
