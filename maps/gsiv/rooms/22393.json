  "description": [
    "Vivid tapestries depicting the snow-capped peaks of the DragonSpine adorn the wall opposite a pair of tall bay windows.  The well-lit chamber is furnished with a pair of matching settees set behind two glaes-topped tables, and several chairs crafted in the same motif are arranged at adjacent positions for additional seating.  A mithril-traced sideboard offers several distinctly dwarven refreshments."
