    "An armor-clad figure slouches against a post in the center of the courtyard, like a derelict sentry on an interminable night watch.  The figure bears a rusting falchion in its drooping right arm, as if it were guarding the stairs leading up to the balcony.  A paper target tacked to the side of the barracks seems to have been used for archery practice."
