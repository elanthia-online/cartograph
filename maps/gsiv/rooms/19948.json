  "description": [
    "This small room is crammed from floor to ceiling with shelves and cases.  All varieties of artifacts rest on their surfaces.  A row of goblin skulls on a high shelf transitions from prehistoric to modern day, and several bulbous eyeballs in clear glass jars glint from the shelf below, reflecting light from the glass-paned oil lanterns that dot the room.  On the north wall, a narrow door rests between two tall cabinets, while to the south, a bloody tapestry ripples slightly in an occasional cold draft."
