    "Panels of lacquered maple are fitted together in the center of the room, creating a large dance floor.  The placement of the wood tiles in various directions makes unique patterns and enhances the natural grain.  Banners of crimson and blue hang from the supports above.  Silver stands filled with candles encircle the space, their bright light casting shadows across the silk walls.  A variety of silk-cushioned chairs are placed about a thick carpet that surrounds the central area."
