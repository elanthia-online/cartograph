    "Walls of cherry-stained satinwood surround deep leather chairs with claw-footed tables alongside.  The eastern wall is completely taken over by shelves of liquor, from the common to the exotic, arranged in neat rows behind a long wooden bar, while tall carved-legged stools offer a place to sit at the bar.  A stuffed brown otter stands on a pedestal in one corner, its fur a bit tattered where numerous hands have rubbed its belly.  An ivory chandelier illuminates the area, and a red satinwood archway leads to a dimly lit room."
