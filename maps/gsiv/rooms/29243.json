  "description": [
    "Knobby knees of ancient bald cypress jut upwards sporadically through the brackish, standing water in this low-lying section of the Weald.  Long-legged insects, with pale-carapiced bodies splay cautiously atop the water, exploiting the surface tension to avoid an untimely demise.  The bloated carcass of a stiff-bristled boar lies half-submerged in the shallows, reminding the wise of the dangers lurking in the forest."
