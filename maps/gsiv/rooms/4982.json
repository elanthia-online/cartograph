    "An unexplainable wind howls throughout this cyclopean chamber, kicking up and stirring huge clouds of dust.  Columns of stalagmites dot the surface of the ground.  They appear to have been artfully arranged by the creators of the caverns themselves.  Some are so tall they seem to be connecting with the stalactites on the ceiling."
