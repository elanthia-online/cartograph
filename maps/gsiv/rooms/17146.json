    "Streaks of soot from the burning torches blacken the walls and ceiling.  The flickering light from the torches generates a series of dancing shadows along the walls and floor.  On a peg flanked by a reinforced eahnor door and a reinforced faenor door, hangs a single key that can be used to unbolt each cell in this block.  Subdued reverberations of boots on metal and distant murmurs and chuckling from an unknown speaker break the otherwise oppressive mood of the corridor."
