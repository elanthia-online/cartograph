    "Wisps of fog snake along the top of the plateau, sometimes obscuring the narrow path through short green bushes of salal and wax myrtle broken with patches of fragrant wild beach roses.  Small glass-encased lanterns light the way along crooked wooden stairs guided by a shaky rope handrail threaded through the eyes of iron posts.  Another layer of coastal marine mist wavers overhead, often hiding and revealing an indigo star-filled sky, mimicking the wave activity on the black sand beach below.",
    "Lush green flora covers the top of the plateau, benefitting from the misty coastal fog that coalesces each day.  Short green bushes of salal and wax myrtle are broken with patches of bright pink wild beach roses basking in the sun, their delicate petals ruffled by a constant breeze.  A shaky rope handrail threaded through the eyes of iron posts assists along the crooked wooden stairs traversing to a black sand beach stretching as far as the eye can see.",
