    "Striped snowcat pelts decorate the walls, their tawny and black striped hides meshing nicely with the abundance of trailing plants twining from gold-plated containers hanging on the walls.  A low platform piled with a variety of furs creates a comfortable bed.  Honey-colored tallow candles flicker in their cast iron holders, their tiny shades of beaded topaz glowing with a golden light."
