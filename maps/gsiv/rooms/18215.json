    "A variety of plants and murals decorate the light modwir paneled walls here.  One wall is covered entirely with books while another wall, directly behind Grandmaster's desk is almost entirely made of glass stretching from floor to ceiling.  Where the modwir paneling is visible, it is intricately carved with scenes of the Lords of Liabo at rest, play or in battle.",
