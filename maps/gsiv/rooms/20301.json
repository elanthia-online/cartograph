    "Velvet jade curtains drape down from above, encasing the area in a vibrant green hue.  Candle-laden fixtures hang from the tented ceiling, illuminating the tent, save for a shadowy velvet curtain.  Showcased in the center of the area, a large painting housed in an ironwood frame sits on a gilded easel."
