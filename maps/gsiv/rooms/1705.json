    "Filtered moonlight shines through the window of the small, tidy hut, casting a silvery stripe across the woven rug in front of the blazing fireplace.  A wooden table and matching chairs sit below the window.  On the opposite wall is a neatly made bed covered by an earth-toned quilt.  At its foot, a wooden stand holds a tiny black-faced monkey securely attached to the stand by a leather harness and leash.",
    "Filtered sunlight shines through the window of the small, tidy hut, illuminating idly mingling dust motes and casting a stripe of warmth across the woven rug in front of the unlit fireplace.  A wooden table and matching chairs sit below the window.  On the opposite wall is a neatly made bed covered by an earth-toned quilt.  At its foot, a wooden stand holds a tiny black-faced monkey securely attached to the stand by a leather harness and leash."
