  "description": [
    "Winding paths lead up over the high, grass-covered dunes that line the northern sections of the beach, while along the south the tide ebbs and flows in a rhythmic fashion.  Bamboo torches, tall and straight, stand dormant just out beyond the tideline, the sun-bleached lengths hardened and devoid of lacquer.  A spiraling wooden staircase winds its way from the ground to the second-story entry of a conical-roofed bungalow built on stilts, a wide sailcloth banner attached to its railings displays a bright red painting with tidy letters beneath."
