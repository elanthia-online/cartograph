  "description": [
    "Frigid blasts of sea water and foam launch themselves rhythmically against the outermost pilings of the pier above.  Ducking the spray proves a futile endeavor as each incoming wave disperses with force against the stalwart wooden obstacles.  Shallow, foam-topped pools empty and fill in the spaces between the largest, shore-hugging boulders."
