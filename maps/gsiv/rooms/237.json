    "Interspersed among the small shops along the cobbled road are a few modwir-shingled private houses.  They are gaily decorated, competing for individuality with one another by means of daubs of colorful paint, skillfully carved doors and shutters, and window boxes bursting with ornamental flowers and fresh herbs.  A bright yellow awning lit by a glowing lamp marks the entrance to the florist, whose windows are brimming with fresh blossoms.",
