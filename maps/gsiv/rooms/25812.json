    "A circle of colorfully painted chairs surrounds a stone-lined fire pit just above the tide line on this white sand beach.  Elaborately constructed sand castles, towers, wagons and gers are displayed across the surface of the beach.  Colorful crustaceans of assorted size occasionally make their way around the driftwood and seaweed that has washed up on shore.  A blue modwir dock extends from the beach and out into the waves."
