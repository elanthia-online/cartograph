  "description": [
    "The castle yard is bordered here by a quaint, old chapel on the east and the flanking tower of the inner castle wall on the west.  The tower looks to be three stories in height at least, and is topped by a crow-stepped gable.  To the north, the castle yard stops at the foot of a sizable wall."
