    "Simulacra of the pantheon of Lornon have been skillfully etched into the smooth limestone walls.  Arranged about the alcove are several gleaming brass censers, their tendrils of smoke forming lacy patterns that dissipate quickly in the air.  A handful of simple prayer mats encircle a carved black marble altar."
