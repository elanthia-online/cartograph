    "The dim light from the exit falls upon blood-splattered walls and the floor, covered with dried blood and gore, is littered with piles of broken weapons and pieces of destroyed armor -- mute evidence of the dreadful battle that was waged here.  No sane person would choose to linger in this cave filled with the stench of death."
