    "The broad sweep of the slate floor is interrupted by a leaping dolphin statuette.  Halfway to the wooden ceiling, a faded treasure map hangs on one of the textured sandstone walls.  A shell-lined bamboo counter and an aqua-hued seaglass display are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
