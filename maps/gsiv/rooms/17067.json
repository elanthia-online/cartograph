    "The light in the room is provided by three torches set into rusted iron sconces mounted on the stone walls, though stars twinkle through and moonlight enters from a sizeable hole in the ceiling.  A single window, its glass long absent, provides the entry for a waterfall of brown and green vines that crawl across the floor to the base of a workbench.  Randomly located throughout the room are black singe marks accompanied by the faint smell of ash."
