    "Shelves of books line the walls, many appearing much older than the guildhall itself.  Thick carpeting absorbs the whispered voices of those present and muffles your every step into silence.  A heavy canvas drape is suspended across an open doorway in the northern wall, allowing easy access into the room while protecting it from the distraction and noise of passersby in the hallway."
