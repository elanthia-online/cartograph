  "description": [
    "You are at the part of the dock that extends just short of the high water mark, to judge from the more-or-less sound condition of the deck planks and reinforcing beams.  From time to time, an unusually large wave breaks against the seaward supports and causes the whole structure to shake and sway dizzyingly.  The view out over the bay is magnificent, but you hesitate to linger here."
