  "description": [
    "Cold and damp, the tower interior is smaller than expected though roomy enough to feel comfortable even in a large group.  The smell of the sea is still strong here, providing a musty flavor to the air.  A circular stairway leads to a landing above you, but the upper portion of it is scorched and twisted."
