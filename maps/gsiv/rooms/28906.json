  "description": [
    "Colorful pennants and banners snap and flutter in the consistent seaborne breeze from their position along the roof of a narrow log-sided hall, their colorful ends and metallic threading sparkling in the sunlight.  Voices rise and fall from the west where the open-air market is in full swing, while the sound of industry travels in from the east.  A large sign post planted in the ground has several arrow-shaped planks nailed to it, each scribbled with tiny letters and images."
