    "Obviously proud of his work, the shop owner has gone to great expense to elaborately frame several life-sized portraits of the specialty chairs his family has created for several generations.  Great gilded borders lend an elegance to the paintings displayed on the walls, much like an art gallery.  Behind a tidy carved rosewood desk sits a fashionably-attired clerk, ready to greet customers as they enter."
