    "An ancient black oak stands just to the north, turning the trail northwest across its sprawling roots and up a gentle rise in the uneven hillside.  A heavy, woodsy scent of moss and loam fills the air, drifting on the night breeze in a quiet rhythm with the shifting patterns of moonlight on the ground.",
