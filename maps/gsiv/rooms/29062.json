  "description": [
    "An orderly arrangement of mismatched planks is supported on either side by two carved wooden figureheads set securely into the soil.  One of the busty maidens has deep blue, long-lashed, painted eyes and draping tresses of faded black hair; the other is more weathered, with only some peeling red paint where her locks used to be.  Upon the makeshift altar, bundles of herbs lend a fragrant air and rounded, glossy black stones surround candles set within bone-inset holders."
