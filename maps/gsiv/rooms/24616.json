    "With the scent of sweet hyacinth lingering in the air, this area is awash in vibrant emerald silks from the pavilion walls to the ceiling.  Underfoot, a thick carpet of velvet has been placed, its hue a muted golden interspersed with threads of green and blue.  A series of glass-enclosed lamps hang from the support beams above, their rippled shades fracturing the candlelight within to cast an array of illumination across the carpet and walls."
