    "An immense statue stands before you towering hundreds of feet high, giving you an excellent view of its ankle.  The statue has a large, muscular frame, and is resting his hands on the pommel of a two-handed sword.  As you look up the statue's length, you realize it has one fatal flaw--it is headless."
