    "Lit by a lamp burning with cold viridian flame, a desk of black widowwood rests along the curved chamber wall, topped with tiered boxes of carved bone that hold tidy sheaves of neatly inked paper.  The characteristic fragrance of the widowwood is a muted, distant thing, chased away by the bitter acridity of preservatives hanging heavy on the air."
