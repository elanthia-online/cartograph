    "The rows of turnips wind about the landscape, avoiding large rocks and finding the best patches of soil.  To the west, a long, deep culvert defines the western end of the turnip patch.  The culvert carries a slight bit of water southward, keeping the turnip patch well drained so that the turnip roots do not become soggy and rotten.  Thus it can rain often in the area, but the porous soil and the flanking culvert keep the soil moisture at a level conducive to growing turnips."
