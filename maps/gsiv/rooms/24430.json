    "Crystallized trails of water line the natural stone walls of the ingress.  Placed on either side of the barrier are a series of carved runes paired with rhimar sigils.  A shallow trough runs the length of the walls, cracked and barren of fluids.  Carved black marble stones create a curving path heading north, alternating with white marble inlays."
