  "description": [
    "Small, but cozy, this modest cabin offers little in the way of comfortable home amenities.  A small window rests above a neatly made bed, and a claw-footed dresser fits snugly against the wall beneath a teak-framed portrait.  Thin streamers of yellow silk have been hung from the ceiling in an obvious attempt to add some colorful decor to this otherwise crude dwelling."
