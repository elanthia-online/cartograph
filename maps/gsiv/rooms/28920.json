  "description": [
    "Perched above the line of encroaching mud and surrounded by blue-green monkeygrass, an oak boarding house is built within the curve of the high timber fence.  Bright white shutters frame its rainbow glaes windows beneath a shingled roof of cedar and mahogany slats, while a bright blue door stands open and inviting on its first story.  An enticing aroma of fresh baked bread vies for dominance over the dampness and other earthy scents that fill the air."
