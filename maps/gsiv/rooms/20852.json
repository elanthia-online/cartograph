    "Oil lamps at the four corners illuminate the bathing chamber with a warm light.  Soft rugs cover the floor, keeping the obsidian dry and safe to walk on despite any water splashed from the huge bathtub.  Towels, soaps and scented oils sit in convenient spots about the room, ready for use by any bathers."
