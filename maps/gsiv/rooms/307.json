    "A somber shop by the side of the road attracts a picturesque clientele.  Lissome travellers cloaked in forest green and hunters of many shapes and sizes gather outside.  Some have quivers slung across their backs, others hold menacing-looking contraptions of wood, metal and fiber.  A rugged wooden plaque in the shape of an arrow is nailed to the shop door."
