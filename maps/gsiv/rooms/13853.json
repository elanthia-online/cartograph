    "The chamber's ceiling is high above, lost in shadows from which hang ropes and chains like vines drooping below a thick forest canopy.  Across the eastern wall sits a low workbench, its top overlaid with golden oak.  The wall above the bench is covered with tools, and around each one a silhouette is carved, marking its place.  Even the pegs on which the implements rest are fashioned seamlessly of granite, implying that the whole face of the wall was hewn away, leaving the small pegs extending."
