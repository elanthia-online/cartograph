    "The path, if it could even be called that, plunges down a hillside into the dense forest below.  Barely discernible traces of passage also lead off to the south, following a ridgeline that drops steeply on the eastern side of the forest.  The footing in both directions appears tricky, but it also looks much easier to navigate than plunging directly into several feet of powdery snow underneath the trees to the north and west."
