    "Cobalt blue and buttercup yellow tiles mingle upon the round floor to create a sunburst mosaic that is outlined in grey mortar.  Directly opposite the entry is a circular golden linden staircase that disappears into a white stucco ceiling, which is hung with several hemp nets housing blown glass orbs.  An alternating pattern of open windows and oak-framed arches finishes the foyer.  One such arch leads to a small offset room."
