  "description": [
    "A grey and moist sea of mist envelops the crag, making it quite impossible to see more than an arm's length or two.  The moist air makes the small, granite mountain top slick and treacherous, but also adds a vibrancy to the blue-grey hued rock.  Occasional icy blasts of wind make the mist swirl hypnotically."
