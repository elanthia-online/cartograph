  "description": [
    "Set off slightly from the rest of the camp in a quiet place, a large, faded green tent sheds a bit of shade.  Sitting in its shadow is perhaps the oldest giantman you have ever seen.  The years and elements have wrinkled and tanned his skin like shrunken leather, and his shaman's braids are thinned with age.  His brown eyes have filmed over, leaving him without vision, but the strong guard standing beside him sees to it that no harm can come to him."
