  "description": [
    "Sunlight dapples the avenue as it stretches away from the open-air market towards the eastern edges of town.  Clapboard bungalows with thatched rooves are surrounded by wild thistle and scraggly beach grasses that sway in the persistent seaborne breeze.  A tall signpost dangling a pristine white sign sits at the top of a pathway lined with wild blueberry bushes that leads to a small single-story building."
