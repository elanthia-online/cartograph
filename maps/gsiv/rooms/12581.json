  "description": [
    "After branching off from the granite formation to the east, the trail dead ends at a shadowy stand of palms.  The trees are densely planted, with immense, spiked fronds that do as much to block further travel as the boles.  A thick growth of jungle undergrowth crowds at the foot of the palms, betraying the presence of fertile earth nestled in a pocket of the lava rock.",
