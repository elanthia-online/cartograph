    "The sounds of the outside world are but a din within this dark and quiet tent.  A candelabra thick with days of wax drippings casts its flickering light on an imposing iron rack and a low iron table, both laden with arm and leg greaves.  Atop a small leather-topped pedestal, a tastefully scripted note invites your attention."
