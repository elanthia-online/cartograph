  "description": [
    "A dramatic room of dark burgundy bourde with golden accents, the parlour conveys a measure of classical Faendryl elegance contrasting with its idiosyncratic accents.  Centered across from the circular hallway is a sharply chiseled obsidian fireplace, its hearth formed of shallow steps leading to a distorted rift within.  Plush, heavy drapes nearly conceal the old iron bars across the moonlit arched windows of the room, while just above the fireplace hangs an odd oil painting.  Matching claw-footed bourde armchairs and a glass table are centered in the room.",
