    "In this corner of the town's center, a stately building stands, longer than it is tall.  Wooden supports line the edge of the porch, upholding the overhang, which is trimmed in scalloped woodwork.  The panes of glass in the windows are whorled, obscuring the view of the building's interior, though a carved sign hangs above the doorway, while another smaller note dangles from the door handle on a bright green ribbon."
