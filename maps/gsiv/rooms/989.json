Then, in the next gust, the clouds are driven away and the moon shines down brightly on the path, creating blinding reflections off the ice and, in its own way, making the path once again difficult to traverse.  It is hard to decide which is preferable, clouds or moonlight.  The wind makes its own decisions, however.",
