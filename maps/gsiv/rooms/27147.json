    "Burnished copper poles support the wide, overlapping swathes of vibrant marine-hued silk gauze that form this airy pavillion.  Near the center of the open space is a mother-of-pearl inlaid dark green faenor table with elegantly scrolled legs on a pale golden oak parquet floor.  Standing some distance away from the walls of lapis, turquoise, and celadon silk, an ornately carved teak screen effectively sections a portion of the space into another room."
