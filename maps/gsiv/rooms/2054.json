  "description": [
    "A strong river surges down from the southern mountain and away northeast toward the sea.  Across its width are strung a hundred sturdy ropes, intertwined through pulleys, anchored at both ends, and supporting an almost fluid wooden tunnel that bobs above the water as though likely to fall at any moment.  But the carved runes of countless dwarven craftsmen mark the entrance to the suspension bridge, and it is unlikely to fall before you grow old and grey."
