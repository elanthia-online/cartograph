    "In the midst of the town stretches the main bazaar, spread out over rough and bumpy stones.  The serpentine lanes are abuzz with activity, from ghouls pushing carts of rocks through the street, to zombie soldiers performing their latest drill.  Disembodied eyes, all having red pupils, float through the area, scanning the surroundings as blood drips from their fleshy veins."
