    "Muted lamplight reflects off the intricate network of wires running along the top of the wagon, suspending a mess of tin cans, greasy gears, and stale laundry.  Massive red arrows are painted on the east wall, all pointing at some uneven metal shelves tied with frumpy yellow ribbons.  In one dusty corner, a rusty metal contraption sits behind broken hat rack.  Piled up on the floor, stacks of boxes teeter precariously, occluding a direct path between the entrance and a stained patchwork curtain.",
