  "description": [
    "Reaching over the tufted grass clearing, an enormous banyan tree looms over a sleepy tortoise.  Centered in the surrounding vegetation, the banyan tree's roots bow outwards creating a barely noticeable dark hollow.  Reflecting the muted moonlight, bleached bones stand out against the darkened shadows in the clearing.  Highlighted by a stray moonbeam, a single fiery red lily rises up from the pile of bones."
