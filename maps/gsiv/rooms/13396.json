    "A delicate silver chandelier emanates a soft, amber-hued light that flickers across the polished ebonwood floor in rippling waves.  A few gold-tasseled rugs mark the path to an expansive mahogany bar, its rounded edges chased with feathery patterns of silver intertwined with accents of opalescent vaalin.  Curved couches formed into a deep crescent shape are grouped around several tables, their seats lush and soft."
