    "The trail along the top of the cliff ends abruptly here, blocked by a large wall of broken rocks which jut up from the ground at unusual angles.  A small path leads around the rocks right at the rim of the chasm, but it seems dangerously narrow considering its proximity to the sheer drop into the gorge."
