    "Several thick leather chairs are arranged in the corner around a small wooden table.  Although currently unoccupied, the presence of several half-empty glasses of wine indicates that the area was only recently vacated.  The inner wall of the corridor is replaced to the south by a wrought iron railing that seems to look down into an open garden of some sort.",
    "Several thick leather chairs are arranged in the corner around a small wooden table.  The rich smell of the leather reaches you on a cool breeze from the south, where the corridor appears to be open to the outside somehow."
