    "Tiny rocky debris has been swept to the side into accumulated piles.  Constant foot traffic has smoothed the floor, revealing glimmering specks of mica and quartz in the stone.  A faint, yet not unpleasant, fungal aroma hangs in the air, mingled slightly with the fragrance of hearty dwarven ale."
