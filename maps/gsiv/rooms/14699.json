  "description": [
    "Beyond the top of the bluff, another flat, stone plateau surrounds geyser holes and vivid blue pools of water.  Steam rises from some of the reservoirs, marking the location of hot springs.  The stone underfoot is stained with bright bands of color, dyed by the constant barrage of minerals carried in the clouds of condensation, drifting across the vista like an indistinct herd of ghostly behemoths.",
