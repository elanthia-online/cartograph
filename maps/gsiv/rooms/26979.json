  "description": [
    "Cold air from the southwest clashes with warm air from the southeast, the combination filling the lush garden with an odd mixture of mist that is enhanced by the travertine steam vents that rise in a curtain along the northern edges.  Verdant mistweed forms a bright groundcover, while pot-bellied pitcher plants and spotted cobra lilies encircle a series of glowing mineral pools that cascade down the garden's high slopes.  The humid air is alive with small and large jewel-toned insects, their zipping bodies and rapidly moving wings filling the air with a soft buzz."
