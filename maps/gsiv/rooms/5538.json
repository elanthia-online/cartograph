    "A bed of overgrown rosebushes wraps around the house's northeast corner, lending the area a bright touch with a mix of red, pink and white blossoms.  Whatever bedding plants may have shared the space with the rosebushes have not survived, crowded out by the weeds that have taken over most of the manor yard."
