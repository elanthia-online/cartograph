    "This room is a shambles.  Benches and other furniture that would be antiques if they were in one piece are smashed and splintered, their pieces strewn all over the room in a chaotic explosion.  A few rusty swords, and a shield rim like a great iron hoop protrude from the junk.  Most of the wood is blackened, and a great charred table lies upended against one wall."
