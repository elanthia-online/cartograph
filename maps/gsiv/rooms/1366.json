    "The time-rounded stumps of stone columns stand at regular intervals in an expanse of black water, perhaps once a reflecting pool and bordering colonnade.  With the water's rise the remains of the columns now stand within the pool, and marsh grasses mark the boundaries of the surrounding stonework."
