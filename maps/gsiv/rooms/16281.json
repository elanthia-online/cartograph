    "Tendrils of ivy creep into the room through the wrapped bamboo walls and stretch from floor to ceiling.  Hanging from the ivy are several small buckets that carry miniscule amounts of water that most likely drip from the ceiling when it rains.  Along the western wall are several overturned crates and barrels holding various items of importance."
