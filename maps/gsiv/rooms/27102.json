  "description": [
    "A large stand of tree ferns occupies the northwest corner of the area, its tree-like trunk extending far into the canopy to push the massive fern leaves through the overlaying mist of the jungle.  In contrast, the clusters of ferns growing closer to the wilderness floor flourish in the dappled light admitted between the capirona trees inhabiting the wilds.  The thick stems of twisting, braided liana vines mingle with the plant life, strikingly similar to small tree trunks in girth."
