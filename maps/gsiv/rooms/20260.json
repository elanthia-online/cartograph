  "description": [
    "A broad, flat piece of ground has been wrestled here from the surrounding vegetative incursion.  Well-tended and planted with a border of colorful flowers, there is room here for many to gather on red and white benches.  Vendors have taken advantage of the open space with the placement of small booths and kiosks, and the aromas of baked goods perfume the humid air."
