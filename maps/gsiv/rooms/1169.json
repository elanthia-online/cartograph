    "A large, flat rock sticks out at an angle in the middle of the river, diverting the waters around it.  A large weeping willow has grown out of a crevice in the rock, forcing its roots down through the stone and somehow finding enough nourishment to keep itself alive even with all the water around it.  The tree leans toward the south, bowing to the buffeting of the winds, and the tips of its long, leaf-covered branches trail in the river's water."
