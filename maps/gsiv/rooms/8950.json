    "The peculiar halfling naval architecture is evident throughout the alley, the entire neighborhood of bungalows and cottages having a seagoing air about them.  Many of the citizens and inhabitants have settled down in Icemule Trace to start a quieter life and get away from their bloodthirsty (or tartstealing) pasts."
