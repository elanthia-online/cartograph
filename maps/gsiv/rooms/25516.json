    "Huge bronze cannons glare brightly from embrasures in the crennelated railing surrounding the sterncastle, guarding the rear of the ship like dogs on the watch.  A wheel embellished with gold and crimson lacquer stands at the center of the deck, carved of the same greyish fireleaf as most of the deck plankings, but polished to a glassy smoothness by the touch of many hands.  The raised deck provides an unobstructed view all the way to the bow of the ship."
