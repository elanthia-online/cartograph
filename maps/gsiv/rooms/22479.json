    "This small but cozy wagon is infused with the scent of fresh paint.  From the base of one wall, across the ceiling, and then down the opposite wall, a grand rainbow has been painted in bright iridescent hues, creating a vivid arc of colors.  A silver-capped rack showcases a wide selection of shirts and dresses, and an ornate oak trunk displays a variety of leg wear.  Precisely cut multicolored square cubes fill a silk-wrapped case that has a lid propped open with a gnome-sized broom."
