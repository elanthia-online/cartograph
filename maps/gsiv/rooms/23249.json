    "The smooth surface of the round table contrasts with the detailed, filigreed carvings along its circumference.  A depression in the table's center is filled with wax and supports several thick black wicks arranged in a circle.  A small marble sound block rests on the table, near one of the surrounding modwir chairs, and a quill, inkwell, and sheaf of parchment are placed in front of another.  Under the table are some short three-legged stools and a large modwir case."
