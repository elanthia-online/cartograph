  "description": [
    "Large boulders create a protective barrier around a pristine cove surrounded by white sands.  Slender pathways along the beach twine their way through the verdant canopy, where a small structure can be glimpsed amid the leaves.  Sufficiently blocking passage into the bay, the round rocks take the brunt of the choppy waters."
