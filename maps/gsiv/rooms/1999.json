  "description": [
    "The wood is easily passable despite thick vines and lush undergrowth.  Still, the natural buttresses of the mistwood roots impart the sensation of a rat's maze.  No sooner is the end of one natural wall reached, than another from a neighboring tree turns the path back upon itself."
