    "The room is constructed of local maoral, washing its walls and floor in rich, dark red hues.  Thick pillars crafted from the trunks of living trees span the length of the hall from entry to dais, their looming forms standing guard to the tapestries hung between them, their leafy tops unseen, above the level of the thatched ceiling.  Piercing the gloom, a gilt-framed oculus directly above the dais casts a baleful eye of moonlight on a massive mahogany altar set upon it.  Several doorways lead to different rooms in the temple complex.",
