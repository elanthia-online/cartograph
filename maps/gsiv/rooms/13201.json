    "The antechamber is a circular room open on one side to the courtyard, allowing the sunlight and scents of flowers to stream in.  Grand arched doorways positioned at two points on its curve, and a teak bench sits opposite the open side.  Overhead, the ceiling is high and domed, and a large chandelier hangs from the apex, fitted with hundreds of candles.",
