    "The dining room is grand and spacious.  A huge, round, ebony table fills the center of the room.  Many comfortable chairs surround the table.  Beautiful tapestries adorn the marble walls on all sides of the room.  An elaborate chandelier hangs regally over the center table.  The light from torches in the corners of the room dance off the chandelier, making the room sparkle brilliantly."
