    "A long bamboo counter covered with neatly stacked piles of deeds stretches across the back wall.  Pictures of island properties hang above the desk in a nice straight row along the wall.  Baskets of fresh cut island flowers adorn the few tables where a couple of buyers skim through books on the local environs."
