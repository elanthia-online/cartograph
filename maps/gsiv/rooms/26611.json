    "The small rivulets of water leading from the hole join dozens of thin streams in a steep drop-off, the area barely lit by a single torch flickering with gusts of cold wind.  Across the spray-enshrouded divide is a wood-planked pier, its supports slowly swaying as the water beneath it flows into the blackness below."
