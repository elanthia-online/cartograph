    "Enticing, savory aromas drift through a set of steel-braced double doors flanked by potted, luminescent toadstools.  Stacked nearby are several crates and boxes filled with recent food deliveries that have yet to be unpacked.  Cook's assistants occasionally wander by, carrying trays of food to other areas."
