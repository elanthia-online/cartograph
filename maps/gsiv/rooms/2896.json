    "The mountains sag above, forming a curved bowl framed within the thrusting peaks at its sides.  All but a few jagged outcroppings lie buried under a soft blanket of white powder.  Spiraling overhead, tendrils of blowing snow sweep upwards over the concave slope.  The dancing wisps of winter's smoke eventually fade into nothingness against the sky."
