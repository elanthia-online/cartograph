    "The sepia-veined green marble floor is dominated by a carved ebonwood sculpture in the center.  Hanging in evenly spaced intervals on the two pine green walls are an old tattooed animal pelt, an oak-framed oil painting, and a gold-framed forest painting.  Flickering brass oil lanterns dot the walls between the artwork, casting their light on the room."
