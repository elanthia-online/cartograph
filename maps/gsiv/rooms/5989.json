    "Fan-like grape leaves and yellow-tipped grasses quiver slightly in the light breeze, their motion sending a dry crackling chatter across the field.  To the east lie gently rolling hills covered in velvety grass, their summits capped by a few sparse oak trees.  The quickly moving shadow of a black raven darts across the ground, as its living counterpart crosses the pallid sky, its gaze aimed downward in search of easy prey."
