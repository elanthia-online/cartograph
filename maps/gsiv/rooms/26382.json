  "description": [
    "The first thing you notice about this room is a massive stone fireplace that fills most of the northern wall.  A long \"L\" shaped bookcase sits against the opposite wall surrounding a large stuffed chair.  In the center of the room, covered by thick sleeping furs, is a heavy mahogany bed with gleaming brass bedknobs on all four corners."
