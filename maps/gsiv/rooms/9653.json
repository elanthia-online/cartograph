    "Two elderly dwarven ladies sit in rocking chairs on the front porch of one of the tidy homes of Zhindel's Post.  They smile and wave at passers by while chatting quietly.  A few scattered businesses mingle with a like number of houses on this road.  The area is surprisingly free of trash or unsightly elements, and no stray animals roam the streets.  Occasionally a full cart pulled by several dwarven men rumbles past, headed into the forest to the north or an empty one comes past the other direction.",
    "Two elderly dwarven gentlemen sit by lantern light, playing chess on the front porch of one of the tidy homes of Zhindel's Post.  The bowls of their pipes glow as they puff away, apparently too absorbed in their game to notice anyone passing by.  A few scattered businesses mingle with a like number of houses on this road.  The area is surprisingly free of trash or unsightly elements, and no stray animals roam the streets."
