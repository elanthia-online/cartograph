  "description": [
    "Sturdy candle-filled lanterns hang from the ceiling, casting a faint glow throughout the wagon.  A bowl of half-eaten stew rests on a small end table and emits an unpleasant aroma that offers insight to its continued existence.  Dark green ivy has been twined with long honeysuckle branches, the decorative union deliberately threaded and wrapped around the slats of two wooden benches."
