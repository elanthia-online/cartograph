  "description": [
    "The Turn is composed of a circular road ringed on its perimeter with neat houses.  A small median sits within the circle's embrace with a large rock positioned in its center.  The top of the rock is mantled with snow, and a few halfling children climb nimbly through large craters in the stone, their laughter and calls echoing off the faces of the buildings watching their play.",
