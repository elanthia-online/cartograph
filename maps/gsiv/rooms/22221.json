    "The twinkling of countless shattered gems brightens the floor of this enchanting open air gazebo.  Simple low benches provide plenty of comfortable seating but do not detract from the view of the courtyard through the large open arches around them.  The domed ceiling, decorated with a large fresco, sparkles with inset gems in the moonlight."
