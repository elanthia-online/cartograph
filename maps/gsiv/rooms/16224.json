  "description": [
    "The 'Way' is a narrow alley-like thoroughfare which winds through rows of houses like a snake.  It is paved in an attractive type of paving stones.  Their color is a sienna so rich, it is reminiscent of a crimson moon rising out of the thick atmosphere at sunset.  The smell of sandalwood is strong, drifting from a row of spice shops interspersed between the residences."
