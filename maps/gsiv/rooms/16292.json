    "The tunnel branches, its divergence marked by a stone bench set between a group of round doors.  Carved stone flowers cluster around the legs of the settle, each petal perfectly rendered.  The lanterns overhead evolve from angularity to an ornate spiral, which marks the row of lamps marching along the ceiling to the southwest."
