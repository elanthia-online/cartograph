  "description": [
    "Drying herbs hang from long, thin poles stretched across the ceiling of the infirmary, while several shelves along the wall offer up potions and tinctures of various size and type.  A basin of fresh water is placed at the head of a wide wooden bench that rests against the back wall of the room.  Fresh straw is spread across the earthen floor and tracked partly out the doorway into the courtyard outside.  Gaps in the straw reveal dark stains in the dirt floor."
