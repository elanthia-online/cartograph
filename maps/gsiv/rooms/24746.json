  "description": [
    "As you enter the room, the first thing that strikes you is the obvious femininity of the surroundings.  Beneath the lace-curtained windows rests a white wrought iron daybed.  On a small table next to the bed sits a lamp and a bowl of chocolates.  In the corner you see a vanity and mirror.  A polar bear rug stretches across the room to a white marble fireplace with an engraved gold plaque hanging over it.  Scattered throughout the room are many trinkets and mementos."
