  "description": [
    "The deep swamp has laid claim to a wagon, but only the badly stained canvas canopy is now showing above the soupy quagmire.  Why the owner would veer off the rugged path is anyone's guess, but four of the wooden slats of the road are missing, and several others are cracked in half.  A torch has been placed on what is left of the wagon, either as a memorial or perhaps as a warning."
