    "The very air seems alive as traces of static streak between the dark blue glaes lamps hanging from the ceiling.  A mottled marble worktable covered with wands and potions stands against one wall, next to a black willow podium bearing an ancient tome.  A safe distance from the work area, a grey suede divan and a soft black sable couch are arranged around a silver-threaded silk-tasseled rug.  Affixed to the wall above a silvery tray is an engraved electrum sign."
