  "description": [
    "A large, white-washed stucco hall is composed of a series of interconnected spaces separated by frosted crystal globes set upon ogee arches of exposed rough-hewn maoral, save for one with a colorful haon dart board.  The southern area contains a reading room, to the west is a curved maoral buffet near a kitchen, and to the east, a wall of artwork.  The center of the room features semi-circular wooden benches around a massive copper vent hood hanging above a stone fire pit.  A small door is set into the northeastern recess."
