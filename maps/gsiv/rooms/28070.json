    "Sturdy iron fixtures are placed throughout the space, giving a rugged feel to this spacious display room.  Spread across one section of flooring is a layer of clean straw bedding.  An iron-barred hay rack has been affixed to some rough-hewn wall planks, beside a sturdy hook dangling a rust-flaked iron feed pail.  A display table resting in the straw shows off the appearance of an iron-banded teak watering trough.  Prominently nailed near the entrance is a large parchment notice."
