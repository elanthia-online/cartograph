    "Several large tufts of meadow grass have been overturned in this area, their thin roots clinging to bits of soil as they lean helplessly to one side.  A dank musky odor lingers on the air, as if a large animal had recently passed through the region.  In the distance, the sound of something thrashing amongst the grass can be heard, but its exact location and origin remain lost in the dim light.",
