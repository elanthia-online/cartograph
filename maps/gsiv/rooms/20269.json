  "description": [
    "Tall and spindly trees rise from the spongy, leaf-strewn ground, stretching upward to blend into a wall of sickly brown.  The air is still and sticky, leaving a layer of moisture clinging to any exposed skin.  Several hillocks and mounds of brown dirt are visible in the nearby outer swamp."
