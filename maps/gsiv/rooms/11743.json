    "Rubble fills most of the cell from the collapse of the eastern wall of the room.  Light flickers in from outside the doorway, dimly reflected off the surfaces of chains and manacles still attached to the unaffected walls.  Piled near to the door are mounds of discarded clothes, most torn and shredded."
