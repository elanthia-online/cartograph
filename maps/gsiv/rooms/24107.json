    "Torches mounted along the eastern wall cast a dim light that barely touches the other side of the room.  A mummified corpse, clothed in full battle armor, reclines in an alcove set into the western wall.  Cobwebs and dust coat the fallen warrior, obscuring the crest on his breastplate.  His helmet is clasped at his side by one gauntleted hand."
