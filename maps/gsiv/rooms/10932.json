  "description": [
    "The Mews consists of a tall line of houses down each side of a narrow, but straight lane.  At each end, the avenue veers away, giving the straightaway an enclosed feeling of privacy.  Above some of the homes fly family crests woven on banners, and the stoops are maintained in scrupulous condition.  Small shrubbery planted in urns are placed intermittently down the block."
