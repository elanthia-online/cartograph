    "Constructed from black-painted timber, the smooth walls bear a series of hammers and chisels of varying sizes.  The floor is littered with offshoots of soft limestone and pieces of rock.  At the back of the hut, rough blocks of veined stone rest beside a large bin overflowing with well-worn masonry tools.  An expansive stone workbench stands in the center of the room, beside an overturned chest with a canvas cushion that serves to provide seating.  A rough-hewn oak door leads out.",
