    "Fine mists of snow drift down through the pine boughs overhead in a gentle shower, making the air sparkle with their iridescence.  The light is low and gentle, breaking through the needle canopy in stark rays that mottle the carpet of needles on the ground.  Only the wind can penetrate the heavy hush, caressing the silence with its lonely whisper.",
    "Fine mists of snow drift down through the pine boughs overhead in a gentle shower, making the air sparkle with their iridescence.  The light is low and gentle, breaking through the needle canopy in pale, thin rays that mottle the carpet of needles on the ground.  Only the wind can penetrate the heavy hush, caressing the silence with its lonely whisper."
