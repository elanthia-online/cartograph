    "Cutting across the meadow, a small brook runs near the path as it winds along.  The water gurgles merrily as it tumbles over smooth stones on its way to the nearby Mistydeep River.  A tarnished silver wind chime hang from the branches of a nearby guelder rosebush.  Leading away from the center of the meadow, a narrow path disappears into the tall grass."
