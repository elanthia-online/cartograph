    "A sea of tall, rich grass stretches away to the eastern horizon.  The golden ranges of pasture are mottled by what little moonlight is able to penetrate the fog emanating from the lake to the northwest.  A stormfront in the distant covers the skyline with low clouds.  The road branches, leading off into the verdant monochrome in three directions.",
    "A sea of tall, rich grass stretches away to the eastern horizon.  The golden ranges of pasture are mottled by what half-light is able to penetrate the fog emanating from the lake to the northwest.  A stormfront in the distant covers the skyline with low clouds, their undersides painted a brilliant gold by reflection from the gilded plains below.  The road branches, leading off into the verdant monochrome in three directions."
