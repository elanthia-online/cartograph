  "description": [
    "Polished oak tables of honey-hued oak span the length and breadth of the hall, flanked by solid benches cushioned by simple crimson upholstery.  Bright vermilion banners graced by raptors of golden embroidery flourish from either side of the vaulted ceiling, from which is suspended a cluster of brass chandeliers.  One end of the hall is occupied by a raised table clad in fire-hued cloth.  At the other, a recessed door leads into the kitchens."
