  "description": [
    "The corridor makes a dogleg turn here, leaving a somewhat cleared area in the corner.  While most of the crates in this area seem to be of normal quality, a few open and empty ones seem to be made of much nicer material.  An almost empty ale barrel drips slowly onto the ground with a *PLOP* and gives the area a decidedly sour odor.  Several pirates bustle around a lacquered black armor rack and a sturdy shield stand set up near the bulkhead."
