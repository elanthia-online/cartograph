    "Frothy pale yellow curtains frame the glaesine windows, each one hung with glittering pieces of stained glaes art that refracts the sunlight across the room.  A long glaes-topped counter lines two walls, stuffed with decadent treats neatly displayed on lacy white doilies.  The air is filled with the sweet scent of chocolate."
