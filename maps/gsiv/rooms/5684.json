  "description": [
    "A massive onyx statue of a reclining feline dominates the entire room, its huge jaws open in a yawn revealing curved ivory teeth.  The dark panther is stretched out languidly before you, its front paws reaching along both sides of the room in a lazy embrace, claws extended.  A simple altar draped with deep red silk is set before the cat's unblinking, intensely focused gaze, an open book lying upon its surface."
