  "description": [
    "A set of steps leads down from a pair of glass double doors, culminating at a cobblestone path that winds through this lush garden of flowers that bloom in every shade possible.  Twin topiaries shaped like wyverns flank the entrance to a section dedicated to roses, one trellis leaning up against the villa to display a variety of blossoms.  The sweet scent of flowers fills the air, and a thin layer of petals carpets the grass.  Centrally located at the end of the path, a circular reflecting pool mirrors the blooms surrounding it."
