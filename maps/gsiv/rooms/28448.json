    "The high ceilings of this small room give the false impression of spaciousness.  Various shields, each sporting a completely different coat of arms, are displayed proudly over every wall.  Mismatched flags hanging from short, jutting poles are interspersed randomly among the shields.  Standing torches brightly light the room, and the air is heavy with the rich scent of chocolate."
