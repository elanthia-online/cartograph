    "Massive stones, pale grey in color, and fitted together so well that the joins are nearly invisible, rest at the top of a brush covered hill.  Blaestonberry cling heartily to the tower-flanked gates with a vaulted archway in the center of the stone wall.  Vines struggle in vain to reach the pointed domes of the towers, which appear to be made of polished silver in the moonlight.  Running along one side of the wall rising up here is a narrow path traversing down into a deep gorge.",
    "Massive stones, pale grey in color, and fitted together so well that the joins are nearly invisible, rest at the top of a low hill.  Blaestonberry cling heartily to the tower-flanked gates with a vaulted archway in the center of the stone wall.  Sunlight glitters on the pointed domes of the towers, making it appear as if the domes themselves are made of burnished gold.  Running along one side of the wall rising up here is a narrow path traversing down into a deep gorge."
