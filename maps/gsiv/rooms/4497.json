    "This cave would be completely engulfed in darkness were it not for the use of three half-lit lanterns.  One lantern sits close to the cave's entrance, its light falling onto an open wooden strongbox.  Two lanterns sit at the far side of the cave, their light splashing on a pair of glass display cases.  A wooden weapons rack has been propped up against one of the display cases, while an open chest has been pushed against the other."
