    "Climbing the hill in a gentle spiral, the lane passes a terrace ornamented with a host of sculpture and marble columns.  Large sienna-toned tiles form a stage for the handsome host, and huge terra-cotta pots hold ornamental shrubs and flowers.  Residences ring the piazza, their facades as genteel as the terrace they border.",
