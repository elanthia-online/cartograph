    "To one side of the wedding glade, a large tent of dark velvet has been erected.  You stand near the entrance flap through which you can see a large open space set aside for the evening's dancing and festivities.  From time to time, happy couples flushed from dancing and the warmth of the interior come out to cool themselves or to seek a quieter spot for a moment's kiss."
