    "A sculpted walkway of crushed white shells forms a gently curving path through the lush foliage.  Fragrant blooms of anthurium encroach along the edges, and blooming patches of dog roses trail off into the surrounding darkness.  Twisting rattan vines drape gracefully overhead, effectively blocking even the briefest glimpse of moonlight.  To the north the illuminated outline of a large estate rises from the hillside, and to the south a sturdy dock provides access to the waterway."
