    "Bits of seaweed, clusters of black coral, and a few barnacles litter the ground inside the tent.  A rack is placed to one side of the tent, while a long table is set up in the center with some items for sale.  A large crate and a carved wooden box are near a flap that leads to another section of the merchant's tent."
