    "Large elderberry brambles cluster around the tall fel trees that top this ridge.  The enormous fels loom above the valley, standing silent guard over the valley's lush vegetation.  The harsh buzz of wyvernflies nesting in the brambles distracts you as one streaks off in the direction of a patch of wildflowers down in the valley."
