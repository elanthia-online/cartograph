    "One flameless lantern hangs from the overhead, dousing the compartment in flickering blue light.  The planks underfoot have been painted a deep cerulean and are adorned with silver runic, though the patterns of the lettering appear totally random.  Along one wall is a spindly black rack made from polished ebony.  Sitting across it, a single glaesine bowl glistens and dances in the uncertain light."
