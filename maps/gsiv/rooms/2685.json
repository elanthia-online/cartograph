    "The full fury of the winter wind hurls needle-sharp spicules of ice against the mountain, shearing the rock of any gentle drifts of snow here on an exposed ledge.  As if retreating from the onslaught, the trail doglegs, descending to the south and climbing up the slopes in a southeast direction."
