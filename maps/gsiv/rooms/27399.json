    "The sky above is dark, and while a few stars are visible through the treetops, they are unfamiliar to the eye, and do little to light the path.  Large torches have been erected in the center of the travelway, interspersed in such a way that they provide some light, but not enough to be sure of the footing below.  The combination of the guttering torches and dim ambient light casts strange shadows to each side.",
    "Filled with thick, low clouds, the sky does little to light the path through the trees.  Large torches have been erected in the center of the travelway, their guttering flames casting strange shadows to each side."
