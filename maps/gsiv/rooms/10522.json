    "Groves of dead trees occupy a fair-sized nearby reef, their branches swaying briskly back and forth, though there is no perceptible wind.  The soil, from which the trees managed to thrive even though for a short time, is of a loose powdery consistency.  A nest is perched precariously on a lone, lifeless bush, its roots protruding from the soil.  Though none are in plain sight from here, the sad crying song of the limpkin can be heard at intermittent periods."
