    "The low ceiling is covered with a detailed painting of a nymphish young woman clad in draping seaweed, a bright smile upon her face as she rises up amid the large waves.  A border of pink clam shells are inset upon the sides of the table, some a bit more chipped than others.  Dark blue velvet provides a comfortable seating in the cozy little booth, though a few stains are visible upon its soft surface."
