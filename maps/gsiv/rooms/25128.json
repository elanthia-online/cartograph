    "A row of leather sofas sit opposite some plush divans, both stacked high with an obscene amount of decorative silk pillows.  High overhead, the ceiling is replaced with a stained glass image depicting an assemblage of stars and planets.  Wisps of ethereal energy travel along the rim of a carved marble fountain stationed in the center of the lounge."
