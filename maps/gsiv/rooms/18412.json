    "Sections of split-rail fence create an enclosure with openings that lead to the very heart of the town.  Each post of the fence bears a flowered wreath, and greenery strewn with full and half-open blossoms is draped along the railings.  Here and there, tall poles tower above, supporting banners that move with even the most subtle of winds."
