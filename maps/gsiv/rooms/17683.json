    "As the tunnel continues to the northwest, it begins to widen considerable, while doing the opposite to the south.  A metal hatch is set into the side of the tunnel's north wall, and two torches flicker in sconces placed to either side of the hatch.  Reflecting the uneven torchlight is a metal object set into the wall adjacent to the hatch.  On the opposite wall hangs the skeleton of a krolvin, pinned to the wall by a large pike."
