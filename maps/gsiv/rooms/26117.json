  "description": [
    "Flanked by dark blue swags, a set of massive, steel-banded blackwood doors are thrown open, the inpouring moonlight catching golden flecks in the grey-black floor and striking a path across the tremendous foyer to some stone steps.  A dizzying spiral of colorful doors lining the steep ascension of the narrow staircase along the curved walls disappears out of sight in the ozone-scented darkness overhead."
