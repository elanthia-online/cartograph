    "Grass and other types of weeds grow in between some of the cracks that have formed in the cobblestones over the years.  Along the side of the road a huge boulder that strongly resembles a frog lies at the edge of a thorn bush.   Beautiful assortments of various wild flowers are in full bloom their fragrance filling the air."
