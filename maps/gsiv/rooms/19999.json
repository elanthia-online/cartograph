    "The tunnel roof slopes down toward the south, hampering movement in that direction.  Just about eye level there is a horizontal crevice running for about three feet, and at its widest point is about six inches high.  A scrabbling sound can be heard from inside it, and sand and small stones are gently propelled out, falling to the floor. Looking down, you see the bones of a small creature of some sort."
