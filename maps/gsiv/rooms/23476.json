    "Pieces of various fabrics, hides, and adornments litter the planked walls of the room, the squares haphazardly grouped together with scrawled notes and bits of hempen rope.  A pale mint enamel-framed board leans against the left wall, the bottom buried beneath crumpled balls of parchment and vellum.  The right wall is hung with a silver-cast rack, the pole hung with a multitude of colorful bodices and corsetry.  A seashell-inlaid mirror dominates the back of workshop, draped in piles of half-sewn garments."
