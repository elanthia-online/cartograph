  "description": [
    "The gentle scent of smoke wafts through the air as wisps dance above smoldering coals within wrought iron braziers.  A pathway, faintly painted spots of blue interspersed with white porcelain tiles, serves as a guide toward a small alcove.  From within channels carved into the floor along the edge of the hallway, the sound of water can be heard as thin streams trickle in through a driftwood arch."
