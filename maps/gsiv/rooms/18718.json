  "description": [
    "This open, airy room has a smooth, polished floor that is covered by thick mats at the north end.  A large oak storage chest and a bramble-carved ironwood bench rest beneath the windows in the western wall, framing the doorway.  Wrought iron sconces supporting unlit oil lamps are set into the walls around the room.  Matching suits of armor are displayed on the east wall, and an ironwood rack holding a bow, a sword, and a shield hangs on the south wall.  Practice dummies stand in a row at the south end of the room."
