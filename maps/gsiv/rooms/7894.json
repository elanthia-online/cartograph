    "The trees part to form a pocket opening on the hill just above the grove.  Underbrush creeps into the path fullfilling nature's effort to erase the presense of past visitors.  Situated at the edge of the overlook is a large grey pedestal with a massive lens mounted on it.  A tall steel lever protrudes from the pedestal to the left of the lens, and a short grey mithril crank rises up on its right."
