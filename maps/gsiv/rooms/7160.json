    "You are standing on the north bank of a fast moving stream that has cut a deep gully through this part of the forest.  A dense growth of thick underbrush surrounds you, the leaves of which sparkle with tiny drops of water that have been cast into the air by the rushing water.  A tremendous elm tree has been felled and placed across the gully and appears to provide you with a way to bridge the chasm."
