    "Beneath an uneven wooden ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  A plain wooden table sits in one corner while a worn rug rests on the wooden floor.",
    "Tufted velveteen walls rise from a dark mahogany floor.  Just above a serene golden wyvern fountain hangs a tattered merchant permit, and an uneven wooden ceiling completes the picture.  An intricately carved ebonwood stand and a plain wooden table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
