    "Set within a small alcove off the main hall, the shop is well-lit and cozy in design.  A variety of cases and trunks lay behind several glass-topped counters, the warding runes upon their bindings glowing softly whenever a shadow crosses over them.  Accented with touches of lustrous silver and pale sapphire, the shop has a quietly elegant sense of style."
