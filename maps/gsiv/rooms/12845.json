  "description": [
    "Dark iron racks are set against the walls, numerous garments hung from their hooks.  Open chests lie next to them, and a thick coating of dust coats just about everything, the tiny motes dancing about erratically in the faint illumination.  The planks of the floor are cracked and weathered, groaning with a long, drawn-out creaking sound with every footfall."
