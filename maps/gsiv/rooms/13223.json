  "description": [
    "The hallway opens into a circular chamber, its vaulted ceiling spiraling into the darkness above.  Elongated lancet windows shed pale shafts of light across the contents of the room.  An unadorned low wooden altar appears to be the focal point of the chapel, its short rectangular surface bordered on each side by a rosewood stand bearing a white ceramic bowl.  The heavy odor of dying flowers fills the room, its sweet scent apparently rising from the twin bowls."
