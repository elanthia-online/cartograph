    "Cooks and apprentices dash around in a frenzy of activity, creating a tumultuous chorus with iron pots and pans, while scullery maids attend to the used cookware.  Steady shouts from one of the cooks punctuate the organized chaos, while assistants stoke the wood-burning stoves, and the wait staff gathers the final products of the frantic pace for delivery to the tavern."
