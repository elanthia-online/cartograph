    "Fringe on the tapestry hanging beside one of the two doors of this corridor flutters gently as a gust of air drifts in from a small vent in the wall.  In the background of the tapestry, black smoke rises from burning buildings while a grisly scene of trolls and krolvins working together overwhelm a small band of human warriors."
