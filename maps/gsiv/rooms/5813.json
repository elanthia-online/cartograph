  "description": [
    "The floor slopes sharply and the air carries a whiff of corruption that is stronger to the west.  The faint crunch of pebbles disturbed by your passage sounds as loud as a shout in the silent tunnels.  Sparse patches of lichen give off feeble light that barely delineates the position of the beams lining the walls."
