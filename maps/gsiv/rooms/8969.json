    "The lane ends in a cul-de-sac, its pristine curbs ringed with narrow residences.  Many of the polished doors on the houses are hung with wreaths of holly and ivy, and the roofs are composed of sienna-red tiles.  Clumps of snow rest on some of the eaves, the bright white making the crimson tiles look crisp and bright in contrast.  In the shelter of a couple of the eaves huddle a few pigeons, sending their soft song out into the enclave."
