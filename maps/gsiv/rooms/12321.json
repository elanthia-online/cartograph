    "Sturdy red cedar trellises are attached to the wall upon either side of double doors, their mahogany lattices laden with the thickly corded vines of morning glories.

    "Sturdy red cedar trellises are attached to the wall upon either side of double doors, their mahogany lattices laden with the thickly corded vines of moonflowers.  Heavy shadows lay across the path from the catwalk above, though several rays of silvery moonlight manage to sneak through the thick foliage to illuminate the crushed white seashells of the pathways as they meander towards other sections of the garden."
