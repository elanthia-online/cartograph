    "Marked by hard-stamped soil, a narrow trail snakes off in several directions through the dense thicket of hawthorn.  Thick, thorny branches reach out from every direction at once, with a clear intention to tear at clothing and skin.  As if in celebration of their success, wispy fibres of tattered cloth remain dangling from dark-stained thorns.  Littering the ground are dozens of crab apple cores."
