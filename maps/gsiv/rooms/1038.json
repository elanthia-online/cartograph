    "The trail continues steadily to the east and west.  A howling erupts from out on the moor somewhere, the mournful tones filling the air for a full minute before abruptly stopping.  To the south a thundering sound passes by as if many beasts of considerable size were rushing from east to west, and, as the noise recedes, the sound of something padding through the grasses approaches and stops.  Whatever it is remains concealed by the grass and fog.  It snorts twice, then retreats."
