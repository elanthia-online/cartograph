  "description": [
    "Dark wood paneling lines the walls of the foyer, offset by bright white porcelain plates affixed firmly to the wall by steel bracketing and lit by candle-filled lamps dangling overhead.  Standing against the wall opposite the open stained-glass hatch is a tufted brown leather couch, which is flanked on either side by low wooden endtables."
