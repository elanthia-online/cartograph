    "Rusted buckets are everywhere, probably the remnants of a futile effort to save this small cottage from the fire.  Although the fire barely touched this room, the subsequent exposure to the elements all but destroyed it.  Shattered dishes and broken pots are strewn around the room, as if left by some overgrown, petulant child."
