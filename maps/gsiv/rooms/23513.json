  "description": [
    "Spreading out in every direction, dark water sploshes violently up against the small wooden rowboat.  A pair of oars are stacked next to a small gangplank, which leads to a pile of slimy, wet rocks.  Perched on the edge of the boat, a bright red flag patterned with a furry-footed halfling flaps back-and-forth in the constant wind."
