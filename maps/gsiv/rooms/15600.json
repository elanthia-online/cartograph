    "Faust's domain is one of highly polished wood and shining hardware.  Rows of glasses reflect light and the luster of brass fittings.  Candles with beaded shades are placed intermittently down the length of the counter, which add to the mellow gleam.  Over the bar hangs a monumental painting of a scantily clad, reclining halfling."
