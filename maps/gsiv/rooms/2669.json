  "description": [
    "Although the octagonal chamber isn't small, the aisle through it is crowded and difficult to navigate.  The room's center is dominated by a large sculpture depicting a pile of treasure so lifelike, only the dull surface of the stone reveals it as a fabrication.  Piles of exactingly carved coins spread in all directions, punctuated with strands of pearls and all manner of jewelry and fanciful armor.  On its summit rests a drake, rendered in a lazy and contented repose."
