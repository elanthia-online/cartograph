    "The barley plants march east and west in a slow arc, keeping their spacing consistent.  When the rows encounter a rock too large to be removed, they merely stop and continue along on the other side of the rock.  Occasionally weeds insinuate themselves in between the barley plants, but for the most part the barley seems to hold its own, keeping out the unwanted interlopers and maintaining the purity of their ranks."
