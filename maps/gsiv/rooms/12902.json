    "Sturdy-looking wood and brick houses line the southern portion of the road, each adorned with its own fence and lantern post.  Sturdy posts support a flat roof over a small patch of grass riddled with worn walking tracks and surrounded by a variety of barrels in various stages of repair and decay."
