  "description": [
    "This small back area of the tent is home to a slender cot and a large ornate armoire.  The dresser's doors are opened slightly, revealing a small peek at a vast assortment of costumes and accessories within.  A small desk is positioned near the center of the alcove, a number of buttons, cloth bolts, and sewing needles scattered across its surface.  A shimmering gold silk curtain leads back to the front of the tent."
