  "description": [
    "Tufts of grass cling to the ragged track that follows the edges of a series of packed dirt ramps to the portside town below, while muddy pathways wend their way through a small logging colony that is built upon the cliff's edge.  Tapered logs form a sturdy barrier along the western expanses of the settled area, the sturdy defenses keeping the forested wilds at bay.  A perimeter of bamboo and hemp torches rises on the leeward side of a guardrail that stretches the length of the plunging precipice."
