  "description": [
    "This dimly lit tent is filled with carefully stacked piles of armor, clothing, and various other trinkets too numerous to mention.  A long table rests in the corner and behind it, an enruned veil which seems to be covering the back section of the tent, preventing any chance of seeing what lies beyond."
