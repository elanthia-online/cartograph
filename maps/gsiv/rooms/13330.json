    "The lane curves from a heavy canopy of trees to the west, and veers around the base of a tall hill to the east.  Gardens to either side offer a profusion of blooms that scent the air with a heady perfume.  Farther up the elevation, tall white columns and towering trees accent the hillside, alternating with gardens and terraced waterfalls, as well as beautiful villas and palazzos."
