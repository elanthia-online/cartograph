  "description": [
    "Large boulders cropping up from under the camouflage of wild vegetation give evidence of the rockiness of the terrain at this southern edge of the forest.  The most massive of the exposed stones sits beside the fallen trunk of an uprooted tree, which serves as a perfect spot to sit and look out over a dizzying drop at the southwestern point of the area.  Woody liana vines coil around the surrounding upright trees, and brown mushrooms cluster close to their buttressed roots."
