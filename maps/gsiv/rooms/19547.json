    "The smooth walls of the large mining cart, so high it's nearly impossible to see over the tops, are grimy from years of use.  Spots of rust mark the metal, the rivets surrounded by clouds of deep red which drip down the panels.  A metal bench is mounted around the cart's sidewalls to serve as rudimentary seating."
