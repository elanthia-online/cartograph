  "description": [
    "Condensation drips from the ceiling beams and runs down the redwood walls to disappear into a drain in the far corner, leaving the floor slick with moisture.  A spacious tub has been dropped into a hole in the redwood floor, and hot seawater swirls and foams within.  A metal vat is securely bolted against the wall with a pipe and a chain hanging down just above the tub.  Wide steps lead into the tub's churning waters."
