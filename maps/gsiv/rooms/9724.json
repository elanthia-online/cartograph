    "As the trail comes in close proximity to the huge oak tree dominating the landscape, it fades into nothing other than scattered stones.  At the foot of the monster tree is a long platform.  A steep flight of stairs gives access to the ledge, which stands higher than a giantman.  Wings branch from either end in southwest and southeast directions, following the circumference of the tree.",
