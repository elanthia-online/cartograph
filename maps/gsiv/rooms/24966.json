    "The lane ends at the entrance to the mill, the grand water-wheel motionless and the stream bed dry and rocky.  Behind it, a screen of grey willow trees loom over a pond, their gnarled branches reaching out to claim the small pools of muddy water scattered across the bottom.  A piece of tattered canvas lies beside a small toy sailboat, run aground near the shore."
