    "A lone stone sarcophagus rests in the center of the crypt, seemingly unscathed by time or abuse.  The creation of the passage through the northern wall has all but destroyed a series of runic dwarven scrawlings in the stone, whatever message had been carved there completely illegible due not only to the missing pieces but the cracks and crumbling of the scant remains.  All that is left of the once-telling stone lies in crumbled piles crowded in the groove between the crypt wall and floor."
