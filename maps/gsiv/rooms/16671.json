    "The broad sweep of the sand floor is interrupted by a scarred ship's figurehead.  Halfway to the seagrass ceiling, a circular fishing net hangs on one of the thin seaweed-covered walls.  A silk-covered dress mannequin and an oversized sea chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
