    "The arching support of the beams overhead are adorned in this area by small, beaded totems - some made of carved bone and others of various woods.  A raised firepit occupies the heart of the space, the smoke it creates escaping through a cleverly created flue amid the leather canopy above.  Figures and sigils of a stylized nature have been painted onto the leather walls in thick, darkly pigmented pastes."
