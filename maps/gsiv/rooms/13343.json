    "Thick hydrangea bushes in varying hues of pink, blue and lavender line the trail as it winds among the trees.  The boughs above whisper musically as the wind brushes along the edge of the nearby cliffs, occasionally permitting rays of sunlight to break through their deep green canopy.",
    "Thick hydrangea bushes in varying hues of pink, blue and lavender line the trail as it winds among the trees.  The boughs above whisper musically as the wind brushes along the edge of the nearby cliffs, occasionally permitting rays of silvery moonlight to break through their deep green canopy.",
    "Thick hydrangea bushes laden with white flowers line the trail as it winds among the trees.  The boughs above are interlaced, forming a thick canopy pierced only in a few places to let in views of the sky.  Here and there the remains of old architecture peek out of the ground cover, the bluish grey stonework worn soft at its broken edges."
