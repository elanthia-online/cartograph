  "description": [
    "Reflected in the chamber's polished jet floor tiles, a fel-inlaid haon desk takes up about a third of the room.  The Lady High Intercessor of Solhaven's Temple of Lorminstra is seated behind the desk, the mitre on her head, and the shoulders and sleeves of her robes, bedecked with gold symbols of ecclesiastical office.  Several scrolls lie partially unrolled on the desk before her, and a gold filigree inkwell and matching sand shaker stand to one side along with a pair of quills."
