    "This narrow cul-de-sac is dark even in daylight hours, concealed from the street beyond by a high wooden fence and shaded by a sheet of metal that protrudes from the warehouse above.  A stack of old crates is piled against the grey stone wall, and a few of them have been pulled aside to form an impromptu seating arrangement."
