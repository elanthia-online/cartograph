    "A detailed landscape painting hangs on one of the plain baby blue walls, and a painted nightscape ceiling rises overhead.  A sphere-topped black marble fountain sits in one corner of a smooth slate floor.  There is a gold-trimmed ebonwood chest on one side of the shop and an ora-bound large walnut trunk on the other."
