  "description": [
    "Pale mist, limned in starlight, stretches its ethereal tendrils across the landscape and touches upon everything with its icy cold fingers.  Fluctuating azure light from the energy that forms the walls and ceiling creates a steady, heartbeat-like pulse that echoes through the lunar sea.  A sunken ring recessed within golden tiles seems incredibly bright in the twilightesque haze."
