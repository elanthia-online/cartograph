    "The view from atop the gate stretches as far as the eye can see.  The bridge below is silhouetted against the brilliant blue waters of the Mistydeep River.  Crenellated parapets guard the top of the walkway above the Amaranth Gate and offer a safe vantage point for archers and spellcasters alike."
