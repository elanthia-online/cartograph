  "description": [
    "The road leads to a beach to the west and off into the distance to the east.  When the wind dies down, the sounds of the ocean can be heard.  Cawing gulls and crashing waves are not far off to the west.  The dirt of the road becomes more sandy to the west, and the plants grow more dry and rustle in the breeze."
