  "description": [
    "The surrounding rubble is damp, with little pools of water scattered between and atop various boulders and clusters of rocks, as well as a spattering of dead fish.  Trickles of black water cascade down from above, sourced from the almost invisible flow of a water snaking into a volomnious black void overhead.  Abutting where the water above ostensibly falls in heavy sheets when the void is not present, the wall has eroded away, leaving an opening where the rock has fallen in on itself and now provides egress.",
    "Pounding down from above, a rapidly rushing waterfall falls in heavy sheets, creating a shin-deep turbulent pool of water, large boulders and clusters of rock jutting from below the surface.  Before continuing on its way downstream in a miniature flood, the inky black water fades in color and visual texture to the normalized murk of the Locksmehr River."
