    "Large area rugs cover the floor from wall to wall, concealing both the dirt and the building's lack of proper wooden floorboards.  A nearby driftwood table prominently displays wares for sale, while a braided rug basket rests off to the side.  Along the back wall runs a well-stocked sturdy shelf with additional goods hanging from the multicolored hooks directly below it."
