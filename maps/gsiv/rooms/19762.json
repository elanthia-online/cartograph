  "description": [
    "Rising overhead, a magnificent crystal dome offers a wonderful view of the quartz-veined stalactites of the outer cavern.  Several benches are interspersed among the clusters of giant, luminescent toadstools, each group emitting light in a slightly different hue.  Empaths continually wander in and out of the area, taking as much time as they need to relax or catch up with a friend."
