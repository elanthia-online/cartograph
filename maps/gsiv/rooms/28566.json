    "A short brown bookcase lined with books stands behind a large oak table that is surrounded with chairs.  Residing near a blackened iron stove, a blue wash basin perches on a pale red cupboard filled with various herb-filled jars.  A green couch spreads out underneath a red-framed window across from the entry door.  Covering the entire floor of the room is a rug fashioned from various types of knotted cloth.  A curved arch passageway leads to another room in this modest abode."
