  "description": [
    "Although obscured by darkness and wisp-like clouds of vapor, the surface of the underground lake, oily and capped with shallow, foam-tipped waves, can still be glimpsed from the height of the ledge.  Along its rocky shores, where the dark water laps against the rugged stone of the cavern, a pale, yellowish phosphorescence glows dimly in the darkness."
