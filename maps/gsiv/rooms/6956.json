  "description": [
    "The trail narrows here as the forest undergrowth asserts itself over the feeble efforts of mankind.   Dark shadows from the massive, ancient trees distort your vision as you peer ahead along the fading path.   Little or no traffic seems to pass this way, or at least not recently.  What remains of the long forgotten road leads to the east and west."
