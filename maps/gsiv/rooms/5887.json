    "The east side of the path is dominated by a marble drake statue at the head of a pair of graves.  A low flame burns constantly in the statue's maw, smoke wafting from the nostrils of the beast.  A simple marble vase adorns each grave.  Fresh white roses fill both vases, while a single blue rose lies at the feet of the statue.",
    "The east side of the path is dominated by a marble drake statue at the head of a pair of graves.  A low flame burns constantly in the statue's maw, smoke wafting from the nostrils of the beast.  Moonlight gives the statue a pale glow, accenting the figure's fiery breath.  A simple marble vase adorns each grave.  Fresh white roses fill both vases, while a single blue rose lies at the feet of the statue."
