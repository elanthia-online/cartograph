    "Gilded fixtures are placed throughout the space, giving a touch of class to this elegant display room.  Spread across one section of flooring is a layer of clean straw bedding.  A gold-etched slatted hay rack has been affixed to some rough-hewn wall planks, beside an equally opulent gold-rimmed steel feed pail.  A display table resting in the straw shows off the appearance of a gold-plated watering trough.  Prominently nailed near the entrance is a large parchment notice."
