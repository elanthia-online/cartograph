  "description": [
    "High-reaching trees claim their domain in the dense wilderness environment, the canopy of leaf-laden branches allowing very little to penetrate the dense haze of mist.  Dappled light gives vision to the morning glory vines taking their toll on each one, their thick presence weighing down smaller branches until they droop solemnly towards the rich soil.  Fungi and rotting leaves keep each other company in the dim shadows, occasionally joined by a cluster of exotic flowers."
