  "description": [
    "The sharper slant of the terrain causes you to brace yourself against the rocky ground at an angle.  Small pebbles and clumps of dirt are dislodged by your progress.  The clatter of their descent echoes off the rising rock formations to the south as you utter a low, involuntary curse under your breath, chiding yourself for your clumsiness and lack of stealth."
