    "A damp chill rises from the stone floor.  Your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness that embraces you, revealing a small, cramped cell.  The faint glint of moisture glimmers on the walls, and the soft rustlings of animal life fill the musty air.  In the near absence of light you can barely make out an iron door leading out from the room."
