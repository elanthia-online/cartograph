  "description": [
    "In sharp contrast to the dilapidated exterior of this shack, the interior has been immaculately preserved.  The floor has been polished to a high shine and candlelight from a small brass candelabra overhead glints off of smooth, polished surfaces around the room.  A well-used leather chair sits in a corner of the room next to a large oak bookshelf that extends from floor to ceiling along one wall of the room.  Along the far wall is a plush featherbed with crisp clean linen sheets.  A steamer trunk rests at the foot of the bed."
