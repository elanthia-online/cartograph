    "The striking white-and-red marble flooring here is complemented by several thick rugs, predominately the hue of red sandstone, woven in a geometric pattern of seashells.

A single bright shaft of sunlight from one of the blue glaesine windows falls directly on a carved basalt arch piercing the eastern wall.",
