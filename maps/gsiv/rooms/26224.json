  "description": [
    "Aside from tools, mechanical bits, and numerous stacks of dark wooden crates, the foyer of this building is largely empty.  Near the eastern wall, a stack of lids lies toppled over beside a broken barrel.  To the west, a salesroom is visible, and a set of uneven stairs heads up to the second floor."
