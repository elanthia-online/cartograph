    "Tall, dented poles hold iron lanterns at the alley's entrance, though the narrow passage is by far more shadow than light.  The building on the south side bears only one balcony, upon which several pigeons roost.  A pile of rubble beneath the balcony is spattered with weeks' worth of bird droppings."
