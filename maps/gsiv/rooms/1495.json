  "description": [
    "Visible to the north between the wooden townhouses, the cut stone manors and stuccoed courtyard walls of the \"on stone\" portion of South 'Haven proclaim the wealth and status of their owners.  Extending to the southeast, Eider Run follows the edge of the wooden platform that supports all of the \"on water\" streets and buildings of South 'Haven.  The dwellings along this portion of Eider are constructed of fine woods and surrounded by large potted trees and ornamental shrubs."
