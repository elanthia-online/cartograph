    "The ever-present murmur of the river echoes here within the edge of the jungle walls, creating a slight relief from the stifling humidity as a cool night breeze penetrates the outer trees.  The dense canopy provided by the jungle rustles with activity as nocturnal creatures move about within the branches high overhead.  An occasional shaft of moonlight illuminates the surroundings, giving a glimpse of the inhabitants of the otherwise pitch-black environment.",
    "The ever-present murmur of the river echoes here within the edge of the jungle walls, creating a slight relief from the stifling humidity as a cool breeze penetrates the outer trees.  The dense canopy provided by the jungle rustles with activity as brightly plumed birds of all sizes and species flutter from branch to branch, chattering to each other or hunting for food.  An occasional insect hovers near a flower or plant, and mosquitoes buzz as they seek their next victim."
