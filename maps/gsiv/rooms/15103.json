    "A pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a raised fel panel ceiling rises overhead.  A brass flowerpot sits in one corner of an enameled hardwood floor.  There is a glass-topped mistwood counter on one side of the shop and a jewel-inlaid caddy on the other."
