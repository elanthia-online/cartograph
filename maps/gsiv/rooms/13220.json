    "Walls of dark granite encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting an ancient black oak hangs along one wall, opposite a roaring hearth.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the fresh scent of pine rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its somber green linen snugly tucked."
