    "Spectres crowd around you.  Their ghostly hands reach out to touch you, seeking the warmth and vitality only the living have.  But as each grasping figure makes contact it draws back, wailing in pain as if burned.  Still the others seek to feel you, expressions of hunger on their haunted faces."
