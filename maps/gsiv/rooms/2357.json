  "description": [
    "A small lake has formed here, making this a popular spot for the local wildlife.  A huge grouping of penguins lives on the shore of the lake, waddling comically around the edge, preening or catching the cold water fish.  A smooth area on the bank makes an ideal slide for the creatures and, looking more closely, it seems you could join in the fun."
