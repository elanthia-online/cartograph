  "description": [
    "A short wrought iron railing encloses this space, which is little more than a flat tower roof.  Open to the night sky above, the expanse of the heavens appears without limit.  A polished oak table holds a few charts, which are open and held down with glass paperweights.  A long divan covered in pale blue linen provides a comfortable place to rest, and a copper-banded spyglass sits upon a silver stand, ready to observe the night sky.",
    "A short wrought iron railing encloses this space, which is little more than a flat tower roof.  Open to the sky above, the sun shines unhindered on every available surface.  Several large books sit closed upon a polished oak table next to a stack of rolled-up charts.  A long divan covered in pale blue linen provides a comfortable place to rest."
