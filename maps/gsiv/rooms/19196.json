    "A small fire burns quietly within a weathered stone fireplace, its meager warmth doing little to combat the otherwise chill breeze that stirs throughout the room.  Two brightly polished steel cutlasses are mounted upon the mantle above it, their curving blades crossed beneath the image of a leering skull carved into the stone.  Opposite the fireplace are a tall polished oak weapon rack and a wide polished oak armor stand."
