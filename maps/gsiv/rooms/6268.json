    "A fetid pond of murky green slime swirls lazily around a gurgling spring at the lowest point of the vale.  A circle of tumbled stones nearby suggests that this was once the site of a well, and a few scattered buckets and washboards hint that the kobolds might actually use the brackish filth here as a water supply.  It's not a pleasant thought."
