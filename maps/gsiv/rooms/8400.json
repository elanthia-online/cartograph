    "Two passages meet here in a short angled corner, creating a blind spot.  The lack of ambient light allows for no betraying shadows to even hint of what might lie beyond.  The smooth and rounded edge where the two walls come to a point has been worn down by the touch of many hands over time, perhaps from a need for caution."
