    "Shovels, picks and wooden beams lean against the walls, as do a variety of weapons.  Long grooves in the wall, even and deep, speak of an attempt to reopen the tunnels for business, but the work is far from complete.  A single iron shackle has rolled into one pocket in the dirt walls, as if hiding from any who would find it."
