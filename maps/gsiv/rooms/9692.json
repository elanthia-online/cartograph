    "The trees give ground at the edge of a swift stream, running through its rocky banks in a raging torrent.  A couple of large boulders sitting mid-stream send plumes of spray into the air as the water collides with them.  A few sunbeams penetrate the thick canopy of branches reaching out overhead from the trees lining the bank, creating flickering rainbows in the shifting cloud of mist.",
    "The trees give ground at the edge of a swift stream, running through its rocky banks in a raging torrent.  A couple of large boulders sitting mid-stream send plumes of spray into the air as the water collides with them.  A shifting pattern of moonlight penetrates the thick canopy of branches reaching out overhead from the trees lining the bank, sparkling off the roiling surface of the stream."
