  "description": [
    "The only source of illumination amidst the dark passageway comes from two iron sconces on either side of a jagged opening in one wall.  Despite no evidence of fire, a soft, eerie yellow glow permeates the air about the sconces, providing a hazy light to a small portion of the hall.  Cloaked in shadows, a barely discernable archway lies opposite a worn wooden door.  Set into the wall at the furthest end of the corridor is a thick steel door covered in wards and runes."
