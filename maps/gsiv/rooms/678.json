    "Carefully laid cobblestones melt into grass as the trail abruptly shifts, where woodlands meet the thriving hamlet.  A small wooden mill stands nearby, its waterwheel whirring busily as the water gurgles and sings its way through the buckets towards the pond's surface.  Several ducks float in the calmer areas of the millpond, basking in the sun's rays as they angle through the trees."
