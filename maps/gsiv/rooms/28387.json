    "Carved from a single huge block of white monir, this table has been handpainted with fastidious care.  Bright yellow suns stretch their wavy tendrils towards the tiny flowers that lean towards them, petals upraised as though worshipping the life-giving orbs.  A frosted-glass oil lamp hanging above the table completes the cheerful scene with its comfortable glow."
