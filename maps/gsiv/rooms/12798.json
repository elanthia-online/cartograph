    "A central pole supports a high canvas ceiling and burlap-lined walls.  Numerous clean but simple cots are lined in rows on one side of the tent, and stacks of woven cotton blankets and shreds of linen litter the other.  A few squat oil lamps hang from natural wood staves, providing the room with dim but focused lighting."
