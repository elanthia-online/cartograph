    "The day's crowds ebb and flow through the intersection of var and wey, some travelling in small casually conversing groups, and others hurrying about their business.  A small statue has been erected in the center of the cobblestoned intersection.",
    "The crowds are thin at this late hour, mostly walking alone and moving quickly towards their destinations.  A small statue has been erected in the center of the cobblestoned intersection.",
    "A small statue has been erected in the center of the cobblestoned intersection, surrounded by a low argent fence and placed atop a marble plinth.  The cobblestones continue around the public display, deep channels worn into the centermost stones in the roadway."
