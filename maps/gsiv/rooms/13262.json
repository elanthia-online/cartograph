    "The gently curving bridge rises high over the city, its glaesine abutments suspended above the ground without visible attachment.  Caeruil Arch spans to the northwest and beyond it, The Keep.  Silvery white marble blocks compose the walkway and at the arch's crown, a pair of crystal peacocks perch with wings outstretched as if readying for flight.  The octagonal granite keystone and its nearest neighbors are carved in intricate detail.",

    "The curved ends of the bridge rise to a long, flat walkway, whose marble columned sides and white span are held aloft on bracers of carved silvery blue stone.  Overhead is a mosaic of sapphire and silver.   Periodic lanterns along the bridge light the area with a diffuse blue glow.",
