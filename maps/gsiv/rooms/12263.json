    "The coral wall on either side of the path ends abruptly, as if the builder suddenly abandoned the project and went on to something else.  A pile of broken coral and miscellaneous building materials lies to one side of the pathway, and a stack of unused clay flowerpots rests beside it.  Beyond this point the sandy path widens and splits in two, going around a tall palm tree that has grown up in the middle of the passage.",
