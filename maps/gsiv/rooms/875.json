    "A chill breeze gusts through the pass, bringing with it the sharp, fresh scent of pine.  To the north, a full-grown pine tree, standing some twenty feet or more above the rocky floor, rises from a mound of broken shale and several layers of decaying pine needles.  Its trunk bent at an odd angle to catch any stray rays from the rarely seen sun, the old pine appears to have flourished in a realm where few large plants have a chance for survival."
