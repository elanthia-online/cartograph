    "A hole blown through a section of airship hull forms the entrance to this room, opening onto a scene of plunder.  A gem-inlaid black glaes ceiling evokes a starlit sky, complemented by the polished dusky glaesine walls.  Some scattered treasure chests rest upon a lushly green carpeted floor, surrounded by some voluptuous female pirate statuary.  In the center of them all stands a scantily clad pirate queen mannequin, positioned to leer at all who enter."
