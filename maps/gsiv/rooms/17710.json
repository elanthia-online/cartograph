    "Lining the walls of the dungeon cell are five skeletons still chained to the wall by heavy iron manacles.  Their skulls have all been crushed by some heavy object and slash marks cover their ribcages and limbs.  Threadbare tunics and blankets lie at the feet of the skeletons, ravaged by time and rodent teeth."
