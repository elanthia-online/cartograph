    "In the center of the room is an onyx and lapis-inlaid pool, its lip rising three feet above the floor.  The entire chamber is bathed in a preternatural turquoise light that shines from four lanterns symmetrically spaced around the room.  A mosaic of interwoven golden circles and silver triangles is inset in the walls ringing the pool."
