    "Molds and mosses growing on the sides of the stone spires take the place of leaves and bark that you might see in a forest of trees.  Instead of mottled browns and variegated greens, everything here is a dull, washed-out grey with only a hint of color here and there.  The dim illumination provided by some of the varieties of mold and fungi that glow with pale internal light is shadowy and insubstantial, a feeble mockery of true daylight."
