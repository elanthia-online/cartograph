    "Clear of greenery, a large bare circle is surrounded by crude wooden bleachers, tendrils of orchid vines twine about the legs.  Towering trees partially branch out over the area, blocking the moonlight.  Nearby, a hollowed stump buzzes with activity as a hive of honey bees go about their business.  A tall wooden gate leads through an expansive hedge wall that marks the perimeter."
