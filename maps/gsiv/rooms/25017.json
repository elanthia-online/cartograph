    "Smooth granite walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above a tiered alabaster fountain hangs an Arkati pantheon painting, and a varnished golden oak ceiling completes the picture.  A glaes-covered ebony display case and a brass treasure chest stand side by side in the middle of the room."
