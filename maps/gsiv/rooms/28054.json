    "Sycamore poles coated with tar provide support for the simple brown canvas walls that form the sprawling tent.  Two cots are arranged along the western wall away from the foot traffic and entry, the blanket-laden frames tall enough to require a step stool to access.  Sealed storage trunks are laden with river reed baskets in the forefront of the room, while wrought iron lanterns dangle from above to provide ample lighting."
