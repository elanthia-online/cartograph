    "Although the addition of a cheerful daisy bouquet and a knotted rag rug help give the room a homey touch, the splintery edges of the pine shelves and the crates pushed together to form a desk make it quite clear that this is still a warehouse.  A stack of grimy forms is in danger of toppling right off a makeshift table and onto the sawdust-littered floor.  Feeble rays of sunlight, filtering through a parchment-paned window, illuminate lethargic motes of drifting dust.",
