    "Heavily corroded brass curtain rods are barely intact over the archway leading westward, the curtains that once draped over the arch long gone.  A large crystal orb stands on a pedestal in the middle of the chamber, a bluish-green viscous fluid writhing on the interior of the sphere.  The sphere gives off a faint glow that fills the chamber, highlighting the alembics, phials, crucibles and retorts that rest on an old workbench."
