    "The avenue halts at the foot of a bridge, which lifts over the road in an exaggerated arch.  The span is painted in a rainbow of color, each curl and turn of wood calling for its own unique pigment.  Blossoms and vines are carved into the wooden handrails, rivaling the authentic lace of vines clinging to the bridge in detail and beauty.  The cottages below add color to the scene with the flowers blooming on their sod roofs."
