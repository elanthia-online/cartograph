  "description": [
    "A bored out hole scores the ceiling at the rear of this room, and a steady stream of water trickles down the wall, staining its path with smeared deposits of minerals.  The water has collected in a small pool at the base, where smooth stones in somber oceanic hues rest.  Just to the side of the waterfall is a bed made of a rocky outcropping that is accompanied by a small nightstand upon which stands a soot-shaded lamp."
