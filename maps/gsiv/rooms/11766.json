  "description": [
    "The bustling plaza is ringed by prosperous homes, their wrought iron gates decorated with climbing vines and blooming roses.  On the north side of the stone circle stands a small wooden building, its weathered appearance a gentle contrast to the stately whitewash of the surrounding homes.  Faint strains of music drift from its swinging doors."
