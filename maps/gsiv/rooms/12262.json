    "To the north, the path begins a slow climb up a hill toward a small hut with a thatched roof.  A banana tree laden with immature green fruit sits just off the pathway, next to a small pool of stagnant water.  Tall island grass and reeds have grown up around the tiny pond, taking advantage of the moist conditions.  A colorful yellow water bug propels itself across the surface of the murky water.",
    "To the north, the path begins a slow climb up a hill.  While torches have been placed here to light the darkness, it is hard to see much of the pathway.  A banana tree laden with fruit sits just off to the side, next to a small pool of stagnant water.  Tall island grass and reeds have grown up around the water, taking advantage of the moist conditions."
