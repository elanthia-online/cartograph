    "Attached to the circular shop westward, this small shed is more of a lean-to, complete with low ceiling and dirt floor.  The walls are stacked high with cords of wood, leaving little walking space for purchasing or perusal.  A lone elf stands against the far wall, absently brushing bits of dust and lint from his clothes."
