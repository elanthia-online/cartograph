    "Snow crunches beneath your feet as you walk along the narrow path through the forest.  The air is cold and crisp, and filled with the sharp scent of pine.  Startled by your approach, an owl takes flight from the cover of a nearby tree.  It passes so close you feel the rush of air from its wings."
