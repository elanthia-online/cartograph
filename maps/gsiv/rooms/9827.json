    "Soft echoes filter through the narrow passageway, muffled by the dense growth of lichen upon the walls.  The mildly fuzzy fungus covers nearly all of the twisting walls, creating odd round patterns of growth upon them.  A slight breeze whistles through the area, causing some of the looser particles of earth to swirl chaotically about."
