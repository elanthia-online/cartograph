    "The thickly layered walls of dried grass and reeds slope up to a point just above the level of a tall giantman's head.  A carved wooden lantern hangs from the apex, suspended on a chain of carved bamboo links.  The entire construction, though sturdily planted in the ground, sways and whistles whenever a particularly strong wind blows across the swamp."
