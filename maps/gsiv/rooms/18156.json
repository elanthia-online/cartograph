    "A dark triple-horned skull hangs over the door, its fanged maw gleaming with reflected light from the numerous candles placed throughout the room.  Rich rugs cover the floor, and a dark ebonwood desk is set along the northern wall, its surface riddled with a variety of carefully arranged paperwork and random bits of magical paraphernalia.  A few tapestries are hung from the wall, each bearing the insignia of the guild."
