    "Shelves, display cases, and boxes of all sizes line the walls of this little shop.  Most anything an apprentice needs to start a profession as a wizard can be found here.  At the ends of long strings of twine, shards of crystal dangle from the ceiling, emitting a dull glow that illuminates the shop."
