    "An ebonwood gate, standing between the rampart wall and the path, draws a boundary between life and death in the surrounding area.  On the southern side of the gate, wildflowers thrive and greenery abounds.  On the northern side of the gate, the columns of names of the dead march inexorably across the black basalt wall.  A small pedestal holding a black and white marble offering plate stands at the base of the gate."
