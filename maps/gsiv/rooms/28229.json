    "Along the western wall stretches a wood-framed canvas map, its details and colors painstakingly illustrated.  Mounted above a thick oak door is a stuffed bluish-grey krolvin head, its mouth eternally pried open in a silent bark.  A wide slate-topped table rests perfectly center in the room, wooden chairs positioned around its edges.  A small shelf hangs in a corner, containing a pile of chalk and some map markers."
