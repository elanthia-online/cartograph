    "The formal living area just past the wide crystal-paned door is lined with dark mahogany wainscoting, and a plush velvet rug protects the polished hardwood floors.  A large bay window fitted with a wide seating bench sits catty-corner to a polished marble fireplace, and the aromatic scent of smoke wafts through a curving archway in the wall opposite it.  Framing the archway is a tall apothecary rack and a polished glass-topped case."
