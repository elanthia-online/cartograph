    "The scent of lavender fills your nostrils in this space, as a pair of stone pots containing large lavender plants in full bloom rest on either side of the wooden doors.  The walls are painted a pale green, and the carpet underfoot is a complementary, slightly darker green with an intricate pattern of interlaced deep blue woven throughout it.  A large writing desk stands in the middle of the space, and directly behind it stands a large picture window looking out onto the street."
