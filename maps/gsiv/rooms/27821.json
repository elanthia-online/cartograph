  "description": [
    "A wide stairway of pale gold marble fills the hall, disappearing around the sharp curve of the wall as it descends.  Scrolled golden oak banisters on brass posts flank the top of the stair, and a long scarlet rug spills down its center.  Along the curved walls, long floral tapestries alternate with the bright glow of gaily flickering lanterns."
