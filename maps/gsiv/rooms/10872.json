    "Although this small yard is just a short distance from the noise and bustle of the Commons Circle, it's remarkably tranquil.  The frond-roofed, stucco bungalow is painted a cheery yellow with bright green shutters.  Moonlight, dappled by the trees, plays off a brass sign hanging above the door of the bungalow.  In the farthest corner of the yard is an egg-shaped bee hive.",
