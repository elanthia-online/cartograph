  "description": [
    "Dozens of river reed baskets line the lamb's wool walls of the tent, their sides distended from the weight of the contents they carry, while three oak barrels fitted with bronze bands rest in the center of the space upon wooden planks that keep them out of the muck.  A shielded lantern provides ample lighting and is secured to the crossed poles along the roof of the ceiling, while a small brazier nearby struggles to dispel the chill in the air."
