  "description": [
    "A wide path of lush grass spreads out before gradually giving way to the crystalline waters of a small lake.  Beneath the bright surface of the pond, the periodic fleck of silvery fish can be seen swimming about.  Pockets of nebulous grey mist float lazily along the lake's surface and edges, occasionally broken up as spotted deer appear and bend their necks to lap thirstily at the waters."
