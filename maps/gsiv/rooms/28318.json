    "Rows of white stall doors line the inside of the stables.  Tiny golden plaques embossed with a number are fixed to each one.  Bales of straw and are stacked against the far wall, while sacks of grain are piled nearby.  The floor has been swept clean, and the varnished wood beneath shines in the light shed by a trio of lanterns hanging from the ceiling."
