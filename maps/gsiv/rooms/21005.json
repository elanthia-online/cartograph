    "Moisture hangs in the air, creating a heavy thickness to the environment.  The light buzzing sound of bugs and birds creeps through the area, originating from every direction under the endless green jungle canopy.  On a thick gum tree next to the muddy riverbank, several small, green tree frogs sit in a neat row, the vivid colors around their eyes betraying their otherwise camoflauged sitting spot.  Somehow, through the heat and thick foliage, the path is still barely visible."
