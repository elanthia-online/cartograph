    "Muffled footsteps and voices from the floor above filter through an air grille high on the end wall and echo in this wide hallway.  It is sparsely furnished, boasting only a wooden bench set opposite a tanned leather curtain which rustles in a draft.  A sturdy iron-reinforced door bars your way to the north."
