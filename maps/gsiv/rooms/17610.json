    "Behind an ornate bar crafted of onyx and trimmed in gold, a dazzling array of flawless crystal decanters filled with colorful liquors have been displayed upon a tier of glass shelves.  An interesting sculpture of silver and wood that has been suspended from the ceiling serves to hold the snifters, glasses, and goblets used for the cocktails."
