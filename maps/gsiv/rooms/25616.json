    "Rising from a thick section of forest at the island's core, what first appeared to be a startlingly uniform rock pillar can now be seen as a colossal hexagonal tower.  Six smaller turrets, each staggered at a different height around its circumference, peer eerily outward.  The woodlands here are wild and dense, with animal signs all around, yet the air is unnaturally silent.  Even the Mistydeep seems muted, as if preserving some long-forgotten secret."
