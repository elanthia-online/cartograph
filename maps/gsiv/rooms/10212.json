    "The merry trilling of meadow fowl hiding in the grass provides a gentle background music to the constant whisper of water rushing along the streambed.  A shaggy apple sapling has sprouted near the banks of the stream, escaping the confines of the orchard to the east.  The tree trails delicate branches in the water of the stream, trembling the smooth surface with each passing breeze.",
