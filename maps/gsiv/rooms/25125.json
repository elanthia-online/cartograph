    "Gold-framed mirrors hang from the tall ceiling suspended by long, gilded chains above a water-filled tub with a bottle of uncorked champagne bobbing near the petal-strewn surface.  Bolted to the ceiling and floor, iron bars line the entirety of the room.  A gold-framed portrait is hung from a mantle that presides over the crescent-shaped bed."
