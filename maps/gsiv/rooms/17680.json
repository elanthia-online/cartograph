Fluffs of rabbit fur litter the small room filled with the overpowering stench of animal refuse and sweat.  A half-eaten pickle lies near a bowl, and a krolvin skull sits nestled in one corner of the hutch.  The rabbit's chamber is surprisingly well-built from a hodgepodge of materials, from wood to stone, complete with a miniature riverstone vaulted ceiling.",
