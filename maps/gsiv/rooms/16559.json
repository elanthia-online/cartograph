    "An old elven war banner hangs on one of the smooth mistwood walls, and a sturdy bamboo-rafter ceiling rises overhead.  A serene golden wyvern fountain sits in one corner of a woven seagrass floor.  There is a long mistwood counter on one side of the shop and a rusted metal display rack on the other."
