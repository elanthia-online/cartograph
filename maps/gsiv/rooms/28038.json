    "Heat shimmers in the air, undulating in waves from three small hearths scattered through this area, which is walled off in spots by crumbling brickwork that looks far older than any of the equipment here.  Common anvils, blocky in shape, are centered between the three hearths, alongside several slack tubs, and two blacksmith's apprentices bustle about, tending to the hearths.  Forging tools -- tongs, chisels, fullers, hardys, hammers -- hang from ropes suspended throughout the area."
