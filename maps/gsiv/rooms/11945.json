    "A stone lion lies on its side at the edge of the road, toppled by the sinking of the pavement into a quagmire of mud that extends along the southern border of the path.  Identical statues, still standing, flank both edges of the road leading west.  Each leonine head is focused eternally forward, visage wrinkled in a fearsome snarl, oblivious to the unfortunate fate of their fallen companion."
