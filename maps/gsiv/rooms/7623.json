    "The wind shrieks down the beach, cutting through your clothes to raise goosebumps on your skin.  The bay shore curves in gently here, and the volcanic rocks to the south are just high enough to channel the wind down the beach.  To the northeast, a dark stone pillar rises out of the bay, its base eroded by the waves."
