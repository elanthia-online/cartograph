    "The platform turns sharply here, around the trunk of an ancient tanik tree, and features reinforced railings along both sides.  Coming to a stop at a raised section, steps climb up a set of risers that lead to a bar where several lengths of rope have been tied off.  The other end of those hempen cables soar high into the towering treetop canopy."
