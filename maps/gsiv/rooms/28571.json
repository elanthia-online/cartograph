    "Like the color of freshly turned earth, the walls of this chamber are a deep brown hue dry-brushed with swaths of bronze and copper.  Illustrations framed in gilt-leafed oak show the evolution of unarmed combat, with everything from stances to armor to weaponry diagrammed in detail.  Pairs of handwoven hemp rugs are aligned against each wall, while a circular one sits at the center."
