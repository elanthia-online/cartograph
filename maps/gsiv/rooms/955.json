  "description": [
    "Nearly twenty feet above the rock-strewn floor of the pass, a tangled nest of broken twigs, dried grasses, and other foraged debris clings to a small, jagged cleft in the stone wall.  The pale, tell-tale streaks just below the nest indicate the nature of its inhabitant, as well as the tiny splintered bones scattered about the rocks below."
