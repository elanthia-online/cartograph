  "description": [
    "Arranged near the opening of the short corridor, a long mahogany counter blocks entry into the foreman's working space.  Tidy cubbies dominate one wall, each meticulously labeled with manufacturer's name, while the opposite wall is filled with hooks that house wooden disks.  A small desk and chair complete the tidy area."
