  "description": [
    "Warm, dry, and well lit, the pleasant ambiance of this mid-sized chamber belies its seedy, subterranean location.  Despite cobwebs in the corners, the floor is newly swept and all dust has been cleared from the makeshift furnishings, as if in readiness for the owner's arrival.  A small niche has been chipped from the plaster, and some of the lathing has been removed to form a shelf within."
