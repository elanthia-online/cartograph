    "One wall of this room is comprised of a silver-framed glass mirror that stands from the beige carpeted floor to the plain white ceiling.  Marble vanities rest against the non-mirrored walls, alongside racks overflowing with costumes and a single rowan bench.  Make-up cases and other beauty products litter the surfaces of the vanities, and bright oil lamps light the space with a brilliant glow.  The door back to the hallway can barely be seen between two undressed mannequins."
