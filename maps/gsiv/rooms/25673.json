  "description": [
    "The south end of the Guild Gallery echoes its counterpart to the north.  Plush grey rugs and a couple of benches give no competition to the large canvases on high, neutral-toned walls.  The works are mostly of monumental size and the tone and drama of their compositions impart a timeless quality to the room's ambiance."
