  "description": [
    "A field of rushes fringe the edge of a forest, clinging to the foot of the trees with no visible break between the snarled grasses and the tree trunks.  From the verdure, the croak of frogs maintains a constant din, punctuated with the occasional booming outburst of a bullfrog.  Overhead, the boughs of the dark trees block out the moon with their thick foliage.",
    "A field of rushes fringe the edge of a forest, clinging to the foot of the trees with no visible break between the snarled grasses and the tree trunks.  Clouds of black flies hover over the rushes in a shifting curtain.  Overhead, the boughs of the dark trees block out the sunlight with their peculiar, black foliage."
