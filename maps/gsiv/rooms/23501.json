    "Light is sparse in this small space, with the single illuminating point hanging just above a gambling table set with a rich mahogany roulette wheel.  Shadows wrap around the walls, and each corner is clothed completely in a darkness, though low, muddled conversation emanates from those areas.  Hanging heavily in the air is a haze of smoke that smells of cigars.  Barely legible in the dim light, a rules poster, a numbers chart, and a betting sign hang adjacent to a heavy crimson curtain."
