    "The walls of the gorge are marked with a variety of cracks and crevices, seen in sketchy detail at best through the blowing snow and sleet.  An army could hide up in such a jumble of rocks without risk of discovery.  The scant excuse for a trail is forced to veer to the south by a formation of large boulders jutting from the ravine's north precipice."
