    "The  shop has the aromatic scent of tanned hides, filled as it is with floor-to-ceiling shelves which sport all manner of furs and leathers, each neatly rolled.  A tall stack of furs and pelts fills one corner as well. Over the curtain leading into the General Store, a horseshoe hangs askew, making one wonder if it'll fall with one more passage beneath its precarious perch."
