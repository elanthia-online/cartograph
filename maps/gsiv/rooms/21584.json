    "Wind chimes hanging from the branches of an old cottonwood tree create a pleasant metallic noise with each breeze.  The chimes look bright and new and the tree itself is well pruned.  A small pegasus statue stands facing the path under the tree with a small area for offerings on its pedestal.  The golden stone used to construct the statue is illuminated by a single candle placed in the offering bowl.  As it continues to the east, the path becomes stonier.",
