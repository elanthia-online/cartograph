    "Rent by twists that turn back on themselves relentlessly, the tunnel plunges steadily down into the mountain's bowels.  The air grows more fetid and heavy with smoke as its altitude drops.  Behind a contorted outcrop of glaes, a smaller tunnel takes a severe cant down, making the larger passage's progress seem almost gentle."
