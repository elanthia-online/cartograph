  "description": [
    "The flow of townsfolk along Changeling is a mix of merchants, craftsmen, servants and tradesmen, although more appear to be servants on specific errands at this time of night.  A two story building on the south side of the road at its bending is not a merchant's shop, judging by its tightly closed double-wide doors and neglected condition.  A faded sign above the door is barely readable in the lamplight.",
    "The flow of townsfolk along Changeling is a motley mix of merchants, craftsmen, and tradesmen, although a hearty compliment of servants in muted garb skirt the moonlit streets.  A gentle grassy slope leads northward to a stand of trees, beyond which the dark waters of the Sunderer's Glaive ebb and flow over a stretch of beach.  Steepled roofs of temples, faintly aglow in the moonlight, reflect off of the Glaive's northern waters.",
    "The flow of townsfolk along Changeling is a motley mix of merchants, craftsmen, and tradesmen, although a hearty compliment of servants in muted garb skirt the daylit streets.  A gentle grassy slope leads northward to a stand of trees, beyond which the crystal waters of the Sunderer's Glaive ebb and flow over a stretch of sparkling sand.  Steepled roofs of temples, dark against the day's radiance, reflect off of the Glaive's northern waters."
