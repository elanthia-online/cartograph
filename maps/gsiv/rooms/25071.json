    "A single, narrow hole is carved directly overhead, casting a spotlight into the center of the dungeon.  Water trickles down the moss-covered stone walls, the drops echoing loudly amidst the sounds of strange clicking, hissing, and screams.  The stairwell narrows as it continues down, deeper into the dungeon."
