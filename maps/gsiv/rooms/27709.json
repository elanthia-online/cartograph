    "Small piles of pale white snow collect in the corners of the tower's doorway, the pale grey stone glistening with faint moisture.  A spiral of stairs slowly ascends the height of the barbican, and distant shafts of light pierce the gloom further upwards.  An iron-barred gate guards the base of the winding stairway, the metal bars encased in a thin shell of glistening ice."
