  "description": [
    "The conifer forest envelops the path, cutting off most of the light to create a patchwork of light and shade.  Firs and cedars compete with pines and spruces for light, water and nutrients, and an abundance of all three must exist judging from the closely spaced nature of the tree trunks.  A soft carpet of snow and needles coats the ground, releasing a soft crunching sound with each step.  The trail seems to rise slightly to the west."
