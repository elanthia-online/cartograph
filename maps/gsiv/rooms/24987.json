    "Polished oak walls rise from a polished oak floor.  Just above a pile of striped throw pillows hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A flexible willow woven basket and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
