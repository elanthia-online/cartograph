    "This is Beldrin's office.  Though alone, the uneasy feeling that your movements do not go undetected persists.  A portrait of Beldrin hangs over a desk, depicting him flatteringly in the style of the Elanith masters.  A decanter of traesharm berry liqueur and two accounting ledgers, both labeled with identical dates, are atop the desk."
