    "Decay has set in to the property at its furthest untended fringes, tarnishing the ornate brass frames of the windows and cracking the stone of the foundation.  One of the pillars sprouting up from the slabs of the courtyard leans askew, marred by a dark handprint that has dried to the sullen red of river mud.  The pathway bends suddenly to the northwest, guided by a winding trail of copper disks laid into the ground."
