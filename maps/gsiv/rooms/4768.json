    "A hulking mass of leaf-strewn, rotting cloth lies across the broken path, resembling the fallen carcass of a large woodland creature.  At one time a tent of medium proportions, the decrepit material has collapsed in upon itself, the remnants of wooden support poles jutting out through the cloth at odd angles.  Tiny beetles, bearing shiny black carapaces, march across the surface of the wreck, seemingly unaware of the sickly-sweet odor which pervades the area.",
