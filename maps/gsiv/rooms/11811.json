    "Tall reeds and cattails block the line of sight on either side of the road.  Their stalks stand perfectly still as no breeze stirs the area.  In many places the cattails actually grow up through the road to separate the cobblestones and expose the water pooling just below road level.  Frogs croak and bellow deep within the covering vegetation, calling out to one another in a cacophony of amphibian sound."
