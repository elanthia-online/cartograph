  "description": [
    "Stacks of crates are piled along the paneled mahogany walls of the corridor, leaving just enough room to barely squeeze by.  Brass sconces holding thin crimson tapers cast a soft illumination upon the bare, rough oak floorboards.  Loud creaking from the floorboards echoes down the passage with each footfall of a passing patron or worker."
