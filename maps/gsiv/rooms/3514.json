    "A long, single story building stretches out in the shadow of the Keep.  Constructed of nearly-white limestone, the structure is pierced at regular intervals by pale blue glaesine windows.  Beds thick with begonias, anemones, and ivy nestled beneath neatly trimmed hedges surround the building.  An engraved faenor sign is mounted next to the front door.",
    "A long, single story building, a broken faenor sign mounted next to its front door, stretches out in the shadow of the Keep.  Dark soot stains the nearly white limestone, and all of the pale blue glaesine windows have been blown out.  The stench of burned plant life from the remains of nearby gardens hangs heavy in the air.",
    "The Guardian Keep looms over a long, single-story building with an engraved faenor sign mounted next to its front door.  Constructed of nearly white limestone, the structure is pierced at regular intervals by large windows.  Neatly trimmed hedges surround the building, and a number of city guardsmen stare into the night, torches held high.",
