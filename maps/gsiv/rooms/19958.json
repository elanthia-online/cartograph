    "Cream-hued walls flank the room on both sides as the hallway stretches off in two directions.  A dusky rose-hued marble floor houses a statue of a man and woman dressed in finery.  A large oak-framed painting hangs between two copper ensconced oil lanterns that add their flickering glow to the ambiance of the room.  A series of small oil paintings lines the wall opposite, their canvases remaining unframed."
