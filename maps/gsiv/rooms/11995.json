  "description": [
    "A spacious circular room chiseled directly out of the granite rock bed surrounds what may once have been a shallow pool.  The sides of the pool slope slowly down to the center of the room where they suddenly plunge into a dark hole perhaps six feet wide.  Circular stairs, cut into the walls of the room, rise to the Observatory above, following faded pictures inked into the granite.  A musty odor pervades the area, and there is a noticeable lack of air circulation."
