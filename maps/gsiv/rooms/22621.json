    "Standing tall along a back wall is a large witchwood wardrobe, its doors wide open revealing several shelves and drawers.  A single frosted globe hangs from the dark velvet roof above.  It is positioned to illuminate a trio of mannequins standing in the center of the room.  Rich crimson and gold silk wraps about the ironwood poles supporting the canopy, their lengths pooling on the thick ebon carpet covering the ground."
