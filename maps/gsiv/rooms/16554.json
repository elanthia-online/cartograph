    "The broad sweep of the sand floor is interrupted by a fishscale blue mermaid figurine.  Halfway to the skylight-set ceiling, a faded treasure map hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls.  An antique sailor's trunk and a brass treasure chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
