    "Centered in this spacious room is a copper-inlaid table surrounded by high-backed chairs, a dark crimson carpet underneath.  Stacked with piles of parchment, a carved wooden desk rests against the back wall.  A suit of steel armor stands at attention to one side of a steel-banded wooden door, while a teak-framed portrait hangs to the other."
