The bright reds and oranges of poppies flank the corners of the pergola, and the combined scent of the flowers is thick and heady.",
    "Fel posts and lintels form a pergola over the path, blending with the darkness of the night.  Benches made of the same wood are shaded within the structure by the draping vines of jasmine covering the columns and top, allowing only the barest trace of starlight to reach the path.  The heady, thick scent of poppies rise from the flowers at the corners of the pergola."
