    "The north face of the hill is dominated by a craggy cliff of mottled granite boulders.  The worn track passes beneath a stony ledge, spiraling uphill to the southwest and downhill to the east on either side.  Shadows cast by rocky outcroppings make footing treacherous and the narrow path nearly invisible.",
    "The north face of the hill is dominated by a craggy cliff of mottled grey granite boulders.  The worn track passes beneath a stony ledge, spiraling uphill to the southwest and downhill to the east on either side.  Sunlight reflects from the tiny shards of mica imbedded in the exposed granite and glitters like thousands upon thousands of tiny diamonds."
