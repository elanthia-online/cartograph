    "This small, congenial room has been set aside as a haven for guild members weary from training.  A small bar angles out from the wall.  A soft breeze, redolent with the scent of blackberries, wafts in through the open window.  An angry-looking parrot hops about inside a large bamboo cage hanging from the ceiling.  A simple monir sideboard holds refreshments."
