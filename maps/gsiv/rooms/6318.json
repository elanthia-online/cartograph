  "description": [
    "This tree shaded bower seems miles away from the noise and bustle of the party within the tent nearby.  A thick cushion of dry leaves and soft moss beckons you to rest your weary feet and relax for a time.  Songbirds high up in the branches overhead provide a gentle harmony to the strains of music from the party."
