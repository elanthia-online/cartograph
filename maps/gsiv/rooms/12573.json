    "The bough divides into smaller branches, which begin steep arcs up toward the life-giving sky above the forest canopy.  Trailing roots from clinging tank bromeliads give the fig branches a mossy appearance in the moonlight.  One monstrous specimen has sprouted off the main bough's edge, sporting long spiked leaves and huge flowers.",
    "The bough divides into smaller branches, which begin steep arcs up toward the life-giving sunlight above the forest canopy.  Trailing roots from clinging tank bromeliads give the fig branches a mossy appearance in the green-tinged light.  One monstrous specimen has sprouted off the main bough's edge, and a myriad of water insects can be seen within the well in the plant's center."
