    "Providing a touch of elegance, a great wool carpet of a rich claret hue with gold accents covers the grass inside this large tent.  Several sturdy maoral poles support the silk structure, creating peaks and valleys in the ceiling.  The sound of the tent fabric fluttering in an occasional breeze is accompanied by the festive voices and music filtering in from the meadow."
