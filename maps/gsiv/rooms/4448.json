    "Here in the quiet back area of the shop, multiple maoral display cases line the roughly hewn stone walls, each paired with some maoral shelves secured just above.  Sprawled hastily across the cracked and striated floor, a threadbare rug curls at the edges and leads through a narrow passage to the northwest."
