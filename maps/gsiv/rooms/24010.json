    "The flagstone walkway ends in an impressive cul-de-sac housing a limestone tavern.  Patrons stream in and out of the establishment amid near-constant chatter about the games.  Rows of mature cedar trees tower around the edge of the walk, creating a natural barrier to the wood beyond while filling the area with their intense aroma."
