    "A variety of verdant ivy adorns the walls, creeping along the high windows in a twining embrace.  The surroundings are a stark white -- the brilliant luster of the polished marble reflecting the light in beautiful, sparkling waves.  A deep black pool stands within the center of the room, its edges chased with delicate silver-hued designs."
