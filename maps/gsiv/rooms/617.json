    "The var is nearly deserted as it passes beneath the shelter of the high city wall to the north.  A gentle breeze coursing over the top of the wall sets some windchimes to ringing in the doorway of a darkened cottage.  A tiny kitten, roused from its nap on a bench in the yard, mews in protest at the disturbance.",
    "Several elves in traveling cloaks burdened with satchels and portmanteaux lumber in the direction of the airship docks visible to the east.  An elderly couple relaxing on a bench in their front yard looks on the travelers with an expression of mild pity as they nestle against each other in comfortable contentment.  A light wind courses over the top of the city wall to the north, setting the windchime hanging in the cottage doorway to ringing.",
    "The high city wall overlooks the var, restricting any viewshed to down the road in one direction or the other.  Near this barricade, several small houses are clustered together, making a modest neighborhood.  The road is wide and well-worn, residential neighborhood or not, here in proximity to the Ta'Illistim airship docks."
