    "A number of crates and kegs have been stacked here.  One crate has been undone, displaying a load of mugs and steins, and one keg has been opened to fill them.  Tables and chairs fill the room, and soft sofas line the walls, providing a nice place to relax.  A group of dwarves sits in the corner, laughing over jacks of ale.  A makeshift dark booth and a a cozy rudimentary booth have been partitioned off by stacks of crates.",
