    "The interior of this tiny wagon is awash in primary colors.  Brightly colored shelves cover nearly every square inch of the walls, their gilded curves glinting in the ambient light.  Tantalizing aromas fill the small space, emanating from somewhere behind the laquered counter at the rear of the wagon."
