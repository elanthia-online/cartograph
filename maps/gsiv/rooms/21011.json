    "A large spiderweb, its shimmering strands of sticky silk spread wide between two large trees, is dotted with the web-wrapped bodies of various insects as they await their fate.  Several vines dangle from the canopy overhead, looped over branches and creeping along others as they claim their territory within the jungle.  A family of beetle grubs crawls in and around the length of a fallen log, and a swarm of mosquitoes buzzes about the stagnant water pooled within the opening."
