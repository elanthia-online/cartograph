    "Long tendrils of hanging moss drape from the higher branches of the massive oak tree, deep silvery specks hiding within their soft recesses.  Blades of long grass rustle underfoot, their diminutive green forms complemented by random patches of wildflowers and colorful weeds of every type.  Several roots rise high into the air here, allowing one to sit and gaze upon the scenery."
