    "Unlit torches hang on both sides of the narrow opening in this section of the tunnel.  Various tools lie discarded in one corner, their wooden handles warped and rotting, making them unusable.  Without warning, an onslaught of pebbles and dust rains down from above making it quite difficult to breathe."
