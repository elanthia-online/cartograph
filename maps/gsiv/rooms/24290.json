    "Bookshelves stacked neatly with books and maps line the walls.  A black bear-skin rug stretches across the floor under inviting armchairs and round tables.  A window overlooks the cold, wind-blown forest scenery, the tall mountains in the distance looming over the snow-covered evergreen trees."
