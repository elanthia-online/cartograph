    "The trail leads in a general direction to the east and west, veering around boulders but making steady progress through the tall grass.  The boulders all seem to be of the same type of rock.  Their dark grey facets glisten with moisture and their surfaces are smooth to the touch.  They protrude in various sizes from the grasslands, some round, some pointed, some erratically shaped, and some even suggesting the forms of different animals."
