    "The solemn decorations lend an air of austerity and functionality to the main guardroom.  The room is busy with traffic of towns guardsmen loitering about in between their shifts.  A rack of polished weapons stands beside a large podium that dominates the center of the room.  Upon his high perch, the Sergeant-at-Arms pores over the everyday duties of law enforcement.  A darkened stairwell proceeds ominously down from beyond a steel gate."
