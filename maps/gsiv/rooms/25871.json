    "The exposed timber ceiling is centered with a gold chandelier hanging from a polished golden chain, while a smooth sandstone floor adds a touch of warmth and coziness to this large open room.  Two bay windows split the northern wall, allowing moonlight to spill across a low granite island in the center of the room.  Hammered into the grey stone wall is a polished veil iron rack, dangling a variety of pots and pans above a quaint cast iron stove flanked by granite topped cabinets that nicely offset the dark teak wainscotting."
