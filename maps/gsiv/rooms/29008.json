    "Echoing from floors above, the sound of industry is overly loud in the showroom as hammering, sawing, and the pounding of many feet reverberates through the ceiling.  Support posts flank the entry, with more evenly spaced down the length of the open space, each displaying a different style of ship's wheel fashioned of different woods.  A smooth mahogany counter sits in the center of the showroom beneath a large wrought iron chandelier."
