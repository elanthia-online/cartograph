  "description": [
    "The heady scent of incense smoke hangs serenely over the spartan chapel, its stone floors illuminated in mottled tones of rich color by arched stained glass windows that raise the ceiling.  A simple woolen prayer mat rests before an unadorned white marble altar.  Framing the chamber, plain candles line the flat tops of the stone wall's pilasters, casting a secondary golden glow over the shrine."
