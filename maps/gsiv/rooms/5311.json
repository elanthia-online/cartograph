    "An interior wall has fallen over, creating many crevices for dust and pine needles to blow into.  Marble-sized pieces of yellow topaz roll on the floor, each with a black cats-eye slit in the center.  Twisted gold candelabras lean against the walls, threatening to fall over with the slightest movement."
