  "description": [
    "Hanging down from the top of the white canvas walls, buckets attached to thin twisted ropes dangle in the air just above the blue tile flooring.  Tiny flowers, each a pink or purple shade, hang from nearly indiscernible wires tied to the ceiling.  Complementing the ceiling decor, the white canvas walls are dyed pink and purple in several spots, where thinly painted black lines form simple flowering shapes around the color."
