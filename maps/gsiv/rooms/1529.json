  "description": [
    "Large arched roofs accompanied by equally sharply-angled windows impart an almost ominous feel to the area, and the encroaching buildings do little to alleviate it.  The cobblestones lead off into different directions from here, brighter paths branching off to the west, while the distant manors huddle in the shadow of the wall of Vornavis to the east."
