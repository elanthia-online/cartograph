    "The smooth walls of the tunnel give way to a small cavern utilized as an entrance to the vast network of mining tunnels under the DragonSpine.  Carts ricochet past on a double-railed metal track, stopping occasionally for brief instances to pick up passengers.  Several dwarves busily work the area, ensuring the carts travel rapidly towards their destination."
