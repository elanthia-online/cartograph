    "[Apple Orchard]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A stream to the north gurgles as it flows, joining the rise of low hills in preventing further growth of the orchard.  The old apple trees grow right up to the stream's edge, dropping a leaf into the rushing waters now and again.  Like a child's toy paper boat, the leaves are quickly swept downstream and out of sight."
