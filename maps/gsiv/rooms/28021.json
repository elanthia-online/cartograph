    "The road from the southeast widens and is scattered with straw, the soft ground trampled with countless hooves and boots.  Squires laden with lances stand ready at an opening in a pennant-festooned, wooden barrier separating the viewing stands from the competition.  Hanging from a badly painted sign, a mangled silver spur glints in the sunlight.",
