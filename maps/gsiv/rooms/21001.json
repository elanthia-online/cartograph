  "description": [
    "Ferns and flora burst out of the bottom of the cliff face, and mossy vines hang down from above, their curling ends tangling in birds of paradise, torch ginger, and golden goddess blossoms.  The exotic plants, however, merely provide a fragrant border dwarfed by a dark pool of water that a heavy stream of water splashes into with an oddly distinct delicacy.  In the darkness, chittering and scampering sounds are clearly audible, and a pair of yellowed eyes stare out from a branch just overhead."
