  "description": [
    "An elegant grey marble arch opens up the northern wall, its surface swept with whirling, opalescent patterns of pearly white vaalin.  An elaborate mosaic of a huge willow tree is set upon the floor, its sagging boughs and thin vines reaching the edge of the room.  Pale mistwood has been inlaid around the design in a thick knotwork border, the rich varnish bringing out its dark muted hues perfectly.  Ivory columns flank the arch, their rounded forms swirled with an intricate spiral of golden leaves."
