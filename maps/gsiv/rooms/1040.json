    "Something has died very near the trail.  The sickly sweet aroma of rotting flesh hangs as thickly in the air as the surrounding mists, and the intermittent scraping movements of small animals somewhere out in the grass indicate that others are either searching for or have found the carcass.  Occasionally a small snarl or a high-pitched shriek cuts the air, but for the most part the area is as silent as whatever is slowly decomposing out in the fog."
