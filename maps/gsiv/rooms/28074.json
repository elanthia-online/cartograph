    "Luxurious swathes of matte almond silk culminate in a high-reaching peak and drape down over a bamboo frame to serve as an austere shopping tent.  The back area houses some pearly white pine shelves, each spread with buttery suede lining to protect the delicate wares.  Beside an elongated silver-framed counter sitting at the center of the room is a graduated mistwood stand displaying a plethora of fine instruments that rest upon quilted satin."
