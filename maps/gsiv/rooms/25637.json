    "Thick-boled sycamores encircle this grassy clearing, their branches encroaching into the open sky overhead and casting dappled shadows, ever shifting in the breezes.  At the center of the clearing, a circle of stones traces a firepit surrounded by an assortment of logs stood on end, providing rough but functional seating.  A weathered shack crouches between two of the largest trees, its rough wooden shingles nearly matching their mottled trunks."
