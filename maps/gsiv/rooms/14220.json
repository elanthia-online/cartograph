  "description": [
    "Ivory sconces house flickering beeswax candles that cast an unsteady light into the narrow corridor.  Resting on each end of a long rosewood table, smoking brass censers emit the heady scent of myrrh and sandalwood into the air.  Running the length of the hallway, a thick rug, embroidered with threads of blue, teal and gold, quiets each footstep."
