  "description": [
    "Game trails, lightly trodden by both hooves and paws, snake sideways across the well-packed road.  Visibility lessens where the forest growth becomes denser in the distance, where broad and closely spaced trunks seem to huddle together for safety in the forest. The drone of buzzing insects presents a cacophonous symphony from the surrounding woodlands."
