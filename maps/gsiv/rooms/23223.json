    "Red brick ovens line the back wall of this enormous kitchen, permeating heat and succulent smells throughout the air.  A pair of short halfling cooks, both covered in flour and dressed in tall white hats and aprons, bustle about the area intently focused on their work.  A long white marble counter covered in pots, pans, and various utensils stretches through the center of the room, next to which is a vine-carved cherrywood pantry veined with icy blue glaes."
