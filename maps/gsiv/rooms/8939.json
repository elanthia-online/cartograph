    "The amorphous shapes carved into the stonework of the staircase give way here to more definite images graven in bas relief.  Arctic and red foxes, tall, gently-rounded penguins, cats of all sizes, and a lone snowshoe hare are pictured in an endless march across the expanse of wall, momentarily accompanying any wizard traversing the balcony.  Higher up, a veritable flock of various types of owls, rock ptarmigans, and a gyrfalcon patrol the stoneworker's sky."
