    "The jungle here is cleared away slightly, allowing for several shafts of sunlight to hit the muddy path.  Tufts of moss float just overhead, their loose lengths trailing down, though they fail to obscure the small hut in one direction.  Several large blooms of pink spring up around the base of one particularly thick and twisted twin-leaved rose tamarind covered in a mass of crawling red ants."
