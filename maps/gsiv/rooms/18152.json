  "description": [
    "The tunnel ends abruptly here, and the polished appearance of the surrounding rock takes on an even deeper luster in the brighter light.  A dark ebonwood door, a thin steel door, and a crystalline door are inset into the curved northern wall, their surfaces awash in the rippling light of many candelabras set throughout the small chamber.  Blackness shrouds the upper regions of the room in a murky haze.  Only brief glimpses of the ceiling are caught when the flames flare strongly."
