    "Underfoot, the stone balcony has been textured by thousands of chiseled grooves, every square inch of the overhanging having been shorne from the mountain itself.  Beyond the border of the railing set with planters, the sea stretches out like a silver-stippled black canvas.  All the same, the soft whisper of waves exists at the edge of hearing, and just below, the wan light of torches flickers against the rocks.  A round wrought iron table is at the heart of the balcony, along with several wrought iron chairs.",
    "Underfoot, the stone balcony has been textured by thousands of chiseled grooves, every square inch of the overhang having been shorn from the mountain itself.  The railing is laden with coralbell leaves that spill from oblong planters, while beyond, the sea stretches out in gilt-sheened ripples.  All around, the soft whisper of waves exists at the edge of hearing, and humid breezes waft over the terrace.  A round wrought iron table is at the heart of the balcony, along with several wrought iron chairs."
