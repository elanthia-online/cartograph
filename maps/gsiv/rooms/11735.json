    "A half-dome rises above the dungeon floor, constructed by the application of multiple ceiling vaults.  The black smooth stone of the dome forms a networks of intersecting lines that merge with concentric half-rings, which grow narrower towards the center of the ceiling.  Five black torch stands are set in a circle in the center of the room, directly beneath the ceiling, casting playful shadows across the entire area."
