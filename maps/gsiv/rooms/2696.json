  "description": [
    "The ice cave is bright with reflected light shining through the walls.  A fire pit is centered beneath walls that curve up to the ceiling in a dome.  Out of the driving wind, the small enclosure seems surprisingly snug.  A few rough skins are rolled in a pile toward the cave's further corners, too ragged to be worth anything, but still offering warmth in an emergency."
