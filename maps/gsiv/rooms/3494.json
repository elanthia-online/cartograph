    "The charred remains of a small stonework cottage sit at the edge of the var, covered in soot and ash. The roof has collapsed inward, and various chunks of stone litter the cobblestone path that leads to the structure.  Workers toil away at cleaning up the debris under the watchful eye of a squad of soldiers.",
