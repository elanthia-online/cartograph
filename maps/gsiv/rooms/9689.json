    "A sprawling azure canopy, painted like the sky it obscures, shades this open-air platform enclosed by sturdy fel railing.  The massive trunk of a linden tree rises through the heart of this cozy boutique, and several of its thick branches have been converted into makeshift clothing racks.  A florid orange tree nearby scents the air with a heady fragrance, drawing iridescent hummingbirds to flit through the shop in search of sweet nectar."
