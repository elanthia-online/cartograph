    "[Mountain Peak Room]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Walls of dark granite paneled in polished black oak encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a skyline of jagged mountain peaks hangs along one wall, opposite a softly glowing hearth.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the sharp scent of pine rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its dark grey linen snugly tucked."
