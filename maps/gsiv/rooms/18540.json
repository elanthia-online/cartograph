    "A break in the fence allows passage from this corner of the field back to town proper.  The lack of grass and the presence of deep ruts in the dirt indicate this as a frequently used route for both people and wagons.  Underfoot, the ground is soft and freshly turned, as indicated by the scent of plowed earth still lingering in the air and the rows that stretch out as far as the eye can see, dotted here and there with green sprouts just breaking ground."
