    "A golden-veined marble statue rises from a low flowerbed of blooming chrysanthemums, the puff-shaped flowers reaching no higher than its carven boots.  The statue has been meticulously detailed to resemble a young elven warrior, his stony visage frozen in a stern, indignant stare.  A pair of spiraling pair of columns flank the marble figure, their lower reaches entwined with verdant tendrils."
