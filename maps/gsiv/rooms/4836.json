    "Low-growing thanot shrubs, with towering pines growing behind them, enclose this area on three sides.  Hanging from a high branch is a large sack, suspended from a length of heavy twine.  A small lean-to appears to be used for storage, rather than sleeping.  In front of the lean-to, stones have been arranged to form a circle, with a larger dark stone placed in the center."
