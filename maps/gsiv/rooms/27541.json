    "Billowing heat spills from pillar-shaped fumaroles that rise of out azure and aquamarine pools along the northeastern edge of the cavern, the air growing thick and noxious with moisture and sulfur-laced warmth.  Small barriers of rolled stones, many displaying dried out barnacles along their jagged surfaces, form a barrier to lapping waters.  Spears fitted with torch bowls pierce the gravel to provide illumination for the wares that are on display in a sturdy ironwood rack and several driftwood crates."
