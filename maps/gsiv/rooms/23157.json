    "The deep pit is filled with bilious green muck, which froths and bubbles.  Diseased banyan branches dangle into the pit, writhing about the slime-coated walls.  A thick mist blankets the ground, making the confined area hot and humid.  Colorful lichen covers several rocks lodged into the pallid soil.  A narrow passageway leads into the depths of the pit."
