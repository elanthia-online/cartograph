    "This room is dominated by a beautifully preserved hearth, its handsome overmantel rich with carved grotesques and armorial bearings.  Wood-paneled walls surround it, and the whole is illuminated by three large, mullioned windows.  Tapestries decorate the walls, offering faded views of woodland scenes.  A small door on the north wall is crowned by a carved panel bearing an elaborate coat-of-arms."
