    "Dappled moonlight streams in through the gaps in the leafy ceiling and glitters across the items on a shallow metal tray.  Every footfall on the hard-packed dirt floor sends dust into the air, which dances in the moonbeams like tiny sprites.  Small golden trinkets decorate all four walls, and each one sparkles in the silvery light."
