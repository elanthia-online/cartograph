  "description": [
    "A small, semi-circular granite and limestone rock garden marks the end of the tunnel, illuminated by toadstools placed evenly around its perimeter.  Flanking an invar-barred gate are a pair of giant luminescent toadstools that provides the immediate area with a soft, blue-toned glow.  A sloping walkway leads to a large manor house that, unlike the neighboring homes, is a freestanding building and not merely an artist's creation."
