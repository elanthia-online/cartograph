  "description": [
    "Rugged cliffs offer panoramic views of the ocean below despite the darkness that seems to only enhance the layers of mist hanging around the island.  Carrying the sharp scent of the sea, cold evening winds rush through the area, stripping the plants bare.  Leafless trees, stunted by salt water, cling stubbornly to a rocky ledge.  Edging the sea cliffs to the east, the jungle waits menacingly in the shadows of night."
