    "Multiple game trails converge on this section of track, their winding tracks sending them deeper into the western and northern confines of the flame-topped aspen grove.  Westerly pathways flank the edges of an enormous jousting field surrounded by high viewing stands topped with colorful pennants.  The ringing sound of anvil strikes echoes from the northeast and is punctuated by the soft sound of neighing from the southeast.  A large wooden sign post laden with signs offers information on the area."
