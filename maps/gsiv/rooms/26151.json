  "description": [
    "The heart of the fortress is fed by four connecting passageways from the north, south, east, and west.  A glowing pylon perched on an elaborately carved stone platform emits a low hum that reverberates throughout the entire fortress.  Tendrils of viridian light spill from the crystal mechanism and snake through the air down all four corridors."
