    "A faded treasure map hangs on one of the celadon marble walls, and a mistwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A woven Vornavian silk rug sits in one corner of a glossy mahogany floor.  There is a glass-topped mistwood counter on one side of the shop and a flexible willow woven basket on the other."
