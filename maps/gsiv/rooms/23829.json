    "The gibbets for which the bridge is named are barely visible just beyond its northern end.  Heavy timbers make up the bridge and stretch out over the Cairnfang River as it flows west to the bay, but end in jagged splinters halfway across, preventing passage across to the northern side.  A blackened executioner's sword is thrust point first into the faint remains of a sigil-inscribed circle that is visible just before the bridge's abrupt end."
