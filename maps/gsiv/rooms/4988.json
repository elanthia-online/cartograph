    "Both walls and floor seem to glitter and sparkle from pieces of ore which are embedded within them.  Corroded carts are turned over on their sides not far from the tracks that were once used to carry the ore the miners freed to the outside of the cavern to be used in a nearby town.  The tracks are bent and twisted, perhaps by a huge burrowing creature."
