  "description": [
    "Thick forests dominated by pine and spruce obscure the southern approaches to the city.  To the north, the wall looms over Barter Alley, which attracts a very respectable clientele among the halfling citizens of Icemule Trace.  The prevailing winds blow perpendicular to the South Wall, causing a tremendous buildup of frosty muck in the southern corner of the wall."
