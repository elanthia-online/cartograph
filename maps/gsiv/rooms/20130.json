    "The airy, open chamber is multi-leveled, arising organically out of a wind-carved pocket within the monumental trunk of the tree.  A similar pocket leads out from the room, and several of the heavy boughs are wide enough to act as paths in their own rights.  A single burning lantern hangs from the ceiling, illuminating a staircase leading further up into the canopy and a spiraling ramp leading downwards towards the base of the tree."
