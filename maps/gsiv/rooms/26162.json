  "description": [
    "Lichen and fungus appear to be at war with one another along the western expanse of the granite wall; their bright hues are a stark contrast to the dark of the stone.  Gyrating in the wind, ragged strips of fabric dangle from the wrought iron defensive spikes that protrude from the bulwark and cast strange, moving shadows throughout the area.  A series of tumbled cobblestones clutters the path."
