    "A soothing, babbling rush signals that a waterfall is close by, yet the thick foliage and plentiful trunks of the forest don't afford much of a view beyond the immediate trail and several steps off in any direction.  The incline ascends steeply to the northwest, yet appears to be leveling off towards the southwest."
