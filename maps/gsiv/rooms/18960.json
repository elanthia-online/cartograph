    "Dark walnut paneling and open beam construction make this room seem more spacious than it really is.  White polar bear furs and brown grizzly hides cover the floor, presenting comfortable places where one can just flop down and rest.  Trophy heads from tigers, pumas, and other fierce local beasts adorn the walls, appearing very much alive in the flickering firelight.  Two massive mammoth tusks leap out from the wall above a huge white sandstone fireplace that provides the room's only illumination."
