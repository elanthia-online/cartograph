  "description": [
    "Under the massive barbican is a shadowy passageway, with sturdy stone walls on each side and overhead.  Iron-barred windows provide access to this area from each of the barbican towers as well as from overhead, creating the distinct impression that someone is watching from the shadows.  The sharp spikes of raised portcullises jut from the ceiling at the western entrance to the city and the eastern exit to the wilds."
