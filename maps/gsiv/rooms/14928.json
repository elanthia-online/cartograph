    "The trail breaks at this junction, circling a white marble arbor veined with pale pink granite and vibrant carnelian.  Tightly closed cream-hued passionflowers are partially hidden amid their lush green foliage as they climb the four corner pillars and creep along the open-weave ora mesh above.",
    "The trail breaks at this junction, circling a white marble arbor veined with pale pink granite and vibrant carnelian.  Cream-hued passionflowers with deep purple centers climb the four corner pillars and creep along the open-weave ora mesh above.  The full blossoms release their exotically sweet and comforting scent.  Following the path of the sun, they welcome the golden rays that light up their pollen-coasted pistils like tiny golden charms."
