    "The remains of many collapsed buildings line the wide road, rubble and overgrowing weeds covering the worn cobblestones.  Several of the old residences have been pulled down, leaving vacant weed-filled lots in their place.  Amongst the rubble stand small mounds of stone, primitive shacks built by the inhabitants as protection against the elements.  A rusty fence, bent under the weight of time and the thick vines that cover it, opens to the south."
