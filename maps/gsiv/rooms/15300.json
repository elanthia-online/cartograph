    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a well-armed stocky warrior statue.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a sphere-hilted mounted sword plaque hangs on one of the celadon marble walls.  A bamboo rack and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
