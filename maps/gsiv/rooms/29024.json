    "Sunlight slips through the dense canopy to illuminate the uppermost rungs of a railing that is following the southern edge of a packed dirt road.  Short shrubs dense with berries grow along the cliff edge on the far side, while a thick forest of mixed conifers and hardwoods grows on the opposing side.  A discarded horse shoe is in a small brook that has been encouraged to travel under the roadway via a buried iron pipe.",
