    "In this eastern wing of the gallery, the sounds of visitors from the reception area to the west are somewhat muffled.  Lights from behind the sheer ice enclosures illuminate the contents of a whitewashed pine case with a worn brass plaque attached to it opposite a polished modwir sculpture in the shape of an inverted triangle, with a marble giantwoman effigy in the center of the room and several padded benches providing ample seating."
