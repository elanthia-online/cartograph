  "description": [
    "As you enter the bedchamber, your eyes are immediately drawn to the immense bed sitting in the middle of the room.  The walls are painted the same snow-white color as in the main chamber, and a sturdy oak desk takes up one of the corners.  The rest of the bedroom is fairly bare except for some battle-ready accessories hanging on hooks and close at hand."
