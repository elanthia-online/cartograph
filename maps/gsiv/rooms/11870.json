    "The short tunnel ends at a smooth granite wall.  A large pile of debris has mounded up against the wall, including pieces of petrified wood, bones, and other less recognizable items.  Atop these, near the water's edge, a very few examples of less durable items such as old leaves and bits of cloth reside, but for the most part the pile looks as if it has existed here a very long time, with only the hardiest items surviving."
