    "Stretched out before you is a dimly lit modwir table topped with smooth green felt, a magnificent black drake adorning its surface.  The eyes of the beast stare straight ahead, seemingly following any movement.  Resting atop the felt is a low-burning tallow candle, as well as three bone white ivory dice.  Behind the table stands an elegantly garbed dealer, his eyes blind and vacant.  His expression remains cold while his stick flashes out to scoop up the cubes."
