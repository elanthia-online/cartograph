  "description": [
    "The wide ledge ends in a steep cliff that drops off into a desolate vista of uninhabitable rocky shore stretching off to the west.  A path winds down to the shore to the north, and a set of narrow stone steps has been carved into the rock, providing a precarious ascent to an outcropping of rock above."
