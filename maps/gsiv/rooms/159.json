    "The cobblestone wey bends slightly to the north as if to avoid the uniquely landscaped estate to the east.  The tall privet hedge is divided by evenly-spaced gaps.  Behind these natural bars, a variety of large animals sculpted out of evergreen bushes roam the grounds.  Several leafy green roltons appear to trim the lawn, while a large cat stalks them from the shadows beside the manor house.",

    "The cobblestone wey bends slightly to the north to avoid the landscaped estate to the east.  The low, silver-spiked fence is divided by plinths set atop with urns of white roses.  Behind the bars, the grounds are an undulating plane of clover.  Several fruit trees trim the lawn -- blood oranges, green apples and white-skinned pears surround the property's large villa, lit lanterns hanging amidst the sweet bounty.",
