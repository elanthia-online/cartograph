    "Wind chimes hang in doorways up and down the thoroughfare, the breeze creating a cacaphony of jangling sound as it travels through the neighborhood.  Small insects buzz about, sailing from flower to flower in search of the perfect nectar for food.  The residents of the neighborhoods have larger sets of chimes near their doors, probably used to notify them when a visitor has arrived."
