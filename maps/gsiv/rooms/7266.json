    "Rushes droop over the bank of the creek, their long leaves trailing in the dark water and occasionally dipping beneath it as something rises from the depths to pull at them.  The mosquitoes are lively and swarm around anything that promises a meal.  A solitary and startlingly green frog rests itself on a rock at the water's edge, clearly well-fed even though the mosquitoes seem hungry.  Paths to the southeast and northeast lead to higher ground and away from the fast-moving but silent stream.",
