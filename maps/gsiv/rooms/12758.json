    "More intense waves of water crash loudly against the walls, and the sea can be seen stretching for miles to the east.  The entire eastern wall, as well as a small portion of the floor, have long since collapsed and fallen into the watery depths below.  Despite the missing wall, the ceiling above is firmly supported by several wide pillars."
