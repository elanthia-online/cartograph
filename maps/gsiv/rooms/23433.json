    "Bright curtains, their composite fabric lit from within by swirls of shifting color, swathe the walls of the circular chamber.  The velvet draperies muffle what sound and light they can from without, seeming to funnel and enhance the haunting whispers rising from a pool of pink liquid at the chamber's center.  Bright brass patterns are inlaid into the rutilated golden marble of the floor, spreading outward from the pool in jagged streaks."
