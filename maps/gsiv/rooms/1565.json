    "Curving to the southeast and northeast as they climb, two broad roadways circle the base of an ancient shell of a tower that stands just east of here.  A small court lies to the north of this intersection, but to the south the road bends to the southeast, forming a second circle around The Beacon.  Lit by a hand lantern, a pair of youths play a game of knucklebones against the retaining wall where the roadways diverge.",

Part way up the southeast roadway, a small boy plays with an old barrel hoop, repeatedly rolling it down the slope and chasing after it."
