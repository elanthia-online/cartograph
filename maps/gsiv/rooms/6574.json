    "This paneled passage connects the Great Hall to the old keep.  A row of tall, mullioned windows -- each with a window embrasure forming a 'sitting window' -- casts irregularly shaped reflections onto the broad beams of the floor.  They shift and fade in synchrony with the drifting fog outside."
