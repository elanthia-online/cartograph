    "The rough wooden wall of an old warehouse, broken only by the outline of a simple wooden door, bounds the north side of the courtyard.  The frosty ground is hard-packed and muddy around the several small tables and chairs that have been arranged near the stone wall of the gaming hall on the south side, where a small well provides a convenient source of water."
