  "description": [
    "A large, oil-coated chute constructed of iron plates narrows as it pierces the floor near the chamber's southern wall.  Two stove-in barrels lie in the southeast corner of the room, well away from the shallow brazier built into the floor in the room's center.  Heavy chains dangle from a set of pulleys mounted to the ceiling above the brazier.  A small fireplace is built into the portion of the west wall that backs onto the floor's western chamber."
