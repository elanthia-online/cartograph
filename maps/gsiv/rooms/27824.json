    "Flanked to the east and west by narrow doors, a spiraled balustrade separates the raised choir loft from the main floor of the great Chamber of Celebration.  The tiered loft curves with the convex south wall, backed by a line of narrow tapestries beneath rectangular stained glass windows.  The far wall to the north is a concave line of windows bleeding sunlight across the oak parquet floor.  Above, the vaulted ceiling is alight with painted frivolity."
