  "description": [
    "Tucked into this niche, away from the center of town, is a bench that has been carved from a segment of a massive tree trunk.  The bark along the top has been shaved away and sanded until a shallow depression for the seat has been created.  In a half-moon of intricately woven knotwork, the back of the bench rises, created from supple willow branches.  Off to one side is a bird bath, a glass basin perched securely atop an iron stand, with ivy-patterned prongs holding the bowl in place."
