    "The tunnel leans in a northeasterly direction, its wall carvings coiling into eddies of closely rendered designs.  High in the shadowy ceiling (and the ceiling is the tallest here in all the caverns), a dwarven artist, perhaps longing for a view of open skies, has carved a flight of birds in bas-relief.  The avian images whirl and turn in lifelike abandon.  Dim light afforded at that height lends distance to the birds, making them seem as real as if they are traversing the actual firmament."
