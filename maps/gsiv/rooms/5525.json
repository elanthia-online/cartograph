  "description": [
    "The flagstones paving the manor yard are more visible here along the front of the manor house, because the obstructing weeds have been trodden upon by foot traffic between the west door of the house and the tower on the rise just to the north.  Only a trio of thistles rooted tight against the manor house's foundation have persisted and now present prickly nuisances to those who pass by."
