  "description": [
    "Choked by black-leafed moon vines, several elephant ferns peak through the verdant foliage and stretch toward the dangling limbs of the banyan trees.  Shaggy strands of shredded moss drape in curtains across the murky pathway, their dusky brown tendrils fuzzy with white and black moss heads.  A series of blackened reeds create a dense barrier that separates the mud-soaked rocks of the landscape from the burbling, fetid sinkhole along the eastern border."
