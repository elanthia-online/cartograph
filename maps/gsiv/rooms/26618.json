  "description": [
    "The chamber ceiling is pierced by dozens of stalactites, the uneven spears thrusting downwards toward the web-covered ground, creating a difficult obstacle course en route to a large sconce-flanked hole.  The faint sounds of skittering reverberate between a pair of banded stalactites, their origins enshrouded by plumes of steam escaping from the ground below."
