    "The stained glaes rosette windows, capturing just enough moonlight from the night sky, cast a rainbow of shimmering color across the bank's pure white marble floors.  A richly hued Loenthran carpet, vibrant in shades of wine, sapphire and emerald, rests in front of the bank's entrance.",

    "The establishment's patrons wander through a corbelled stone arch.  Fashioned of the same mica-flecked granite that graces the Sapphire Gate, the arch towers above, nearly reaching the peak of the bank's vaulted ceiling.  The arch is carved with a pattern of sinuous dahcres.",

The establishment's patrons wander through the opening as they go about their business.  Set back in the wall is a small alcove that is partially obscured by a curtain of ivory velvet."
