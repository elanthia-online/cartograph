    "Bright purple vines cover the walls of the small hut.  Feathers of various sizes are hung from the ceiling, and in the corner sits a small water fountain.  A small wooden dresser sits in the center of the room, with a small sign on it that reads \"Men.\"  Next to it is a tall metal rack which is hung with a sign that reads \"Women.\""
