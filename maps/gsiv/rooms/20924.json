    "Several types of mangroves share space in this small area.  Moisture on many of the leaves gathers in small pools, dripping down to the ground when the liquid becomes overly burdensome.  The trees' intricate roots cluster together to make footing hazardous, yet at one point a small break in the natural support systems grants relatively easy access to a sandbar to the east."
