    "[Grocer's, Front Room]"

  "description": [
    "The front room of the grocer's is filled with shoppers toting bundles or hefting sacks over their shoulders.  Young lads swarm around, offering to help carry your goods for a few spare coppers.  From the west wafts an aroma of fresh foods, meats, cheeses and breads that causes your mouth to water.  Off in a secluded corner you see an area where a table has been surrounded by some partitions, affording some privacy for customers who choose to dine here."
