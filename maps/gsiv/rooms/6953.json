    "A large tree has fallen very near the path here, opening the forest canopy to the sky above.  Light from the sky above provides a welcome relief from the dense shade of the old forest.  A multitude of saplings cover the ground here, desperately struggling for the right to become the fallen tree's successor.  What remains of the old road reenters the forest on the east and west sides of the small clearing."
