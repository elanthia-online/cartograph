    "This small work area is partioned away from the rest of the large, circular chamber by some ill-assorted heavy silk rugs draped over wooden poles.  The center of the cramped space is dominated by a marble-topped workbench, on which rests a collection of alchemy equipment.  A shimmering beam of starlight, directed from the narrow aperture above the central chamber, shines on the white marble.",
