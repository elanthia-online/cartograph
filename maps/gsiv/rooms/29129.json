  "description": [
    "Two halves of a large, rough-barked pine drape precariously across the trail, threatening to block further passage should they be completely torn asunder at the base of the shattered trunk.  Scorch marks mar the woody pulp of the interior where nodules of amber, glass-like resins have been tempered to a hardened state.  Loose, flat slabs of limestone, cleaved off from the cliff face above, litter the narrow trail."
