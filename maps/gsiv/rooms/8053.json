    "It looks like a battle has taken place on this barren mountain side.  Bits and pieces of rusted metal fleck the light-grey granite.  A broken spear juts out from under a rock.  Near it lies a smashed mithril helm, rocking gently in the wind.  The sound of the helm's wobble adds a touch of gloom or sorrow to this place."
