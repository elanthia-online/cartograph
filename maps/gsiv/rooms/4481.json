  "description": [
    "Set within a handful of niches carved into the domed ceiling are radiant orbs, shining their light down upon this circular chamber.  A dark blue woven prayer mat rests before a low-lying table holding several lit votives.  The air is scented heavily with the aroma of sandalwood emanating from a pair of brass censers flanking a heavy crimson velvet curtain."
