    "The suede walls of the tent hang heavily to enclose this modest space, pooling on the ground to keep the air outside from seeping in.  From the ebonwood supports overhead, a handful of gold-bracketed lanterns dangle, their flames burning high within vented orb-shaped shades to provide an abundance of light.  At the edge of the space are several ebonwood displays of small arms, while the heart of the area is occupied by glass case."
