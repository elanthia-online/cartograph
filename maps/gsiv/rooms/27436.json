    "This area of straw-covered ground is fenced in by planks of wood held together and upright by copious amounts of wire and twine.  The loud cracks and pops of a large bonfire can be heard through a wire-covered crooked gate, whereas the occasional sound of some vicious beast can be heard from the direction of a loose-swinging door."
