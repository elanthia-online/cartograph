    "Swarms of black and green flies buzz around a revolting assortment of dead animal parts suspended from rough wooden beams on the ceiling of the dirt-floored hut.  Piles of stems and roots and a few crude baskets of mushrooms and berries cover most of the floor, most of them crawling with ants and beetles enjoying the feast of stored foodstuffs."
