    "Carved dark oak desks are organized in rows throughout the enormous library, each one with a matching chair.  Upon every desk rests a small glaes orb where a dim light glows from within, illuminating the reading space at all hours.  Countless bookcases are filed around the room, each one housing hundreds of tomes, scrolls, and maps."
