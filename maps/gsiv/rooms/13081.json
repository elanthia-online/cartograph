  "description": [
    "The path circles a centerpiece, carved of ice and never-melting in the frigid climes.  A huge tree is carved from the floe, each branch and twig perfect in detail.  It stretches glistening boughs over the roofs of cabins built around the glacial roots at its base, their thatched roofs shadowed with the delicate trace of its branches."
