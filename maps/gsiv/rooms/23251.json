    "Bobbing overhead, brilliant glowing orbs illuminate the interior of this formidable room.  From the solid granite walls to the polished marble floors, the entire room boasts an incredibly sturdy architecture.  Two rows of shelves ring the perimeter of the room at mid-height, and solid iron hooks bearing large rhimar buckets have been secured on each side of the thick veil iron-bound mistwood door.  A bold sign is poised above the hooks."
