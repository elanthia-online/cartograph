    "The corridor splits into three passages, all similar in appearance.  The murk makes directions seem non-existent, and the low-lying fog creates a slowly revolving vortex in the center of the tangents.  Every so often, the stone of the walls, floor and ceiling emits a low rumble, as though complaining of trespassers within its arteries."
