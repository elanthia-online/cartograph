  "description": [
    "Situated at a distance from the cistern, the balmy scent of the sea is faint here, barely present at all beneath the overriding stench of decay that hangs in the air like an ominous shroud.  Dark stains in thin trails and smeared handprints lead deeper into the area, most terminating at the edge of a discolored segment of stone in the cavern floor that stretches upward into the wall.  There is little else here save the odd oil lamp and bits of debris filling cracks and crevices in the stone."
