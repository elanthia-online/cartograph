  "description": [
    "Framed by an arched oak beam ceiling high overhead, the great windowless hall is lit by dimly glowing braziers set into each corner of the room.  A giant four-pointed star of cerulean-hued stone is inset into the center of the lightly buffed grey marble floor.  Standing open, some oak double doors lead further into the keep, while a pair of iron-bound doors lead outside."
