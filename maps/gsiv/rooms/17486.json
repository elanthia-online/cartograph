    "You find yourself in a narrow hallway that leads from the dining hall to the kitchen.  Scattered around the hallway are several serving carts, their tops showing off the remains of partially eaten food.  A long counter is set against one wall, just below a small window that looks out from the kitchen.  Savory-smelling smoke rises through the window."
