    "A large crag high on the slope cuts off the light from moon and star, cloaking the icy trail in deep darkness.  Clear ice over black stone dimly mirrors the image of those careful travelers who glance down to watch their footfalls on the slick surface.",
    "A large crag high on the slope shades the icy trail, creating a gloomy contrast with the bright sunshine beyond.  Clear ice over dark stone mirrors the images of those careful travelers who glance down to watch their footfalls on the slick surface."
