  "description": [
    "Heavily wrapped trusses secure the lower yardarm to the tall, rough wooden mast.  Frayed hemp brails dangle from the unfurled mainsail and shift across the deck in the light, easterly breeze.  High above, nearly lost in the shadows of the topsails, is a dilapidated crow's nest."
