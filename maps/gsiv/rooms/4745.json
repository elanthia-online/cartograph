    "The massive girth of a great oak rises from the entangled undergrowth, like an imposing monolith of the dark woods.  Its bark has changed to a stone-like grey and has splintered into jagged cracks, littering the forest floor with thin shards of bark.  The trunk of the giant tree is twice the size of a normal cottage, its uppermost branches lost within the shadows overhead.  A collection of broken boards lies half-buried in the nearby undergrowth, and twin cords hang down from an especially hearty branch.",
