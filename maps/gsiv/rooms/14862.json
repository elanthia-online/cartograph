    "The path ends at the foot of a forest pool.  A few leaves float languidly on its mirror-still surface, and beams of moonlight that are able to penetrate the heavy canopy overhead cast sparkling reflections on its surface.  At the water's north edge stands an ancient statue, the eyes looking to the distance in a timeless gaze.",
    "The path ends at the foot of a forest pool.  A few leaves float languidly on its mirror-still surface, and beams of light that are able to penetrate the heavy canopy overhead cast sparkling reflections on its surface.  Although the pool is crystal clear, its bottom is not visible, those nether regions lost in the black depths of some deep underground spring.  At its north edge stands an ancient statue, the eyes looking to the distance in a timeless gaze."
