    "Uneven, dark cobblestones emerge gradually from the sandy soil street to the southeast to pave the river walk as it heads west.  The north fork of the Tempest River flows swiftly to the right of the walk, interspersed with the first of many of a row of small docks and accompanying river craft.  Men and women move back and forth from dock to storehouse carrying crates and sacks.",
