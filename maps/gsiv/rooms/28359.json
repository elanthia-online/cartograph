    "Crystal wall sconces cast soft light upon the deep red velvet-covered walls, and a delicately filigreed cherrywood table accompanied by two matching chairs of dark cherrywood rests next to a sandstone fireplace.  Sitting regally in the corner is a handsome wrought iron featherbed covered with a satin crimson throw and dark red pillows, over which is hung an intricately woven tapestry."
