    "Tart Tunnel Way is rendered true to its name by the mouth-watering aroma of baking pastries, which wafts from one or more of the round doors clustered at this bend in the corridor.  Small groups of halflings stroll around the curve, smiling as they catch a whiff of the delicacies browning in nearby ovens.  On one wall is a carved panel depicting a bas-relief still-life of berries, scones and tarts."
