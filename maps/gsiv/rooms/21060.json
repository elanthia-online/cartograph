  "description": [
    "Jutting out of the massive sandstone rise that protects the coastline, a spur circles to the east around one edge of a spectacular river-sourced waterfall.  Above that lateral ridge, the cliffs themselves rise in majestic verticality.  Forest trees and underbrush, however, impede full sight of the scope of their grandeur.  Grey eucalypti, perfectly content to stretch long roots into the sedimentary rock of the environs, lend the uniquely crisp scent of their foliage to the moisture-laden air."
