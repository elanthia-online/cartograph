    "Bales of hay are stacked to the ceiling along the walls of the stable, and a single stool sits underneath a leather harness hanging from a low beam that stretches from the east wall to the west.  A myriad of tools used to clean and groom animals hang in an orderly fashion on an iron rack.  Below the tool rack is a small shelf filled with iron ingots."
