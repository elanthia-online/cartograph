    "Hanging amber glass lanterns illuminate the room with a soft gold glow, while chestnut carpeting softens footsteps and eliminates any harsh reflection from the overhead lighting.   The soft, calming hues are mimicked in the warm golden walls and the muted tapestries that decorate them.  Centrally located, a sign on a marble pedestal and a full-length mirror on a tripod stand in a circle of golden light, while two young elven attendants linger, never straying far from the center of the room."
