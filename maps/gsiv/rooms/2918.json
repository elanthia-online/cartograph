    "This shelf writhes around the mountain for a short distance to the east.  A large outcropping of pink granite juts out from the slope above, creating a canopy overhead that has kept the shelf mostly snow-free.  The outcropping does nothing to weaken the bitter winds, however.  Strewn over the ground are tufts of fur and gnawed bones, their presence marking this shelf as some creature's lair."
