    "The practice room is small, its walls paneled in dark wood that enhances the quiet ambiance.  The scent of aged wood and years of polish hang heavily in the air, paired with a slight tinge of mustiness, the trademark aroma of older buildings.  Other than a small hearth with a carved mantel on the south wall, the chamber's only furnishings are a chair and a music stand with a lyre-shaped top."
