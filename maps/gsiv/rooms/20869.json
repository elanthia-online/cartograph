    "The warmth radiating from the smokeless blue fires of the enchanted hearth make an excellent counterpoint to the storm-lashed sky the window displays.  Stuffed leather chairs and couches sit about the room, giving the room a homey feel.  Servants in cloaks with deep hoods wander in and out occasionally, carrying trays loaded with exotic culinary delights.  Flashes of lightning highlight the intricately carved motif that covers the western wall, throwing odd shadows across it, and a crystal-paned ebon marble case sits nearby."
