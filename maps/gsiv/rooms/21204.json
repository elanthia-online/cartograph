  "description": [
    "Roughly carved out of dirt, the terminus is surrounded on four sides by walls and has a small tunnel that leads towards a central nexus.  Spidery white roots decorate the smooth walls and the floor is pitted with oddly shaped rocks.  Four thick support posts mark the corners of the area, while a blackened iron ladder rises towards the knotty oak ceiling where a small trap door stands closed.  A waxed parchment is tacked near the ladder.",
    "A large fallen log rests underneath the shade of several of its companion trees, its roughened jagged-edged body covered in an array of vines and insects.  Butterflies flutter in and out of small patches of wildflowers flourishing near the edge of the jungle, their jewel-toned wings creating a subtle, yet distinctive, buzz in the humid air.  The presence of an occasional breeze, wafting in from the nearby river, alleviates the discomfort of the sauna-like surroundings."
