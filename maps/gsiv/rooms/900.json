    "Studded with protrusions and deep indentations, the irregular walls of the crevasse are difficult to navigate.  The screeching sound of metallic armor, iron buckles, and slung shields against the small outcroppings of rock are not uncommon, as travelers make the slow, methodic trek through the tight space."
