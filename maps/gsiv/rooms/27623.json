  "description": [
    "No debris litters the hard-packed ground of this roughly hewn passage, though boot prints and scuffs betray the presence of former travelers.  At intervals along the arching walls, small oil lamps are set in iron fittings, and they cast a wan light through sooty glass shades in a feeble effort to brighten the path."
