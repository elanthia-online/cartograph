    "Separated from the other boxcars by a black wool curtain, this area appears to be more of a residence than a shop.  A small desk folds down off of one wall beside a padded cot, while opposite is a small glass cabinet filled with a variety of colored bottles.  The driver's seat of the wagon has been folded up to create a makeshift back wall to the boxcar, allowing the room to be secluded from the outside world."
