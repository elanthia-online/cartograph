    "The tunnel doglegs, turning back on itself around a sharp protuberance of crystalline glaes.  The dark crystals jut from their sparkling bed of crusted mineral like a multifaceted forest.  Each one is different, and the largest are particularly beautiful.  They reach out from the wall halfway across the corridor, and if time had given them a chance to grow longer, they would effectively block the passageway."
