  "description": [
    "Black stripes have been painted upon the bright white walls in a flowing pattern to elicit the appearance of a zebra's hide.  Circles of lush, vibrant purple velvet have been draped over otherwise nondescript furniture, creating luxurious stands for the wagon's wares.  The smell of musky perfume is overpowering, though its source is not readily apparent."
