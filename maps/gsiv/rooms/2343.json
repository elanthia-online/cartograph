  "description": [
    "In a loose square at the center of the hall stand four altars clad with jade in the seasonal colors of green, yellow, brown and white.  The wall opposite each altar has been lined in a matching wood: supple young hazel at the east, yellow pine to the south, auburn maoral at the west, and white monir to the north.  Paintings depicting winter, spring, summer, and autumn hang on the four walls, framed in elaborately carved grey monir."
