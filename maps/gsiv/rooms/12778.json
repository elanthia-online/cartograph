    "Shadows seem to congregate here in the northeast corner of the cavern, as if plotting to overtake and defeat the luster of the scarlet floor slabs.  Drifting fog moves through the patches of darkness, giving them an appearance of movement and life.  The most dramatic and deeply toned are cast by the four towering columns grouped around the well at the chamber's heart."
