  "description": [
    "The porch is floored with wide, wooden planks, swept clean of snow and painted a wishful shade of green.  All down the length of it, rocking chairs sit in a row, silent in the winter hush.  This far north, the snow is a constant presence, transforming the row of pristine, green and white rockers into a wonderful winter folly.  Generous, albeit short, double doors lead into the building."
