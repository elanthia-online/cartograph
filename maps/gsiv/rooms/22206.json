    "Two stories above, the vaulted ceiling is adorned by chandeliers of vivid fire-hued crystal.  A commingling of crimson and golden light falls in shattered patches on the snowy marble floor and columns, setting them brightly ablaze.  The hall ends in a large eahnor-banded archway framing twin linden doors, with a set of gold-flecked stone steps guarded by a pair of brass braziers to its right.  Nearly hidden in the splendor is a wooden door leading into the eastern wall."
