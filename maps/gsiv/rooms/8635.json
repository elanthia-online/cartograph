    "Cushioned ladder-backed chairs surround a plush, snow white bear rug.  Affixed in the eye sockets are a pair of brilliant dragonsbreath sapphires and long, slightly yellowed pieces of ivory serve as the fangs.  Edged in gold braiding, the tapestry on the back wall depicts several males encircling a kneeling individual as they work together to wrestle an object from his grasp."
