  "description": [
    "Housed a bit further back from the main market thoroughfare, the stall is open-air, with only a small, thin strip of canvas overhead to protect the interior from the elements.  One side sports a long royal blue banner with a golden serpent, the other a black banner with a vermillion phoenix, with the back opening out into the woods.  The space is otherwise bare, save for a writing desk topped with swathes of cloth and embroidery supplies and a silver-edged table."
