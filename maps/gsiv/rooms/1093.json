    "The sparse trail follows the deep crevice to the west and southeast.  The roar of rushing water echoes up from the crevice's depths, but the torrent's view is lost in the inky blackness of the crevice.  The nearness of such a large volume of water does nothing to relieve the arid conditions as the wind, pouring out of the dry plateau's interior, carries away any hint of moisture.  The wind's continual howling mixed with the water's constant roar pounds dully at the auditory senses."
