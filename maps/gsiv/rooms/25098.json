    "Several rows of stacked cages are placed evenly apart down one wall, and another is hung with a collection of hammers and rakes.  The floor is swept clean of any hay, revealing the Reim crest carved with intricate detail in the oaken floorboards.  The ceiling sweeps upwards, creating a breathtaking vault of assorted aged and knotted woods."
