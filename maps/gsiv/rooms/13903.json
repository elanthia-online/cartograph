    "A trio-bladed mounted vellum fan hangs on one of the dark blue textured canvas walls, and a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of an ash grey granite floor.  There is a heavy lead glass display case on one side of the shop and some hammered copper display hooks on the other."
