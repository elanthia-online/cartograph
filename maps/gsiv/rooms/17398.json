    "An oil-filled copper sconce hangs on one of the rough white stucco walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is a set of carved felwood shelves on one side of the shop and a spacious grey slate counter on the other."
