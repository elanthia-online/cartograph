    "A detailed fresco stretches the length of this hall, detailing a view of the Shining City.  Each carefully depicted locale is separated by a dimly lit torch set in a brass sconce.  A plush narrow runner embroidered in touches of gold, lines the marbled floor, providing a soft footfall for travelers within the guild."
