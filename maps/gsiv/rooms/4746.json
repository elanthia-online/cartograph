  "description": [
    "Some forty feet above the forest floor, an arch-like opening in the great oak provides a small sheltered landing.  Naturally rounded and wrinkled with age, the archway seems to have opened of its own accord, rather than by artificial means.  Although dusty and laden with dried leaves, the natural floor of the landing is evenly contoured.  A cracked wheel and spool of heavy cord are all that remain of an old pulley system."
