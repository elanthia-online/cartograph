    "A thick ironwood frame surrounds a tall, rectangular tank that has one side to the room's western wall.  The aquarium sits upon a massive, flat-cut tree trunk, a few of its blunted roots left to stretch out across the floor like winding tentacles.  Large, dark forms can be seen moving within the water, though the container itself is not lit."
