    "Although the wide-planked floor is warped, it is waxed and polished to a high gleam.  The plaster walls, painted a cheery yellow, are decorated with small images of local flora.  A pair of brass oil lamps, mounted on opposite walls, add a flickering glow to the ambient moonlight from the window.  Beneath a series of brass hooks is a large modwir bin.  A tall rack stands against the wall.  A sturdy oak table stands in the center of the room.",
