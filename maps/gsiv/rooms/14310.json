    "The sharply-angled roofs of a few long warehouses mark the beginning of the Bonding Pier, its creaky planks stretching out into the bay.  Sailors unload their wares continually from moored vessels, and crewmen scramble to haul them into the numerous warehouses nearby.  To the southeast the pier merges into the Southbay Road."
