    "Shadows from the two-story Guild Hall creep across the lawn at this section of the courtyard.  A worn path leads south and east where it connects with the fountain and benches at the courtyard's center.  You are also treated to a reverse image of the expansive stained-glass window of the Halls' auditorium."
