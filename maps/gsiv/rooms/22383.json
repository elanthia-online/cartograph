    "Wreathed in colorful swathes of silk, the small shop has been decorated to resemble the interior of a merchant's pavilion.  Baskets of wares hang from the cloth-covered walls, while a long teak-paneled counter separates the merchant from the customers.  A large censer sits in the far corner and fills the air with the delicate scent of sandalwood."
