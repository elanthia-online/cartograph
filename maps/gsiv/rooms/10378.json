    "Amber spidersilk curtains waft gently in the stir of air drifting in through the open windows.  Glittering droplets of ruby-hued glaesine hanging from the arms of a chandelier cast small rays of crimson light across the spacious shop.  Various display cases show off both simple and ostentatious jewelry pieces to their best advantage.  A faenor-edged mithglin counter stands along the rear wall of the shop."
