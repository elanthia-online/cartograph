    "The stone floor is slimy and treacherous underfoot.  Although you find it difficult to see well enough to progress unaided, you hesitate to feel your way along the clammy, lichen-covered walls.  Water seeps from the ceiling with a constant dripping sound that echoes around you.  Disturbing grunts and squeals emanate from a particularly dark corner of the room."
