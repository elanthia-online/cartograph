    "An elaborate plaque hangs from the brass-trimmed door in the southern wall of this brightly lit hallway.  A pair of windows opposite the door looks down into the courtyard below, while allowing the sunlight to play off the door's trimmings.  A thick iron sconce set between the windows holds an unlit oil lamp."
