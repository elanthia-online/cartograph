    "From this vantage point, the small cove which centers the village looks like a shimmering jewel in the midst of all this destruction.  Crystal clear waters lap peacefully at the boulders surrounding the tiny inlet, and even though the vegetation nearby is untended, the contrast between the dark shades of the cove floor, and the lush green of the vines is extraordinarily beautiful."
