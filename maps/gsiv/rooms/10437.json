    "The stage, its underpinnings carved of rich darkly stained maoral, sits recessed into the theatre's back wall.  Thick garnet-hued velvet curtains, trimmed with glimmering golden cords and tassels, hang across the wall, providing a lush backdrop to the stage.  Creatively shuttered glaesine lanterns hanging from the rafters above direct warm golden light at the stage while leaving the seating area in almost complete darkness."
