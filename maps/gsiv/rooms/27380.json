    "A large number of giantmen, both male and female, gather about a large pavilion.  While mostly warriors, there seems to be at least one member of every profession imaginable present, from housewife to guard.  Each holds a sizeable stein in his or her hand, drinking as they stand about, chatting comfortably."
