    "Windswept trees line the trail as it winds up the cliffside, sloping down to the east and rising in a steep path away from the bay.  The wind whistles through the branches, filling the air with a faint howling.  Small cabins and cottages have been built along the trail, tucked into sheltered niches in the stone."
