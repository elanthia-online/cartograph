  "description": [
    "A variety of potted ferns thrive on the white-washed window sill, their numerous branches reaching almost to the floor in a cascade of green.  The only other source of color emanates from a rustic wall hanging depicting a quaint pastoral scene.  A scarred workbench, neatly laid out with various odd-looking apparatus, rests in the middle of the chamber."
