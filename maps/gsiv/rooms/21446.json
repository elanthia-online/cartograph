    "Lengths of gold, alabaster, and crimson silk wrap about the modwir poles that support the heavy ivory velvet of the pavilion ceiling.  A threesome of mannequins stand centered upon a thick carpet of exotic animal skins.  Standing to one side are a large mirror and several cushioned benches to assist customers in trying on and admiring the shop's extensive stock."
