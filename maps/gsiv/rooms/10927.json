    "El Kiza Alley is dank and dark, shadowed by the over-hang of ramshackle buildings crowding its length.  A gutter trench runs down the middle of the lane, and the paving stones on either side of it are irregular and treacherous.  Pockets of stale water are blocked here and there in the trench by garbage, and rats dart occasionally from cracks in building foundations to snatch a quick drink."
