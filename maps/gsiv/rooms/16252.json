  "description": [
    "The air, redolent with a cloyingly sweet smell, is still and humid.  The jungle undergrowth closes in on all sides, forming a nearly solid wall of green that ripples unnaturally.  The branches of tall trees loom overhead, trailing lianas over the pathway like the stingers of a jellyfish."
