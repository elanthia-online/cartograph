  "description": [
    "The incline narrows as it rises through the cavern of the tree's belly.  The light has grown softer with tones colored by the hanging globes from which it emanates.  A thick haze further obscures the illumination, giving the elevation a strangely intimate ambiance.  Barely visible in the heights above is the underside of a platform.  Its surface flickers with glowing motes reflecting from the globes suspended below it."
