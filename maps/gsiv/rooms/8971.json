  "description": [
    "Two hinged doors do little to keep the winds from swirling around this square keep, and the halfling militia guard that patrols the stairs shivers in the cold.  More spartan than drab, this room boasts little in the way of furniture: a small wooden trash barrel near the door, a few odd chairs, and some woolen tapestries on the walls."
