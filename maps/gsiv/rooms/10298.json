    "A large patch of wheat grows throughout the area, nearly blocking out the harsh glare of the sun with its tall stalks.  Some of the wheat appears to be matted, as if something had simply walked over it on their way through.  The flattened vegetation seems to follow some sort of curvy, winding trail, leading toward a towering dirt mound visible to the southeast.",
