    "The tank below has a crack in its outer wall.  Water that flows in from the other tanks is lost through the crack leaving this one dry.  A variety of different sized skeletons of fish lie scattered about the tank.  The only living thing in the tank is a small tree, growing near the center, that gathers its nourishment from the water that flows through."
