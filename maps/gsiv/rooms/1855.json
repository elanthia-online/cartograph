    "Vertical sandalwood boards panel the front of a tall building wedged snugly into the town wall's northeastern corner.  Arrows of various types dangle from the outcropping roofline, swaying lazily with the commotion of bodies rushing by.  Hanging above a narrow door, a tremendous greatbow draws your eye."
