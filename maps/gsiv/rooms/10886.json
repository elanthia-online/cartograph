    "Tall palisade walls of logged white birch trunks march into the vicious brambles on either side.  The tips of the log wall's trunks have been whittled to nasty points, and something brown and malodorous has been spread across these sharpened spires.  A wide piece of surfaced redwood arches over the open gate, upon which an insignia has been painted, and to one side something has been burned into the palisade wall itself.  Several torches illuminate the path and gate.",
