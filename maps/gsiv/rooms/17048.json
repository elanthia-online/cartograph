    "The smooth dome of the guild simply recedes to form a circular wall around a sprawling garden, and the sprawling greenery dark and lush beneath the moonlit sky above.  A series of weathered stones wind between the erratically placed beds of herbs and flowers, their grey surfaces overgrown with lichen and moss.",
    "The smooth dome of the guild simply recedes to form a circular wall around a sprawling garden, leaving the lush greenery open to the sky above.  A series of weathered stones wind between the erratically placed beds of herbs and flowers, their grey surfaces overgrown with lichen and moss.  Mushrooms thrive in the shade of the building, their spotted caps bright against the rich black soil."
