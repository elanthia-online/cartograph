  "description": [
    "Black cypress trees intermingle with small banyans, their bark covered in blackish grey lichen that gives the appearance of rot eating away at the trunks.  Moss drips down from above, much of it showering the vines that sprout yellow and green pumpkins, several of them spotted with splotches of white mold despite their unripe status."
