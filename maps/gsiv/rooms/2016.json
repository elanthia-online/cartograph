    "A few stunted cypress and fir trees edge the trail as it winds up the mountain slope.  Thankfully, the hazardous basalt ruling the landscape to the southwest looks to be giving way to smoother rock underfoot as the elevation rises.  A composition of three large boulders creates a lichen-patterned tableau in the moonlight on the path's northern edge, their arrangement and cant suggesting a group of old men passing time in conversation.",
