  "description": [
    "This room is both shabby and chic, the well-appointed furnishings obviously of high quality, though aged well past their prime.  An indigo circular rug occupies the center of the floor, its high pile irregularly patterned with depressions caused by long-sitting furniture.  Several mismatched tapestry-upholstered chairs are in attendance at the rug's edge, arranged in a semi-circle to face an indigo and grey damask settee with a dark ash wood frame, while the occasional side table interrupts the spaces between."
