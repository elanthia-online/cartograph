    "A long, open-sided shed stands along the south side of Kraken Run.  Within its shelter, craftsmen work tirelessly along rope-walks running the length of the building.  Carrying tremendous bundles of hemp, they slowly move down the walks in teams, feeding out fibers as others work to spin them into yarn.  In front of the residences on the street's north side, spools of cordage and cable are offered for sale by dark-skinned women in bright garb."
