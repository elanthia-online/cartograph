    "Sunlight streams in from the two large windows, brightly illuminating this cheery room.  Painted a sunny yellow, the walls sport several ebonwood-framed landscapes done in oil paint or watercolor.  Smooth, oak floorboards of varying hues lay catercorner to each other in a lovely mosaic design.  Several tables lay host to patrons, while a wooden door leads deeper into the cafe.  Delicious scents linger in the air, as food is being served to the various tables by sure-footed serving staff.",
