    "Ambling down the hill-like incline of the northeastern section of gardens, a small brook lined with silvery-grey limestone pebbles passes beneath the cobalt blue tiles as it travels to the southeast.  In the higher reaches, long stalks of blue irises bend their curving limbs towards the cool waters as if paying homage to its passage.  Nearer at hand, the short-stemmed glory-of-the-snow blossoms dance around the edges of a mossy bank that sprouts indigo woodland crocuses."
