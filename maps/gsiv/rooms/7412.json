    "Crawling up from the floor, a chalky-white human-shaped outline stretches over part of the floor and part of the wall.  A mining shovel is imbedded into the wall around the neck area of the outline.  A roundish splotch of the chalky-white substance lies a few feet away from the outline on the floor."
