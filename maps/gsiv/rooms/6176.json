    "Tattered purple and gold tapestries dot the walls of the lengthy hall, their colors now stained and faded.  A torn red carpet runs along the floor, soggy and covered with patches of mold.  A pair of solid marble pillars forms an arched doorway to the north, their surface carved with images of spiraling grape vines."
