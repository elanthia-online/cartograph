    "A pierced silver lantern hangs from the blue-lacquered wooden ceiling, suspended on an argent chain.  Below, the stone floor is covered with a woven rug, which matches the blue glaes set into one high clerestory window.  A gentian blue velvet chair, a cushioned mistwood settee, and a small table set with a vase of orchids form a conversation triangle in the middle of the room."
