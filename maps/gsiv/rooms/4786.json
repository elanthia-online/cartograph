  "description": [
    "The wind sweeps through the landscape, bringing a slight chill to an otherwise pleasant atmosphere.  The sugar pines and spruces bend slightly in the wind, only to straighten at the breeze's abatement.  Cones hang from the undersides of the upper branches, nature's ornaments on the tough evergreens, and the occasional dead needle drifts lazily toward the ground, spinning and swaying back and forth before finally coming to rest."
