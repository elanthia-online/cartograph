    "Sunlight streams into the back of the booth through a cracked, but still beautiful, stained glass window depicting the various symbols of Liabo.  The multitude of colors cast garish shadows over the dusty shelves and trunks that fill this narrow room.  Atop one overturned chest rests a dented pewter jewelry box, its hinges forced open and lid hanging askew.",
    "A single, guttering candle casts its feeble light around the cluttered, narrow booth.  Garishly colored shadows dance in the flickering light reflected from the stained glass window depicting the various symbols of Liabo.  Atop one overturned chest rests a dented pewter jewelry box, its hinges forced open and lid hanging askew."
