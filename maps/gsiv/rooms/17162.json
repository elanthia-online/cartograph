    "Neatly stacked crates abut the stone walls, partially hidden beneath folded, vibrant linen throws.  Nary a speck of dust can be found, despite the plethora of stored items in this room.  Several tables have been conveniently arranged in a row, far across the room from a small curtained archway."
