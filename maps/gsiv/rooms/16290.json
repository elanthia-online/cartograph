  "description": [
    "The tunnel branches in several directions, its juncture marked by a circular stone set into the floor, its surface masterfully carved.  It depicts the heavens above-ground, constellations and moons rendered with tiny crystal chips inset into the rock.  Somewhere nearby, burning incense adds its exotic flavor to the air."
