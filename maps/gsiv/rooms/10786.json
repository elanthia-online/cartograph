    "Even the passage of unknown years has not erased the sharp scent of burnt wood from this low, cramped hollow within the ancient stump.  The wooden walls of this tiny chamber have been ravaged by heat and stained by the thick smoke of the lightning-induced fire which tore the oak asunder and obliterated its uppermost reaches.  Dim light filters through two gouge-like openings in the old trunk, creating a passageway to another area of the woods."
