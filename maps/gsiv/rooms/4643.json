  "description": [
    "Nestled beneath the peacefully spreading branches of several tanik trees is a charming, fel-gabled edifice.  Set in the elegant bay window, a lone candle burns and an inviting soft light spills forth from the opened window.  A wishing well, affixed with a polished plaque set in its center stands not far off from the building.  Trumpet-shaped purple blossoms of mournblooms snake along the lip of the wishing well and vines of creeping clematis drape down the sides.",

Glimpsed from the open bay window, a set of ivory brocade drapes billow on a soft breeze.  A wishing well, affixed with a polished plaque set at its center stands not far off from the building.  Trumpet-shaped purple blossoms of mournblooms snake along the lip of the wishing well and vines of creeping clematis drape down the sides."
