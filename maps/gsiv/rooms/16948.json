    "Frosted glaes sconces provide a warm glow throughout the lounge, and a soft scarlet carpet lines the floor from wall to wall.  Slanted across the room's center is a giant upholstered L-shaped couch that faces a black marble bar.  Behind the bar is a large golden plaque.  Polished to a high sheen, an ebonwood piano stands to one side waiting to be played.  Sculpted gargoyles and griffins wind across a black marble fireplace.  Twisted blue steel winds into the shape of a stand near the fireplace."
