    "A long terrace snakes around the side of the cliff to the west.  Light blue ice plant mixed with dark green ivy trails down the northern slope.  To the south the ground appears rather unsafe, large chunks of it missing, perhaps now down in the canal directly below.  Several eucalyptus trees anchor the remaining edges of the plateau.  Various forms of exercise equipment reside in several sections, and two pepper trees stand a short distance away with a leather table resting under each."
