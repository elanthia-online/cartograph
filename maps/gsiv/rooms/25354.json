  "description": [
    "A whimsically decorated dollhouse, far too large to be meant for toys alone, sits in the shade of a gracefully draping willow.  A white-pebbled walkway leads toward an open door, and artistically painted shutters hug the pale blue clapboard siding.  The roofing is scalloped clay tiles, the color of gingerbread, with a feathering of white paint along the gables.  Nearby is a blue-bordered privy, tucked discreetly along a small path."
