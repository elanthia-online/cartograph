    "The silence of road is broken by the occasional creaking of the dilapidated guard tower standing watch to the north and east paths.  The structure sways slightly in the wind, the once-reinforced wooden supports splintered across the beams, dried stripes of stygian and crimson trailing downwards towards piles of rusted armor."
