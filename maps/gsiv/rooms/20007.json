  "description": [
    "This narrow passage, which is reasonably well lit by large amounts of the glowing moss, undulates slightly and seems to run a considerable distance in a north-south direction.  The sound of dripping water can be heard to the north while the oddly out of place smell of straw or hay comes from the south."
