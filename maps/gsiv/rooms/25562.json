    "At this end of the passage, a single torch aids the traverse from total darkness and around the small piles of dirt.  Brushing past, a small rat scurries along the floor and disappears into a small hole in the nearby wall.  The shiny carapace of a cockroach glimmers in the subdued light as it makes its way towards a more damp location."
