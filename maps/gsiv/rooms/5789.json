  "description": [
    "Free of stalactites and worn smooth by water, the ceiling of the passage lowers dramatically to the northeast. Luminous insects cast an intermittent dim yellow light on the oppressively low rock, the creatures' movements erratic in the stronger and somewhat fresher current of air coming from the northeast."
