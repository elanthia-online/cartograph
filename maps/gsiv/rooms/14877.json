  "description": [
    "The garden is walled in by a tall green hedge that has been carefully maintained to a crisp, squared-off trim.  Beds on either side of the arch are filled with an impressive display of wildflowers.  At the front are low ground creepers with tiny purple-blue flowers, and in the back are the tall spears of foxglove and fireweed.  A low wrought-iron border keeps visitors on the crushed gravel path and out of the flowers."
