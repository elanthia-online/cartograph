  "description": [
    "Pallid moonlight streams through a bamboo trellis replete with blue crown passion flower vines wound around the engraved posts.  Neatly tended beds of dendrobium orchids flank a short walkway lined with crushed coral.  A small white cottage with peach-tinged eaves sits at the end of the path, a wreath of dried protea hangs from the blue-washed door.  Encircling the rear of the lush property is a smooth teakwood fence festooned with dainty garlands of hibiscus."
