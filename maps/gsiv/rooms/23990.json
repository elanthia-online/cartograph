    "Small pennants edged in gold threading flutter against a light breeze and create a rhythmic flapping sound that echoes off the haon-planked walls.  A wooden barrel is placed adjacent to a long counter that displays a ceramic bowl surrounded by a circlet of fresh wildflowers.  Fresh amaranth and blue violets lay scattered across the floor."
