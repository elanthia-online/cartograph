  "description": [
    "Massive blued steel double doors have been ornately carved with a border of rolling waves, and a bas-relief of various sea shells and other small sea creatures adorn their surfaces.  In the topmost panel of each door, a cresting silver dolphin emerges from a wave.  Soft candlelight draws the focus inside the temple, towards the dimly-lit foyer."
