    "Surrounded by a palisade of roughly hewn logs, the compound is simple with very little ornamentation.  An inverted wooden ship rests within the center of the manicured lawn, while a very large mast rises out of the western grasses.  A crushed seashell path provides clearly defined track between gates and the embassy, its edges flanked by torches that are supported by incredibly tall posts."
