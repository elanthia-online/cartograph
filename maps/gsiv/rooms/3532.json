    "A pale white marble arch breaks the rigid greenery of a thick hedgerow.  The lovely arch is an open invitation to wander the cobbled path leading deeper into its interior.  An engraved mithril sign hangs from one side of the arch.",
    "A soot stained marble arch stands amid a burned hedgerow, and the acrid smell of burnt shrubbery hangs in the air.  A broken mithril sign hangs from a single chain from one side of the arch, swinging in the breeze.  Workers dash about, some pulling up destroyed plants and replanting new ones, while others clean everything with buckets of soap and water.",

    "A white marble arch breaks the rigid greenery of a thick hedgerow.  It opens up to a cobbled path surrounded by marble columns and flower-laden vines and creepers.  An engraved mithril sign hangs from the arch's peak."
