    "A row of three iron-barred cells, one next to the other, line the western wall.  Across from the cells is a table holding a whip and a few scattered shackles.  Dark spots on the cold stone floor appear to be smears of dried blood.  Faint light spills into the area from the top of a narrow staircase."
