    "Narrow ebonwood planks line the interior walls and ceiling of this small wagon boxcar, either wall lined with a row of mannequins.  Three black iron lanterns hang overhead with glowing viridian soulstones clustered inside of their curved tines that cast a dark green light and thick shadows across the walls."
