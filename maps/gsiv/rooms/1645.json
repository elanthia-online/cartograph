    "The trail bends around a stubby promontory which gives a wide view of the lake.  Moonlight sparkles off the water like pearls.  A gentle breeze caresses your cheek.  On the far bank of the lake, barely visible in the moonlight, is a small group of buildings standing beside a field of sunflowers.",
    "The trail bends around a stubby promontory which gives a wide view of the lake.  Sunlight sparkles off the water like diamonds.  A gentle breeze caresses your cheek.  On the far bank of the lake, barely visible against the glare of the sun, is a small group of buildings standing beside a field of sunflowers."
