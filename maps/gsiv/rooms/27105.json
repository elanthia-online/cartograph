    "Continuing its southern journey through the congested trees and vegetation of the jungle, the natural stream of the river cuts through the rich soil with ease.  Giant water lilies float passively within the current, and the muted amethyst blooms of water hyacinths flourish in the cradled protection of ribbed water lettuce leaves.  Large stands of bamboo cluster along the banks on either side in thick clumps of grassy reeds."
