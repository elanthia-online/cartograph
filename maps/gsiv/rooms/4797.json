    "A warm fog envelops the area.  Visibility is reduced to a few yards.  The trees all around display a wet sheen on their trunks, and droplets of water slide down their branches and drip from their leaves.  Footing is mushy at best when off the road and slick when on the road.  As the road is heaved and buckled from years of plant growth, walking on the road is nearly as perilous as venturing off of it.  Fortunately, the cobblestones of the road are readily apparent, running east and south."
