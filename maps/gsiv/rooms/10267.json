    "The brick path ends in front of a tiny wooden structure constructed of latticework panels.  The red paving stones surrounding the building are imprinted with fanciful representations of flowers and herbs.  A low wall running from north to south turns and continues in a westerly direction, creating a cozy sun-warmed corner in this part of the field.",
