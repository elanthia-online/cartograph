    "The walls of this cozy room are shrouded in midnight blue gossamer.  Swaths of dove grey silk line the ceiling, drifting down into the corners of the room.  A low brass stand placed near the large bed holds a porcelain incense burner.   Against the opposite wall is a small, crow-footed table on which rests a crystal ball.  Candles, thoughtfully placed throughout the room, cast a soft and exotic glow."
