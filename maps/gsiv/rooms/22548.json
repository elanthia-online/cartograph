    "Dark purple wooden panels line the walls of the small wagon, lavishly adorned with drapes of thick black velvet.  A silk-lined plush fur rug lines the polished oak floor, and a small fireplace has been inset into the rear wall, its applewood logs crackling softly.  A set of two gold and bronze pegs hold a selection of merchandise."
