    "Clean wood shavings cover the floor of this one room building and several mounds of dried grass line the back wall.   The cozy scent of oak, modwir and grass wars with a faint underlying smell of goat.  An oak bucket rests next to a milking stool in one corner of the room and a watering trough and feed bin in the other."
