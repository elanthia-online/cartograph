    "The room is comfortably furnished and generous in size, with floors of polished oak and large windows that bathe the room in moonlight.  Several leather chairs and end tables have been casually arranged in small groups around the room, and a dark wood-paneled bar rests along a wall.  An imposing stone fireplace stands at the far end of the room, with a carved scarlet-plumed owl perched on the mantel and the Greystorm coat of arms hanging from a tapestry above.  Two overstuffed cognac leather armchairs sit angled before a bear skin rug and the stone hearth.  A curved dark-stained staircase leads up to a rune-inlaid archway.",
