    "Standing in the shadow of the great Guild Hall, you can spy into the eastern ground-floor windows, the closest of which belongs to the Guild Masters' office.  The second floor window has a thick film of dust, appearing neglected.  A converging set of dirt footpaths scar the plush, grassy lawn, leading east to the East Lawn and woodshed, west to the courtyard center and south to other parts of the courtyard."
