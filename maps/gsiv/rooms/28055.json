    "Resembling the interior of an apothecary, the cramped tent room is filled with small and large jars arranged on bookcases of varying heights and widths.  A single lantern hangs from the central post to provide ample illumination for a desk that is covered with implements used for painting and polishing.  Heavy vellum certificates fill a square reed basket that rests amid the various crafting tools upon the desk."
