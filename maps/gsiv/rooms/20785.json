    "The soft golden hue of a linden door is matched by the linden panels that cover the lower half of the walls, while a pale ivory paint colors the top half.  Several ensconced torches hang at even intervals, just above the divide in color.  The molding is finely carved with swirls and eddies, each groove inlaid with fiery scarlet and deep crimson gems, which catch the light to resemble liquid lava.  A sturdy linden desk and chair set stands opposite a wide glass-paned window, while a black-framed painting hangs directly above."
