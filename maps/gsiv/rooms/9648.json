    "Despite the spaciousness of this circular refectory, the air feels close and thick with the odor of past meals.  Trestle tables bear wine stains and other flaws from less recognizable sources.  Candles in etched red glass holders cast a ruddy, yet somehow unsavory light on the surrounding tapestries."
