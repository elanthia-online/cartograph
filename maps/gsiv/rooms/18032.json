    "Aged copper roofs create a striking difference with most of the rest of the Trace, the multi-shades of green creating an odd cast in the ice sheathing them.  To the southeast, a large mithril fountain billows steam into the air, marking it as a major heat source.  The fountain attracts visitors from all over to marvel at its geothermal waters as well as its beautiful silvery and golden construction."
