  "description": [
    "Both sides of the road are filled with two-story, half-timbered buildings.  A few of the second floor windows stand open to the cool night air, but most are shuttered.  A large, wooden wedge of Mestanir Gold cheese hangs above one of the street level doors that appears to still be open at this time of night."
