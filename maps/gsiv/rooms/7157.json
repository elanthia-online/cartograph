    "The stream disappears into a deep sink hole here.  The sound of rushing water and the cloud of fine spray is invigorating and relaxing.  You pause for a moment to look at the sink hole more closely.  It seems wider and deeper than you recall it being.  There are signs of fresh excavations around the opening."
