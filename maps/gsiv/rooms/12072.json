    "A dark granite rock sprawls across the shore and into the water like an enormous beached whale, blocking all passage to the east.  Shattered shells of freshwater mollusks and crayfish litter the nooks and crannies up the sides of the rock, bleached white by the sun and gleaming against the darker background of the stone."
