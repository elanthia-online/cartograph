    "The noise out here from the two waterfalls is almost overwhelming, but this area is actually sheltered by a coral stone overhang that takes up almost the whole roof.  The smaller fall crashes directly into a marble basin set into the coral stone, the overflow splashing on towards a pool below.   From here, you can also see a glass tunnel of sorts that appears to lead away from the house under the larger fall, which is an opaque white wall of water."
