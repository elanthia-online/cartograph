    "Large mango trees grow along the sides of the slow moving river, their branches hanging heavily toward the water below.  Leafy green ferns crowd around the trees, thick and abundant along the banks.  Several flowering plants add color to the waterway, each blossom a bright spot.  A faint scent of salt air drifts from the east, giving hint to the unseen ocean."
