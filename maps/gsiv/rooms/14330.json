    "A couple large rugs woven in shades of light and dark crimson have been placed carefully to overlap most of the oak floors in this room.  A dark hallway can be seen heading off to the northeast, while the sounds of an industrious kitchen can be quite audibly heard coming from the southeast.  Serving wenches wander the room, carrying trays of food and drink to various patrons at nearby tables."
