    "[Underground Cavern, Chamber]"

  "description": [
    "Affecting the appearance of a subterranean cathedral, the middling cavern chamber is supported by three natural columns and surrounded by intricate speleothem draperies.  Several of the formations partition an array of cases, opposite a smooth fused bone cabinet and an expansively long worktable.  Suspended over a glass terranium, an unusually subdued fire elemental is encased in a glass-like cube hanging from a stalactite.  Small motes of ghostly white light flicker in and out of existence, as if not able to maintain their glow here."
