    "A midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is a white marble shelf on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
