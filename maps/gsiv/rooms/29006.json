    "Barred doors and high walls prevent passage deeper into the warehouse, which lends the entry a cramped feeling as the floor space is narrow and the ceiling is low.  A small wooden desk with a high-backed wooden chair behind it sits to one side of the entry, while large placards display the various types of work the shop offers for a ship's cargo hold.  Despite the small size, or perhaps because of it, the shop's single lantern provides a bright and cheery illumination."
