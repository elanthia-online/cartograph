    "A large well rests in the middle of this cobblestone square, a raised thatched roof sitting lopsidedly atop it.  Grasses and flowers poke up through the cobbles around the well, a few butterflies flitting lazily around them.  A few small trees have been planted on two sides of the square, long meadow grasses rising up around them.",
    "A large well rests in the middle of this cobblestone square, a raised thatched roof sitting lopsidedly atop it.  Lanterns hang from poles circle the square, providing enough light to make it quite bright here.  A few small trees have been planted on two sides of the square, long meadow grasses rising up around them."
