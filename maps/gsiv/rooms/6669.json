    "Silence pervades this section of the hallway -- not even the lit torches standing to either side of the polished maoral double doors dare crackle to break it.  The light cast by the torches throws dancing shadows upon the walls of rough stone and the carpet of tightly-woven spidersilk.  The faceted crystal globe hanging from the ceiling here is devoid of any light at all."
