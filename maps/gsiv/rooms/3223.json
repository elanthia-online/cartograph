    "From the simple design and sheer number of closely set wooden houses, it appears that this is a residential area for the neighborhood's working class.  A number of houses have oiled parchment tacked over their windows, as though to block any external light from disturbing the inhabitants.  A dim lantern hanging from one of the houses illuminates its front steps and casts a pale pool of light into the street.",
