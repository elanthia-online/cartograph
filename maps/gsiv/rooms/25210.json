  "description": [
    "The narrow passageway ends abruptly, the walls stretching out to create a yawning, expansive room.  A large lake spreads through the darkness of the cavern, the sounds of lapping water echoing from the distance belying the true size of the chamber.  A faint mist rises from the glassy surface of the lake, the fluctuating miasma holding the foul scent of rot as it trails along the ground."
