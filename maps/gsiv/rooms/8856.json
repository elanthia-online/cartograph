    "Many toys in various stages of repair spill out from a large stamped tin chest to colonize the polished floor.  The long vertical planks of the wall are painted in an alternating rainbow of primary colors, with some additional charcoal decoration in the lowest portion.  Stacked on a little oak table are several sheets of parchment and a selection of drawing tools."
