    "In the center of the cavern is a bubbling mineral pond surrounded by multitudes of cultivated flora flourishing from its nutrient-rich waters.  As the plants grow, their shoots and roots are carefully pruned and used to decorate the stone troughs that border the walking paths.  Raked sand beds and man-made waterfalls complete the miniature landscape."
