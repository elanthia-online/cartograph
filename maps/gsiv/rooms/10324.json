    "Thick Loenthran carpets in shimmering hues of aubergine, olive and amber cover the smooth stone floors, adding warmth and luxury to the chamber.  A vaulted ceiling, painted with a scene of ancient battle, soars overhead.  Small beams of colored light refracting through the panes of stained glaes windows arc across the otherwise undecorated ivory limestone walls."
