    "A large wooden tub sits overturned in the center of the room.  The room is filled with the nauseatingly cloying scent of the soap rotting on the floor mixed with the scent of oxidizing copper from the dented boiler leaning against one wall.  You step carefully, attempting to avoid the slick spots, so as not to fall, or track the soap slime out on your feet."
