    "A strange feeling of timelessness is evident here, moreso than in the rest of the observatory.  The air feels almost stagnant, and very little dust rises as it is disturbed by movement in the room.  Silent and still, a richly robed figure lies in a seemingly quiet slumber on the room's lone bed.  The figure appears as ageless as the rest of the place, but her skin is dull and grey, and she does not appear to breathe."
