    "Hoofprints, pawprints, and the smoothed-dirt striations from large dragging tails show the path taken by native inhabitants fleeing the scorched landscape of the former festival grounds.  The trail heads due east, past burnt vegetation and a few rotting carcasses, before opening up near the eastern walkway, partially submerged in the fetid, black waters of the swamp."
