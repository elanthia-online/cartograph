    "Off the cobblestone lane, a meandering path cuts through a group of houses to a modest, grey stone chapel.  Winged gargoyles perched on the roof stare down at a scrubby cemetary in the rear surrounded by overgrown hedges.  The doors to the chapel are open wide, offering a glimpse of an overturned altar inside."
