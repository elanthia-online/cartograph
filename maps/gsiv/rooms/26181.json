    "Scribbled across the top of the table are dozens of hastily laid out diagrams and crudely drawn maps of the surrounding beaches.  The drawings are sometimes drawn so closely together as to create a chaotic hodge-podge of lines that are almost unrecognizable as maps.  Bold X's here and there mark the spot for would-be treasure hunters."
