    "Before you stands the only building in the entire caravansary that appears to have been built to last.  The grey slate roof and half-timber construction give this two-story hall a look of permanence.  Hanging above the door, a brightly painted sign of a fully laden wagon indicates that the Mercantylers' Guild is housed here."
