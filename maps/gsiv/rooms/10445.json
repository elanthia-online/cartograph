    "A worn path through the grassy sward follows the inner wall in front of a couple canvas-covered merchant stands that have been set up under its shadow.  The merchants hawk their wares to passing shoppers and the occasional guardsman who wander past.",
    "Illuminated by the flickering torches that have been placed throughout the area, a path through the grassy sward can be easily seen along with a couple canvas-covered merchant stands that have been set up near the massive stone inner wall.  The merchants hawk their wares to passing shoppers and the occasional guardsman who wander past."
