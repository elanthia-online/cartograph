    "A slight mist fills the air here and is accompanied by the rushing sound of the nearby waterfall.  The rough bark on the tree log cross-section steps provides sturdy footing for any that try to navigate the narrow, switchbacking mountain trail.  Trees, grass, and other lush flora glisten and thrive in the gentle dampness here, nearly obscuring an overgrown path that leads down to the bottom of the gorge."
