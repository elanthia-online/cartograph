  "description": [
    "This upper room of the tower is a menagerie of alchemical odds and ends that readily catch and reflect the flickering light of the oil lamps scattered about.  Pristinely clean glass beakers sit lined according to size on top of the hutch mounted on the worktable against the far wall.  Various vials and ampoules are seated in the nooks of the hutch alongside several glass droppers.  On the wall opposite the worktable are some shelves covered in a drape of argent velvet with a fringe of crystalline glass beads."
