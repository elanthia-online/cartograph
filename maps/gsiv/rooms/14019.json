    "A wide platform, free of railings or restraints, has been erected among the strong branches of this tree.  A few soft sage linen cushions are tossed casually about the smooth surface, and layers of vibrant green leaves smattered with tiny white flowers provide the only walls.  Rays of moonlight slip through the twisting limbs, causing patterns of light to dance across the area with the slightest breeze.",
