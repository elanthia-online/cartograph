  "description": [
    "A large braided rug covers most of the hardwood floor.  Blue muslin curtains hang on either side of the window, draped back by small decorative hooks.  A small carved footstool, looking more like a toy than a piece of furniture, rests against the end of the Giantman-sized bed.  An over-sized armoire nearly fills the opposite side of the room."
