  "description": [
    "The canyon makes a sweeping turn as its ice load slowly descends from east to southwest.  The wind has driven most of the snow up against the northwestern side of the canyon, exposing the surface of the glacier.  It is not smooth and slick, but rather pitted and scarred by the effects of the wind driving both snow and dirt particles across its surface.  The ice is milky, with dirt, rocks and other debris trapped within its frigid grasp."
