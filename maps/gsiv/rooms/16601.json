    "A woven floral tapestry hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  An ornate bottled ship sits in one corner of a swirled sea glass floor.  There is some carved haon pegs on one side of the shop and a wide knotted oak counter on the other."
