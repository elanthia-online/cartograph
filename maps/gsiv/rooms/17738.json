    "The octagonal patio is paved with dark riverstones and separated from a surrounding field of wildflowers by a thin cast iron railing.  A polished wood workbench rests in the center of the patio, while a weathered dark wood cabinet sits against the railing, covered in detailed carvings of various perched and flying native birds.  Beyond the railing, a single large oak tree grows in the nearby field, offering a large shadowy expanse beneath it to rest.",
