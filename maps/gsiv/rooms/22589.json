    "[Abandoned Church, Undercroft]"

  "description": [
    "Circular stone walls covered in mold and mildew enclose the undercroft, each bearing a carved ledge.  Upon the ledges, sarcophagi rest, though their lids are removed, and whatever rested within has been plundered.  Leading up to the chancel, a torch-lined granite stairwell is the only source of light."
