    "Beams of every kind of wood sustain the weight of the faded black canvas.  Patched in several places, the canvas has been converted into the walls and ceiling of the abundant enclosure.  Hanging from the ridgepole is a large metal sign.  Lanterns suspended from the beams above furnish the area with ample lighting.  Numerous stands, on top of the faded burgundy rug covering the dilapidated floor, form a circle in the center of the room displaying the wares."
