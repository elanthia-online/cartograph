    "Level ground makes the path more defined as the snow has been tamped down to create a firm base.  Constant traffic packs the soft powder into a thick cushion, slightly slippery from the daily melting and nightly refreezing at the edge of the glacier.  Spidery tracings of snow are plastered along the stone wall guarding the town, a result of wind kicking up the drifts."
