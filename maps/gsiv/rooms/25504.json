  "description": [
    "Daylight filters in through an ornate red bronze hatch in the ceiling, the ostentatious bronzework at odds with the simple, elegant care that has gone in to the stone-colored wood of the deck and paneled walls.  A spiraling stairway ascends up toward light and open sky.  Faint metallic whistling echoes down through the aperture, muted by distance so that it almost sounds like the music of woodwinds."
