  "description": [
    "Rotting vegetation litters the thin strip of dry land that lies in the distance to the west.  A curious pile of bones rests amidst the decay, bleached by extended exposure to the sun.  An occasional *pop* can be heard, as swamp gas bubbles up through the quagmire, leaving in its wake a putrid and nauseating odor."
