    "The path meanders through the dignified old birches.  Claw marks gouge the bark of one large tree.  Wood sage and pink fireweed grow thickly between the trees.  The air is redolent with the scent of wild sage.  Below, down a stony path, can be seen the distinctive blue-green of young tanik trees."
