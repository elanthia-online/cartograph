  "description": [
    "Covered with palm fronds that are strapped together with thick cords of vines, the hive-shaped hut has no true walls, instead supported by several thick tree trunks rising up from holes in the floor to the roof.  The ground is blanketed in woven strips of red-dyed cloth layered one atop another, creating a dry surface.  Stacked haphazardly all over the hut, crudely formed clay pots hold various materials, from dried scalps to hollowed-out skulls."
