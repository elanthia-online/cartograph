  "description": [
    "Relentless pounding fury fills this pool at the basin of Archer Falls.  Cooling spray can be felt even at the farthest reach this close to the trail, the direct result of the arching white cascade.  A jutting ledge at the top of the falls forces the roaring water to fan out, extending like a well-tuned bow for which it has been named.  A small rock shelf from a parallel cliff wall can be reached in a short climb, promising a magnificent view."
