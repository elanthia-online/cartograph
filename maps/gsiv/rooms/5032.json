    "A tiny stream, no more than a trickle of muddy rainwater, emerges from the tall grass and drips over the sheer edge of the ravine.  Footprints of various denizens of the grasslands and the marks of many a struggle are visible in the muddy ground near the lifegiving water, and a few flecks of what appears to be blood form dark patches on the thick blades of grass.",
