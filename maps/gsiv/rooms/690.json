    "The impenetrable stone facade of a guild hall looms above, dwarfed only by BriarStone Keep to the west and the spire of a belltower soaring above the rooftops to the north.  A small moat encircles the hall, a short wooden bridge spanning its breadth with ease.  A mithglin sign is posted nearby."
