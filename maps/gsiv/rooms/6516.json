    "The road snakes down a hill in lazy curves.  Water run-off has rendered the rocks and ruts into a hazardous obstacle course.  To the northeast, a trail descends toward a lake, which lies in the distance like a flat, grey mirror.  It's curious how the surface of the water seems to absorb light instead of reflect it."
