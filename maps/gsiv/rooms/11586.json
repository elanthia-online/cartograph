    "A long row of leaded glass stern windows looks out at a crazy angle over Maelstrom Bay.  Moonlight streams through the windows, revealing a scene of chaos.  Pillows from the bench locker beneath the windows are scattered across the deck.  Furniture, usually battened down, is strewn about the area.  Charts, crumpled and torn, are spread out on the deck.",
