    "Black walls are lined with windows that are painted over so darkly that it's impossible to see out of them.  Brilliant glowing pink and blue paint marks up the walls in large splashes of color, illuminating a purple-painted archway and a threadbare rug with green hexagonal patterning on it.  A finely carved wooden desk sprawls out in the middle of the hallway, blocking part of the passage."
