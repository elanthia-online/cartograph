    "A chill wind whistles through the night-cloaked pass, its cold fingers prying through even the most heavily bundled clothing.  Seemingly alive with ill-intent, the icy tendrils crave warmth.   Stealing heat from their hapless victims, they howl off with their quickly fading prize into the dark environs of the mountain slopes.",
