    "Sentinel modwirs stand guard over a waterproof canvas and silk structure, their boughs carefully pruned to frame it artfully.  Riverstones surrounded by a well-manicured lawn make a path to its entrance.  Unbound by containers, drifts of amaranth, columbine, delphinium, and hollyhocks show off perfect blooms to passersby."
