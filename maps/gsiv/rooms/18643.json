    "Fitted into place and supported by golden linden wood beams, the ceiling is fashioned from an enormous hemisphere of thick, clear blown glass that allows the sunlight to completely fill the tiny workroom.  Flanking the tunnel-like entry, which is cordoned off by a white Vornavian silk curtain, are a pair of frosted glass lanterns.  A carved golden linden workbench holds a tidy array of alchemy devices, as well as a small copper brazier.",

Flanking the tunnel-like entry, which is cordoned off by a white Vornavian silk curtain, are a pair of softly burning, frosted glass lanterns.  A carved golden linden workbench holds a tidy array of alchemy devices, as well as a small copper brazier."
