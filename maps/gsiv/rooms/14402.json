  "description": [
    "Lit by the unsteady commingling of verdant and opaline light trickling through some colored glass windows set into the western wall, the kitchen is a large chamber bounded by riverstone and honey-hued wood paneling.  The rich, hearty scent of smoke melded with that of roasting boar wafts from a gaping stone-trimmed hearth opposite the windows."
