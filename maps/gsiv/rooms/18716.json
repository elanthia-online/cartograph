    "Set slightly apart from the bustle of activity in this wing, a serviceable iron cauldron stands ready for use by apprentice alchemists, suspended from the massive oak beams overhead by a wrought iron chain.  Below it, coals glow with an orange-red heat, wafting the acrid odor of burning charcoal upwards."
