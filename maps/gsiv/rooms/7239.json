    "This place has been the scene of many a revolting semblance of a feast.  You have trouble holding on to your insides as the horror of what transpired in here sinks in.  A scattering of chairs, benches and old broken tables tells of the terrifying attempts of the sinister celebrants to mock and imitate the ways of their civilized and unsuspecting prey.  At one end of the room is an ancient cabinet that once may have held food.  A numbingly cold breeze flows from that direction."
