    "The walls of this dark and gloomy room are plated with polished obsidian, ghostly reflections dancing across their glossy black surfaces.  Dim light flickers from a tank full of squirming serpentine forms in one corner.  Along one wall is a set of shelves that serves as an apothecary, stocked with numerous bottles and vials of varying shapes and sizes."
