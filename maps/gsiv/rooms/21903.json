    "Wisps of green, yellow and orange smoke drift lazily about the pavilion, all eventually rising to seep through a small opening in the top of the tent.  Two grey canvas walls are nearly concealed by thick wooden shelves, each one sporting a variety of colorful bottles and smoking vials.  In a corner of the tent sits a twitchy-eyed halfling alchemist, coughing and wheezing as he mixes the contents of glowing beakers."
