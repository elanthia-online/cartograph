    "[Potion Platform]"

  "description": [
    "The small platform clings precariously to the side of the canal wall.  A stone stairway leads upward while a wooden stairway slips down into a recessed cavern below.  The wall, the stairways and the canal's waters underneath encompass the platform.  Long, winding orchid vines sporting dark flowers entwine around the platform's railing, and narrow workbenches support bottles, herbs, powders, and ointments piled haphazardly."
