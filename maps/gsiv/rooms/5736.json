    "Giant potted toadstools reflect off the dark waters of a canal in wavering streaks of blue and white.  The rivulet runs toward the cavern wall, disappearing beneath a platform of reinforced steel.  A tiny island, barely more than a rock, houses a life-like statue of a stoic dwarven miner wielding an invar pick."
