    "Blue-speckled sea glass walls rise from a swirled sea glass floor.  Just above a pile of striped throw pillows hangs a curl-edged vellum wall map, and a smooth marble ceiling completes the picture.  A long mistwood counter and a Vornavian silk-lined display case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
