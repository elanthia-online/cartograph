  "description": [
    "Fed by the river winding in from the northwest, the multi-level waterfall shimmers with muted shafts of moonlight that enhances its natural beauty.  The dark water spills forth in a cascade over this plateau to pool up on the next, then empties into a shadowy lagoon below with splashes of water that rise up in misty plumes.  Deep shadows accentuate the darkness of the jungle on the western shore, while the other is open to the night sky as the terrain surrenders to the coastal cliffs."
