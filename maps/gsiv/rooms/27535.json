    "Centered in the room, an oversized rolaren-framed lantern slowly sways above a slightly glossy, dark green floor that, despite the appearance of a tongue-like texture, is actually smooth and sturdy.  A black scaly curtain in the back is flanked on both sides by ironwood tabletops impaled on large, jagged mistwood teeth leading to the front."
