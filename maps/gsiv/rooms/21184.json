    "Scents of garlic and herbs mingle with those of rotten food.  The water flows slowly past piles of food wastes in various states of decay.  A soft click-click in the darkness suggests that the piles are feasts for some.  Rising from a pile of fresh slop, a slippery ladder leads upward to the apparent source."
