  "description": [
    "The cold stone walls of this upper room are broken only by a simple banner bearing the word \"Glory,\" which ripples in the frigid wind coursing through the hole leading through the ceiling to the roof.  A legion of beds stand at attention in the barracks, ready to give comfort to the weary and the wounded.  At the head of the stairway is a large cabinet designed to hold bandages and herbs for the cure of the wounded."
