  "description": [
    "Clumps of rotted straw lie scattered across the decking that stretches from the inner hull to the wide, wrought iron slats of the cell's rusty bars.  Black rings fixed to the walls with thick iron staples are evenly spaced along the bulkhead and fitted with manacles.  The stench filling the cramped space is heavy with mold and decay."
