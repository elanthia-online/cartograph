    "A small spring-fed pool sits in the shade of a haon tree.  Small insects appear to skate across the surface of the water.  Despite the tiny ripples created by the insects, the surface of the water reflects a mirror image of the haon tree.  A granite bench, near the pool, provides a serene place to sit and relax.",
    "A small spring-fed pool sits in the shade of a haon tree.  Small insects appear to skate across the surface of the water, visible in the moonlight.  Despite the tiny ripples created by the insects, the surface of the water reflects a mirror image of the moon and stars above.  A granite bench, near the pool, provides a serene place to sit and relax."
