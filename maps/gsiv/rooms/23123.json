    "[Ancient Preparation Chamber]"

  "description": [
    "Eight oblong sandstone mounds stand about this circular chamber like spokes in a wheel, and heavily verdigrised chunks of bronze protrude from the eroded sand at the head and foot of each mound.  Darkly stained channels carved into the floor run from each mass of sandstone to a deteriorated enamel sump in the room's center, and whatever treatment may once have graced the chamber's walls has been reduced to a grey powder that fills the corner where the floor and walls meet, leaving rough-carved limestone in its place."
