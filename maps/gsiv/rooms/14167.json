    "Alabaster walls crafted of decorative marble provide a short divider that encases the small cobblestone courtyard, secluding it from the rest of the temple's grounds.  Four black marble benches are poised at cardinal points of a compass rose painted in gold upon the ground, and at its center is a pedestal topped with an oversized golden blown-glass orb.  The only plants that mar the stark serenity of the area are flowers left at key points against the decorative walls."
