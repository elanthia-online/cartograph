    "A ring of ash trees circles a small clearing encompassing a pond.  Leaves float upon its mirror-like surface like tiny ships manned with sprites.  Wild thyme crowds the pool's bank, adding perfume to the still air.  At one side stands a bronze sculpture, cast in the form of a selkie emerging from its skin with lithe glory.  The few houses sit demurely within the trees and meld with the surroundings like stones along a river bank."
