    "Lines of rust on the hard stone floor and a few feathers mark where a bed once stood.  A set of polished vaalorn full plate, embossed with the insignia of the Sabrar, stands remarkably untouched by time on a stand just inside the door, a faint glow surrounding it.  Bits of wood give vague hints at the rest of the room's previous furnishings."
