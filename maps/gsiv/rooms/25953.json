    "Splitting the path in two, a massive oak tree provides shade and shelter during the day.  Squirrels chitter overhead, cavorting in the playground of dried leaves and acorns.  A cornucopia wraps around the tree's base, overflowing with offerings themed to the harvest and to the bounty of nature."
