    "The trail rises steeply to a bluff overlooking the river to the east and descends to a small ferry landing visible to the west.  The scent of burning wood mixed with the mouthwatering odor of stew reaches your nostrils, its source most likely the smoke issuing from the chimney below.  The forest presses close, keeping the trail near the river.  The trail is clearly delineated, a long line of ground worn bare by the passing of many feet."
