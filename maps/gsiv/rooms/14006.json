    "A pair of stained glass doors open directly into the garden, where a well-manicured carpet of verdant grass is surrounded by a circle of stately haon trees.  The strong trunks and layered green leaves create a quiet area of insulated serenity.   Moonlight glints on the waters of a perfectly round pond at the center of the area, the surface dotted with glowing white votives.  Daisies sprout at the base of an elaborate polished marble statue.",
