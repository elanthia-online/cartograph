    "A lone rat scampers close to a saucer of milk left out for stray cats near one of the building's closed back doors.  Oil lamps create gargantuan shadows along the walls surrounding this courtyard, as passersby come and go.  Several trumpet vines climb and intertwine along the walls, their brilliant flame-hued blossoms closed into tight buds for the night.",
    "Several scrawny cats crowd around a saucer of milk left out for them near one of the building's closed back doors.  Birds take advantage of the laundry ropes strung overheard, using them as convenient perches, to the distraction of the gathering felines.  Several trumpet vines climb and intertwine along the walls, their showy dark green foliage contrasting with brilliant flame-hued blossoms."
