  "description": [
    "Small portholes spread across the walls of the engine room, each providing a different view of the exterior of the ferry.  Tiny boxes, heavily guarded by robed sailors, are arranged against the wall at the back of the room and generate a strange gurgling, humming sound.  Bright white globes provide the small space with ample illumination."
