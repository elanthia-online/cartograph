    "The broad sweep of the red maple floor is interrupted by a suit of golden armor.  Halfway to the arched ceiling, a vaalorian crested pennant hangs on one of the textured red silk walls.  A iron-bound ebonwood chest and a twisted dark metal rack are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
