    "Tucked against the wall of the building is a small enclosure topped with a tin roof and open on two sides.  Therein sit four stone boxes, all with fires built in them and game turning on spits above.  Tonight's choices appear to be bear, velnalin, salmon, and sausages, offered with unhusked corn cooked directly on the coals.  There is also a distinctive bar, featuring a tub containing a large block of ice.  Shaved ice surrounds the block, and brightly colored drinks occupy a tray close by."
