    "A small, swampy clearing is surrounded by the dense forest on the northern and western sides.  The large branches of the trees along the perimeter create a canopy of leaves above with just patches of moonlight penetrating the foliage.  Hollow logs lie half covered by water and mud, moss and fungi growing from the decay.  Quiet bubbling sounds emanate from the water as frogs and other critters surface out of and dive into the swamp.",
