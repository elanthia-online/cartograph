    "Rising high above the swamp, a corroded green statue surveys the thick undergrowth below and blocks further passage to the north.  Multitudes of saw grasses and brilliant crimson flora wind along the thin, narrow ledge descending to the southwest.  A curtain of vines hangs over the precipice, the sinuous tangles creating a foreboding sound in the faintest of breezes."
