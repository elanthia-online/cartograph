    "Glass mirrors, set at angles to one another, cover the the textured walls nearly to the creamy ceiling, and the off-white marble flooring is touched with hints of gold and grey.  A gleaming staircase of highly polished kakore planks is supported by rigid spirals of bronze piping.  Leading upward to a second story cabin, the entrance is blocked by a thick golden satin cord."
