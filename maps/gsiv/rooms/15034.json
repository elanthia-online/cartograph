    "Mottled grey marble walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above a handblown double-heart bottle hangs a pair of crossed bones, and a pebble textured ceiling completes the picture.  A narrow glass-topped table and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
