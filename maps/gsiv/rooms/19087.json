    "In the back of the upper section of 'tween deck, the light is dimmer, getting less illumination from the open hatch at the aft end of the room.  The bunks along the walls are grouped in sets of four with slated wooden screens dividing them, and a neatly folded square of blanket lies at the foot of each one."
