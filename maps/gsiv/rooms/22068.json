    "Framed in gold, an oval mirror hangs at the end of the hallway, while underneath a crystal vase of flowers rests upon a carved mahogany table.  Twin arcing windows look into the beautiful garden and allow a mixture of floral-tinged scents to fill the air.  A pale silk curtain partially covers a teak archway, the light brown wood shining in contrast to the white walls and marble floor."
