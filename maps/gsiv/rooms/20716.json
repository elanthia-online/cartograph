  "description": [
    "Wrought iron railings shaped into two-toned spirals of light and dark surround this small, rectangular balcony.  White wicker chairs and benches face the garden down below and offer a place to rest under the shady overhang of the villa's roof that protects much of this space from the elements.  Within arm's reach, a lattice rose trellis leans up against the side of the building, the scent of flowers lingering heavily in the air.  Two potted palms flank a pair of glass double doors that stands ajar."
