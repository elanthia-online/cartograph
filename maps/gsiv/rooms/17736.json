    "A weathered dark wood cabinet sets against a thin cast iron railing that separates the octagonal patio from a field of wildflowers.  Set in the center of the riverstone-paved area is a polished wood workbench.  Along the railing, a strand of honeysuckle twirls and weaves and fills the area with a sweet aroma.  Attracted by the scent, several bees buzz back and forth along the blossoms of the colorful vine.",
