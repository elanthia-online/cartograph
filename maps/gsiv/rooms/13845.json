    "You've entered a space which is wedged between two rows of filing cabinets and sectioned off by a heavy brocade curtain.  In it is a simple modwir desk with an elderly clerk sitting behind it, peering over the mounds of paper which surround him.  He snorts to himself once, mutters something under his breath, then returns to work."
