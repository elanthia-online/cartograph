  "description": [
    "A rectangular monir table sits in the middle of the room, surrounded by high-backed padded chairs. Extra chairs have been placed along the wall to provide additional seating if necessary.  The giant head of a black boar has been hung on the wall.  Its beady glass eyes seem to survey the area, while an impressive display of weaponry has been mounted opposite it."
