    "This large and dirty room is covered in a layer of dust and filth everywhere, and the only thing that seems to be untouched is a polished faewood wardrobe.  Some rusty steel hooks hang on the wall in the far back of the room.  The wooden floor is a maze of warped and bent planks, making the exploration of the room a bit unsafe."
