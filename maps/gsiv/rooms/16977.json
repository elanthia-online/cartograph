    "This appealing rest spot sits directly before the steps leading to the Guild Hall door.  A pair of statues watches over the entire courtyard, including the nearby stone benches and bubbling fountain.  The benches invite you to sit and the fountain encourages you to stay.  Several fireflies hover over the fountain, their light reflecting off the clear water below."
