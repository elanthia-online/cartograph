    "Completing its eastward arc, the river once again returns to a generally southerly direction.  Inside the chest-high perimeter wall is a large sward of immaculately-kept grass bordered with grey slate walkways.  Near it, a large armory with a spectacular view of the golden walls of Ta'Vaalor rings with the sound of equipment repair and maintenance."
