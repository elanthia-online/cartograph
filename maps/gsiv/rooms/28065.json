  "description": [
    "Built on a raised platform, this part of the saddlemaker's stall is entirely enclosed by white oak beams, save for a set of five steps leading out.  An intricate system of hooks jutting down from the ceiling suspends, at varied cants and angles, six Finnian style saddles.  Kannalan style saddles hang along a railing near one wall, oppposite a long, horizontal post topped with a row of Minstrel's style saddles.  Scattered throughout the room, lanterns constantly spit tiny flames, their smoke mingling with the scents of white oak and leather."
