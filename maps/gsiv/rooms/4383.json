    "Artful draperies of knotted yarn and bright stone beads festoon the wrought iron archway in the southeast wall.  Hundreds of ribbons and cords hang from gilded hooks in the striated stone walls, enclosing the cavern in a riot of mingled color and texture.  A standing iron brazier occupies the center of the chamber, and the flames that leap from it flare green and blue in turns."
