  "description": [
    "Two tall doric columns of ice mark the gateway to the Behlayr neighborhood, a colorful banner draped between them proclaiming the purported healing qualities of the mithril fountain in the central square.  Silver strands spiral down around the columns, lending a hint of color to their otherwise stark white facades.  The rest of the town stretches out to the north, its chimneys trying to provide some semblance of heat to the inhabitants."
