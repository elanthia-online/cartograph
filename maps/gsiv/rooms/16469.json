    "Painted silk screens are set before a wide driftwood window, blocking the view of the shop from anyone that might peep in from outside.  The walls are the pale blue of the sky, and several colorful plaques set into the painted wood are shaped like indigenous birds.  In the center of the room, tall faenor racks display various female clothing, while a long counter at the back of the room displays those garments not suited for hanging."
