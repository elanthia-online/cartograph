    "The passage opens up here into a large cavern where many supplies are kept.  A row of hooks along one wall hold varying sizes of ropes and several rusted lengths of chain.  Crates of dried meat are stacked neatly to one side and marked with writing, the likes of which you have never seen before.  Timbers line the walls and you hear a creak from time to time as the ceiling settles onto the timbers."
