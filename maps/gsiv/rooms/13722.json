    "Honeysuckle vines dominate this corner of the cloister, although a few tightly closed morning glory vines are visible as well as one pale lavender night-blooming moonflower, its petals drinking in the moonlight.  The branches of an aloeas tree are visible behind the garth-facing columns, its moss green leaves almost black in the night air.  A stunning silver-edged fern, taller than any elf, casts its shadow over the mosaic-inlaid walkway.",
    "Honeysuckle vines dominate this corner of the cloister, although a few bright morning glory vines push through from the west.  The branches of an aloeas tree are visible behind the garth-facing columns, sunlight filtering through its moss green leaves to dapple the mosaic-inlaid walkway.  In the back corner, an amber-hued sandstone pot holds a stunning silver-edged fern grown with such care that its height exceeds anything an elf could attain."
