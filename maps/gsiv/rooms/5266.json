    "High above, the green canopy of pine grows thin, allowing light to stream through the woods and brighten the path here.  The soft glow illuminates the woods, and moonlight leaks through to shine on rocks and bushes off to the side of the path.  Toads lounge on larger rocks, flicking out tongues to catch the occasional insect buzzing past.",

The green glow warms the woods, and direct sunlight leaks through to shine on rocks and bushes off to the side of the path.  Lizards sun themselves on larger rocks, flicking out tongues to catch the occasional insect buzzing past."
