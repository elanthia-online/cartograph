    "A small tributary stream meanders slowly across the forest floor on its way eastward into the Locksmehr River.  The water is a dark color and exudes a metallic odor.  Small insects skitter across the surface of the stream, avoiding the large maple leaves that attempt to completely cover the trickling waters.  Although the ground is mushy at this point, someone has strategically placed stones to create a dry crossing.",
