    "This narrow spartan room contains all the basics of sleeping quarters, but only the basics.  A sleeping cot sits against one wall, while a line of hooks run along the opposite wall under a plain wood shelf.  You can hear noise from the tavern below and from people tramping the stairs outside.",
    "The light cotton window curtains are drawn open allowing you to look out from this room to the bazaar area outside the inn.  A large, comfortable-looking bed is flanked on one side by a nightside, on the other by a wardrobe closet.  Under the window is a small padded bench."
