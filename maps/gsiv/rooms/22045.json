    "Polished oak floors with an inlaid teak border add to the tranquility and elegance of the room.  Centered in the room is a large stone basin with fragrant white water lilies floating in crystal clear water.  Delicate white sheer drapes hang down from an elaborately carved teak canopy that spans the ceiling.  Meditation mats circle the water basin, and tiny crystal prisms hang at different heights from the canopy."
