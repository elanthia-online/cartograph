    "Branches of bright green vine maples rise up from either side of the trail, arcing overhead and meeting in the middle to form a private bower.  Dappled moonlight filters through the leaves, lighting the surroundings in a soft silvery blue.  A cedar bench provides a place for rest or private reflection.",
