    "A tall, thick tree to the southwest of the path has collapsed and leans across the path on the incline.  The tree is long dead, bereft of roots and leaves, but is wedged tightly in a rock outcropping in the incline.  The tree does not block the path, but looms overhead as travelers pass beneath."
