    "Walls of boxes labeled \"Picks\" and \"Lantern Parts\" are piled three and four high, making a corridor that leads north and west.  The crates have certainly seen better days, as their boards are warping and their corners are coming apart.  A sagging arch opens in the south wall, away from the warehouse proper."
