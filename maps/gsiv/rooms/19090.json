  "description": [
    "In lieu of wall coverings, the cabin is festooned with hanging panels of multicolored feathers.  Here and there a bit of mahogany peeks out in the form of a frame around a doorway or a porthole, but for the most part the room is a riot of avian color.  Several metal containers rest on the floor, almost blocking access to a narrow arch."
