    "This room branches off into several different directions but appears to be the central location to this tunnel.  A large table dominates the room, with many stools arranged along the outside for the inhabitants to sit while they dine.  A large firepit ringed with stones is off to one side of the room.  It looks as if the area has seen a lot of use recently, and the odor of burnt flesh lingers in the air."
