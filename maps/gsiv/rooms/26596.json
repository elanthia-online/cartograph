    "More vein-like fissures splay along the limestone walls, the ceiling pierced by disfigured stalactites like sharpened fangs threatening to rip apart a web-covered decline across the dusty floor below.  A dislodged stalactite lays shattered above a yellowed skull of dubious origin, a furry spider weaving an intricate web within its hollow eyesockets."
