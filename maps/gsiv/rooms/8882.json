    "A quiet lily-covered pond is surrounded by a bed of wildflowers and exotic groundcover.  An occasional golden fin breaks the surface sending tiny ripples across the surface, making the pads undulate slowly on the top of the water.  Small bees buzz busily from flower to flower, then ferrying it back to their hive high up in the trees."
