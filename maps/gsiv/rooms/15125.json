    "Mottled grey marble walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above a bronzed drake sculpture hangs a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry, and a vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  An oval-shaped speckled marble counter and an engraved copper bin stand side by side in the middle of the room."
