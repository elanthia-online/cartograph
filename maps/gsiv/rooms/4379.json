    "A single wrought-iron rack stands in the middle of this room, while an oak display counter has been set against one wall.  A rather elaborate mithril fixture hangs from the ceiling, holding dozens of burning candles.  The otherwise smooth stone floor is covered by a pure white rabbit fur rug."
