    "This freshly scrubbed cedar-planked table sits amidst high-backed chairs carved with leaves.  A small earthenware vase rests in the middle, overflowing with eucalyptus sprigs.  The rich scent of the cedar blends with the herbal fragrance of the eucalyptus, bringing the lush scent of an overgrown forest to the indoors."
