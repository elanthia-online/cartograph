    "Walls of dark-hued ice ascend in a curving arc to form a narrow circular chamber, the sunlight filtering through in fractured, hazy waves.  A dark red altar stands near one of the walls, a quietly menacing statue carved out of the surroundings sitting behind it.  Faint shadows play across the thick ice around the statue, distorted and blurred by the crystalline facets, though at times the darkness resembles something vaguely feline in form.",

A dark red altar stands near one of the walls, a quietly menacing statue carved out of the surroundings sitting behind it.  Faint twinges of light emanate from the thick ice around the statue, distorted slightly by the crystalline facets, though at times the sparkles resemble a luminous slitted eye."
