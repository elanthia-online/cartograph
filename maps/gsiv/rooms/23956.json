    "Situated in a circle, tall poles hold aloft a canopy of ropes laden with vibrant paper-shaded lanterns that sway gently in the breeze as it rolls off the nearby river.  Outside of the circle, a small band of string and pipe players create lively tunes for dancing, as onlookers gather near to hear the music.",
    "Situated in a circle, tall poles hold aloft a canopy of ropes laden with vibrant paper-shaded lanterns to create a picturesque scene backed by the gentle whisper of the river.  Outside of the circle, a small band of string and pipe players weave together song after song, while on the other side of the Tempest fireworks burst into the sky, one colorful blossom after another."
