    "A staircase can be seen off to the south end of the polished mahogany hallway.  Sporadic bursts of laughter and raucous singing can be heard coming from somewhere below.  A quick glance over the oak railing shows a few people wandering aimlessly from place to place.  A wide oak door has been set into the west wall where the hallway makes a turn to the northeast."
