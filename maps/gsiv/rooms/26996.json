    "Scattered starlight slips across the translucent dome of arcane energy that protects the surface of Liabo from the void of space, its soft incandescence helping to dispel the chill in the air.  Distant nebulas paint a purple, pink, and saffron smudge across the eastern sky, while small meteorites become streaks of fire in the north.  Upon the unyielding, lunar stone, a glowing glass-lined ring fills the air with a gentle hum."
