  "description": [
    "Shrouded in the shadow of the two story house on one side and the dense foliage of the boxwood hedge on the other three, the garden is lit only by the night sky.  Water gurgles from the top of the rounded mass that is the fountain at the garden's center, and ripples dimly break the jet surface of the basin's water that encircle its base.  A narrow set of steps climbs from the garden to the balcony, hugging the house's west wall."
