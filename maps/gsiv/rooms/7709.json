    "The timbers creak with the weight of the ruin above, almost threatening to collapse what remains of the old storage area.  Bits of cloth and other small remainders of the departed occupants lie mixed in with splinters of timber fallen from the rotting ceiling.  A dark iron oil lamp is affixed to the low ceiling, its flame long extinguished."
