    "Positioned within an arc of gracefully proportioned picture windows, this workshop affords a restful view of Icemule Trace's perpetual winter.  The chilly outside landscape contrasts with the comfortable ambient heat within the guild.  Dominating the center of the room, a gold-veined marble workbench, fitted with a silver gem lens assembly, a crucible, and a clear glass alembic, resides in splendor."
