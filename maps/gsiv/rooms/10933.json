  "description": [
    "Faraf Way meanders through a cluster of homes with gaily patterned banners fluttering from latticework above the doors.  The street is crowded and the ever-present awnings of street venders add more pattern to the busy view.  Above the craggy roofline of homes, a line of lebbek trees is visible, their tops swaying in the light breeze."
