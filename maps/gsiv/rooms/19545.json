    "Set within a semi-private circle of smaller cauldrons, pots, pans, and various unusual implements, a copper-based training cauldron squats on claw feet.  Other cauldrons with similar privacy are scattered about the dimly lit alcove, and a few large gouges score the floor where the cauldron was dragged."
