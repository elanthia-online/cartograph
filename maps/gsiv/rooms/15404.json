    "The broad sweep of the black marble floor is interrupted by a miniature wooden gallows.  Halfway to the golden oak ceiling, an oil-filled copper sconce hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls.  A heavy cast iron tomb and a hammered copper hanging rack are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
