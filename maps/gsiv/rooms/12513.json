    "A large glaes-trimmed desk dominates this small but well-kept office.  Papers and documents of all kinds are neatly stacked and organized on shelves that run the entire length of the walls.  On the ceiling, a large glass skylight allows the moonlight to flood the room, casting eerie shadows across the walls.",

On the ceiling, a large glass skylight allows the sunlight to flood the room, reflecting beautiful rainbows of colors through the various crystal ornaments that hang near it."
