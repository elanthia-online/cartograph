    "This short, narrow ledge runs along the side of the massive mountain.  Deep fissures along the face of the mountain are jagged and sharp, untouched by any form of erosion.  A jagged cliff leads upward, bearing natural handholds created by the cracks and crevices in the rock.  The damp air hangs heavily throughout the area, creating a cool, raw atmosphere."
