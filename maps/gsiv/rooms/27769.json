    "Wide swathes of plain black silk drape the walls from a central heliotrope ring suspended from the ceiling.  Crystal oil lamps give off a subdued light, illuminating notes of prayer tacked to the silk drapes, and casting shadows behind an ebonwood female mannequin and an ebonwood male mannequin.  A violet vase on a diminutive midway altar holds a single black rose."
