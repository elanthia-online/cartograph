    "Shallow rolling hills and lush, tall meadows occupy this wide stretch of land.  The wind blows quietly, causing the tall grass to wave about you, dipping and swaying as in a carefully choreographed dance.  The dancers crowd down the hills toward the sea, turning from green to yellow to grey as they pass away, as if wiping off grease paint at the end of a long night."
