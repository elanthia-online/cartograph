    "Brightly lit and well-organized, the interior of the shop has a welcoming ambiance.  Wedge-cut pieces of red oak are inlaid in the ironwood flooring and flare outward around a slightly dented bronze sales counter.  An ora-handled spruce chest rests next to a simple burled pine stand placed a few paces behind a grizzled dark wool rug at the back of the semi-circular room."
