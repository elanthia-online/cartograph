    "Unlike other sections of the mine, where the walls have been relatively smooth, all of the surfaces of this cavern are rough and uneven.  A colorful variety of stalagmites and stalactites present curious and grotesque images all around you.  Water runs down the sides of the strange formations, and drips into a shallow pool that has formed at the bottom of the cavern.  A strong pungent odor similar to vinegar is in the air."
