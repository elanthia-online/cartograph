    "Amid piles of unfinished lengths of wood, several workbenches nestle in a veritable sea of thin wood shavings.  Clamps, planes, presses and other tools of the bowyer's trade stand in neat array on the workbenches.  Tucked into the few remaining spaces are various hooks, displays, and racks filled with the final product of the craftsmen's exacting labor."
