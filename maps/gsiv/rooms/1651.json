  "description": [
    "The creek slows and widens, forming a narrow lake stretching off to the east.  The constant, gentle breeze stirs small whitecaps which make the lake seem to sparkle in the moonlight.  In the distance to the northeast, through the thin growth of tanik trees, you see a rather dilapidated house and shed standing in a field of sunflowers.  The sharp smell of tanik sap pervades the area.",
