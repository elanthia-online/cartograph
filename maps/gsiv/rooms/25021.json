  "description": [
    "Several torn oilcloth tents line the back of the settlement, their mesh coverings ripped apart and strewn about the dried grass.  A frayed piece of rope drapes several sun-faded tunics and trousers, the line strung between two bloodied poles, the clothing splattered with various stains.  A lump of flesh lies unmoving beneath a woolen blanket, cast aside along with makeshift pillows buried by the dry soil."
