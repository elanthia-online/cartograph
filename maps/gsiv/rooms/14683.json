    "Deep green draperies rustle between the tall leaded glass windows that line the western wall of this spacious room.  Overstuffed sofas and chairs covered in burgundy leather have been arranged to provide several casual, comfortable conversation areas for the most renowned residents of the lands.  Overhead, a massive wrought iron and crystal chandelier sways gently from a heavy chain attached to the high, polished maoral ceiling."
