    "Crenelated and pewter-edged, watered silk squares dip from the ceiling to form a decorative overlay that hides the tent's support posts and complements the dark marine blue panels of the walls.  Blown glass fisher's orbs dangle from the ceiling, their interiors filled with votive stubs that burn brightly and provide a warm glow of light to the cramped space.  A low round table surrounded by plump cushions sits in the center of the room, while a large cloth-filled chest rests near the rear wall."
