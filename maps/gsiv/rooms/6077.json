    "Small mounds of dirt can be seen here and there under the wheat.  Fire ants emerge from the mounds and tread preset paths to collect food, returning to the mounds to deposit their bounty and go out once again.  The ants seem unperturbed by the presence of anything around them until their mounds are disturbed, and then they boil from the ground in a frenzy of military activity."
