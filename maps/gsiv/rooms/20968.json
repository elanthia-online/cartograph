    "Covering the rolling foothills are blankets of lush green grass that flare with the color of thousands of wildflowers.  Nearby, a group of colorful blossoms burst out of the ground, their bright red petals edged in vibrant green.  Small tendrils of mist waft down from the hills, pooling gently in the dips and gulleys of the broad expanse.  To the south, a sheer cliff disappears into the valley below preventing all movement in that direction."
