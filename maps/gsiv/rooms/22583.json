    "Several pin-tucked silk pillows are stacked on either side of a branch-inked vellum screen, the pale cushions surrounding a bronze-plated table set against the wall.  Bolts of gauzy fabric interweave from each corner of the room to link with a pierced golden lantern set high upon the ceiling, the remaining lengths forming a semi-sheer curtain gathering in folds upon the planked floor.  Set along the far wall is a pale glass-inlaid mosaic, the circular design a mix of floral and abstract shapes."
