    "Rectangular beds are arranged in neat rows and raised a couple of feet for ease of access.  Each bed contains several specimens of herbs, with pewter label tags in front of each.  Bees buzz about stalks of star anise, hazel alder, and chervil.  Specimens such as grains of paradise, blue vervain, and starwort lend their colorful blossoms to the overall beauty of the garden."
