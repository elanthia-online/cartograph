    "The heavy scent of pine tar mixes with the odor of ale and cooked delicacies. The sounds of revelry and the clink of mugs appear to come from beyond the stone arch.  Dwarves in assorted garb enter and go east or through the arch, though those dressed in rougher attire seem to prefer the arch.  The patrons entering also seem to be much less inebriated than those exiting.  The patrons tread over an expansive oval rug, and silhouettes of larger-than-life musical instruments hang on the walls."
