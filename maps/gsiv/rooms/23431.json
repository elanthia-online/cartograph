    "Everything seems to be order in this shop, as it has been neatly arranged, except for some crooked wooden shelves which have been set into the east wall.  There are some large statues holding lanterns, which provide iillumination to the surroundings.  On the far wall a small painting hangs, prominate for all to see and in the center of the room is a cracked glass display case."
