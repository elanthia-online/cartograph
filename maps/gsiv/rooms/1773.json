    "Scattered about the shiny granite floor in seemingly no particular order are chairs, chairs, chairs!  Looks like the inventory was set out in a hurry, or maybe the owner does not have much imagination or need to impress the clientele.  From deeply carved and ornately detailed pieces to stark simple types, you get the impression that here there is, indeed, something for everyone."
