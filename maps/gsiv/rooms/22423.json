    "Tapering to a point in the western most section of the room, the walls are fashioned of fitted wood and the seams are made weather tight with a thick coating of tar.  Repurposed oar-slots are flanked with rough wooden shutters, while the open expanse is filled with colored glass that resembles froth-covered waves.  A round table surrounded by stools sits in the center of the room and is laden with delicacies."
