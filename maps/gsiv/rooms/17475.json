    "At the base of the hill, a vast forest of silver-barked aspens stretches far into the distance towards the Dragonspine mountain range.  The dim, shadowy form of a stand of seven huge trees, their heights stretching as high as the mountain foothills to the east, shimmers and distorts as the winds cascade down from the distant range, rustling the surrounding woods into a chaotic, swaying mass."
