    "Deep in the hollow of this ancient tree, a few carved wooden stools are clustered around a fine-grained oak slab that serves as a table.  Soft light streams in through a large knothole, softly illuminating the area.  Sequestered from the hustle and bustle of the town square, this quiet chamber offers a cozy haven for weary caregivers."
