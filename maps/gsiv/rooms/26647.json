    "Moonlight glints off of long sections of steel railing that encircle the roof of the wagon.  A cool breeze musters up a slight scent of jasmine and lavender that filters into the open area from a small hole in the floor.  Piles of pillows have been stacked up in each corner, offering a nice spot to rest and enjoy watching the stars.",
