  "description": [
    "The incline stops at the foot of a suspended bridge that traverses the abyss of empty air with delicate stairs made of polished ebony.  Each stair hangs on silver wire no greater in diameter than a hair, and the steps are inlaid with tiny pieces of colored wood that form a pattern of runes around the risers.  A tapestry hangs on the wall opposite the stair, its vast dimensions dwarfing the delicate construction of the stair."
