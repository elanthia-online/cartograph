  "description": [
    "This wide stone ledge extends out from the canyon wall, overlooking the gates of the city that spreads out below to the south.  The river cuts a ribbon between the blocks of buildings and hedges, and the blue waters of the sea past the docks are visible in the distance.  Boulders of red and grey stone are scattered along the ledge, making fine seats from which to enjoy the view."
