  "description": [
    "This room is festive and cheery compared to the rest of the Thrak.  Decorations of foil and brightly colored parchment adorn the walls, and streamers hang from the large wrought iron chandelier.  Tables and trays laden with good victuals, fine drinks and novel items fill the room.  The clamour of rambunctious, good-spirited adventurers echoes through the chamber."
