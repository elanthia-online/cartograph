    "The air loses its salty taste completely here as fresh, clean air pours in from the northwest.  The fungus and plant life seem to like it too, as they grow unchecked all over the walls and floor of the tunnel.  They do, however, lose quite a bit of their iridescent qualities when compared to the ones to the east."
