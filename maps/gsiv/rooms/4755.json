  "description": [
    "Trampled ferns and upturned leaves mark the passage of a large beast along the old path.  Scored with deep footprints, the dark and rich earth of the forest floor has been disturbed.  The broken stalks of small bushes and shrubs dangle at odd angles, and the bark of a nearby tree has been scratched, its dark surface riddled with abrasions.  A musky odor, like the scent exuded by wild animals, lingers in the still air."
