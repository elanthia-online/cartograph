    "On the ground you see thousands of sparkling glass bits.  Inside a wood framed building you see an odd-looking chair with long steel rails where the arms would be.  A rack with a dozen six-foot long blowpipes lies next to it.  You also see two large brick ovens that have fallen into disrepair.  To the southeast, you see a stout wooden door leading into a castle tower."
