  "description": [
    "Here, in the quiet space above the main room, the vaulted ceiling forms sloping walls that cradle the small loft in a comforting embrace.  A thick bedroll, with a pile of pillows shoved against a row of overturned crates that serves as a makeshift headboard on one end and a mass of rumpled blankets on the other, lies nestled in this cozy nook.  Running the length of the platform's outside edge, interrupted only by a gap for a sturdy steel-rung ladder, a low wooden railing protects against unwanted tumbles."
