    "Wide shelves follow the curve of the platform as they rise from floor to ceiling along the western and eastern edges.  Transparent gossamer silk panels line the backs of the shelves to allow sunlight to filter through to create natural illumination that shimmers across the vials of dye stored there.  Silk banners line the sides of a short rope bridge, forming a colorful corridor to and from a tidy workroom to the north.",
