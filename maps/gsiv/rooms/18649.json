    "Textured stucco walls form the small storage space and are painted with colorful fish that swirl through a forest of dark seaweed.  Opposite the entry is a small desk and floor mat that are set before a floor to ceiling bookcase riddled with books, scrolls, and vellums.  A carefully shielded brass lantern looks out of place amongst the more colorful sea glass globes that dangle from the linden wood rafters, its cheery glow creating a prismatic spray of light."
