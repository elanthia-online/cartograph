  "description": [
    "Hemp rope marks the perimeter of this small clearing, while thick strands of duckweed float on a somewhat obscured water course.  Blankets of yellow-headed moss grow upon shale slabs that are partially buried into the soft ground and short tufts of grass grow everywhere else.  To the southwest, the dark shadow of wyrmwood trees gives the landscape a gloomy cast.  A tall lanky fellow stands beside a tray of assorted knives resting atop a few stacked crates and an open-lidded red wooden barrel."
