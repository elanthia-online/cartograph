  "description": [
    "Silver and ebon-veined marble tiles spread across the floor towards walls that are painted with scenes of the wild hunt.  Standing before a wide open window is a full-length mirror, while a glass-covered wrought iron table nearby houses a set of playing tiles.  Standing at opposite sides of the room, a set of polished linden stairs leads down into the ebon chapel, while a marble fauna-patterned staircase leads into the white chapel."
