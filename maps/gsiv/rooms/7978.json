    "This is the plain office of the Head Clerk of the Cooperative of Houses of Elanthia.  Behind a small desk sits a rather harried civil servant.  His quill pen is never at rest as he records and updates every detail needed for the efficient administration of the houses of Wehnimer's Landing.  The main features of note are the long velvet curtains on the wall behind the desk, that seem to rustle slightly.",
