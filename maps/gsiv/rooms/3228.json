  "description": [
    "This old tavern was once a great storehouse for meats and perishables.  Dangling from the ceiling are several meat hooks from which lanterns have been hung.  Tables and benches are placed along the walls leaving the center one big muddy pit.  A row of crates is stacked along one wall forming a bar of sorts, tended by a rather grimy looking halfling.  The only other feature is a heavy wooden door, which leads to the frigid weather outside."
