    "Discarded and rusting pieces of armor cover a small clearing in the tall reeds, many overgrown with mosses and lichen, and held together by little more than rust.  Only a single shattered skull fixed to the trunk of a dead tree offers any evidence of human remains in the clearing, while the silence of the fens is interrupted only by the buzzing swarm cloud of gnats."
