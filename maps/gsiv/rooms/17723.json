    "This small grassy area barely encroaches on the swamp.  A black wrought iron gate stands partially open, supported between two walls over which a thick privet hedge towers from the other side.  The brackish swamp water appears undisturbed as it extends back into the cypress forest, and dragonflies skim the water's surface, looking for a meal in the oppressive humidity.  A long bridge stretches out into the mists to the north.",

The brackish swamp water appears undisturbed as it extends back into the cypress forest, and winking red firefly candles flit around the darkened tree trunks.
