    "A large ebon coffin sits atop an altar of yellowed bone, its slick surface awash in the light of hundreds and hundreds of thin pillar candles that surround it on every side.  Lustrous steel tables are placed throughout the room, a variety of potions, chalks, powders, and various empty bits of glassware set atop them.  Dark stains ring the floor, mingling with the charred rings that also vie for space in the small chamber."
