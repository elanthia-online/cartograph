    "A wall of rock, too dense to hollow out further, forms two walls of this showroom, creating a rough triangular shape that makes the viewing of wares for sale on a large stand difficult.  The crowd shuffles in an oval formation, allowing each patron a chance to make their way in front of the stand and purchase an aventail, if they find one to their liking.  Those having difficulty making a decision are forced to make their way through the odd dance multiple times."
