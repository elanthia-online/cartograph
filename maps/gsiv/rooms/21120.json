  "description": [
    "Scratched into the bedrock is this hollow cavern that stretches below a great banyan.  A solitary candle on a simple altar lends illumination and shadows to the pockmarked and irregular formations surrounding the underground den.  An elaborate upside-down tree growing down from the ceiling has been shaped from the banyan's roots and mirrored in carvings that span the stone walls.  A light musk infiltrates as the air is stirred through the cavern, and a subtle but oppressive silence hangs in the air."
