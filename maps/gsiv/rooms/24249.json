    "A small alcove holds a window seat piled with silken cushions, its mullioned windows overlooking the far-off bay.  On the far wall is a double-sided haon armoire.  In the corner sits a wide brass bed heaped with snowy down pillows, soft linens, and a lush white fox fur coverlet.  Two large pillows sit on the thickly woven white wool rug before a greystone fireplace.  Above the brass-edged oaken mantel hangs a framed scroll."
