  "description": [
    "Lit by a single small glowing toadstool that rests atop each of several tables, the room is dimly lit and scented faintly of patchouli and mildew.  The mica chips in the curved rock walls only sparkle faintly in the varied lighting, the rainbow hue of the toadstools adding a variety of color to the drab room.  Scattered atop the smooth stone floor are a few padded stone benches, each one paired with a carved marble end table.  From the eastern passage, the sound of falling water echoes softly."
