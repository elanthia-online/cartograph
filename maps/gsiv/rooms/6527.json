    "The road has climbed up a promontory that offers a shorter variety of grass, as well as a sweeping view of the plains.  The panorama is illuminated by soft moonlight, broken on the eastern horizon by a range of mountains.  In the distance, a herd of animals sleeps peacefully upon the pasture, their variety disguised by the haze of distance.",
