    "The warm air hangs still in this subterranean corridor, surrounded by the hill on all sides.  Torches mounted along the walls merely illuminate the way, as there are no decorations or furniture to cast their light on.  The tunnel forks, leading toward a tall stone door to the northeast and a square stone door to the northwest.  A round steel hatch claims an unusual place in the tunnel's ceiling."
