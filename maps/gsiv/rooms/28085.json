    "Framed in dark pine, the supports of the tent are lined with ivory wool.  Surrounded by cushioned benches, a small copper brazier is centered in the room, its hammered body polished to a brilliant gleam.  Tucked next to the opening is a narrow rattan basket full of dry tinder and wood.  Bits of material, needles and spools of thread are neatly organized on top of a small birch worktable."
