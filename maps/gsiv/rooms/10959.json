    "Smaller and more intimate than the lobby, this sitting room is graced by a large fireplace with a massive mantel.  Underfoot, a light grey carpeting muffles footsteps that would otherwise echo throughout the room.  The grey of the carpeting complements the unusual plaster walls, which are painted a shade of blue which reminds you of the color of the waters of Maelstrom Bay on a clear sunny day.  In one corner, beside an inscribed brass plaque, an ornamental sword hangs above a large copper kettle."
