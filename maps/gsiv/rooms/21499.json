    "A small table sits off to one side in this area of the tent, its surface covered with spare parts - strings, nocks, and grips - as well as a cloth-lined segmented box and a battered metal tray.  A single glass-shaded lantern hangs over the table in addition to those of white paper, providing ample light for the space that is obviously dedicated to crafting.  A small stool with a raised back sits in front of the worktable, and a quiver of violet-fletched arrows dangles from it.",
