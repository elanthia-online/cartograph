    "To the northwest, a sprinkling of homes can be spotted among the assorted hardwoods, but here, the river glides past patches of pristine wilderness.  The howl of a wolf resounds somewhere in the distance, yet two egrets wading on stilt-like legs at the shore seem unperturbed.  To the south, a large shape looms in the midst of the river."
