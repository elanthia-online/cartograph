    "Several rows of wooden stands surround the large, closely clipped lawn of the parade grounds.  Centered between the south stands is a raised crimson pavilion, which houses several rows of plush seating and an opulently appointed throne for the king.  Scores of gold and crimson pennants strung from high poles surrounding the area whip proudly in the breeze."
