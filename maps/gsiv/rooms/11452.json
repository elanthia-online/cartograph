    "The sea swells break lazily against the stony base of a low cliff wall.  The cliff runs from the southeast to the northwest, where it gradually forms a rolling headland.  The tiled roof of a tower is visible above the headland to the northwest.  The green waters of Maelstrom Bay, muted by the moonlight, stretch out to the west.",
