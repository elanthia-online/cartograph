    "What was probably once a narrow street cutting between the old crumbling buildings of this abandoned village, is now a carpet of thick grass.  Most of the buildings have collapsed, leaving little more than a few rocky foundations.  One small cottage nearby, however, seems to be mostly intact, and there is also a small shack standing to one side of the grassy street."
