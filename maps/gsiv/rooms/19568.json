    "[Scents of Thyme]"

  "description": [
    "Large trees line the perimeter of the garden, providing shade and scent.  The leaves of bayberry, allspice, and nutmeg crown them, while jasmine and vanilla vines climb through their bowers.  Yarrow, lavender, and rose each take their places toward the center where the sun strikes more often, and small coriander plants add their spicy tang to the mingled scents.  Slender candles, each born of a different shape, are suspended in the air by mysterious means."
