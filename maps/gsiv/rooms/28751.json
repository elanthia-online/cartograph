    "Painted white plaster walls rise from a white limestone floor.  Just above an elegantly dressed maiden statue hangs an ornately rendered clan crest, and a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling completes the picture.  Some wrought-iron hooks and a hammered copper hanging rack stand side by side in the middle of the room."
