  "description": [
    "Dilapidated wooden planks make up this small seedy-looking booth, and a halfhearted attempt to mask the shoddy workmanship with a thin coat of noxious green paint only serves to make the squat structure uglier.  A table bridges the gap between the outside and the proprietor inside, whose voice continually rings out as he hawks his game.  A large banner drooping across the top of the wooden booth displays \"The Ol' Switcheroo\" in splotchy red letters."
