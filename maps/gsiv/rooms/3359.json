    "Silken standards, bearing various denominational insignias and mounted directly into the wood floorboards, line one side of this room.  In front of the standards is a two-tiered glass table with a large candle-centered floral arrangement.  Scattered rugs, hooked from vibrant silk yarn, appear like colorful shadows under the weight of the cabinets that hold them to the floor."
