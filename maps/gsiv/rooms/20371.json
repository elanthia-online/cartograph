    "Providing bright, sunshine-like illumination, several golden sconces hanging around the wagon hold white candles cased in glass.  A series of pale and dark green rugs is spread atop the rich carmine carpet, and over those, several chairs and cushions provide spaces for repose.  Matched to the green rugs in color, silk drapes over the walls and frame a door, and the ceiling is painted with various religious symbols."
