  "description": [
    "Smaller nuisance animals can be trapped or poisoned.  Larger nuisance animals can be fenced out.  Nuisance weeds, however, never seem to be driven away entirely.  Weeds of various shapes and sizes insinuate themselves among the corn stalk and cover the soil in the areas between the rows.  Hoeing removes the larger ones, but new weeds soon spring up in their place.  It would be so much easier to just grow weeds."
