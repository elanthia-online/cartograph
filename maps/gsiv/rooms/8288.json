  "description": [
    "A shabby, neglected hut lies to the east, barely catching your eye as it blends into the foliage.  As you gaze north and south, you notice that a row of similar huts lines the eastern side of the path.  All the doors of the huts face west, in the direction of the entrance to the black, domed edifice that dominates this part of the forest."
