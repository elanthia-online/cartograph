    "The trail turns here, widening to show a magnificent structure.  A tall round building looms above you, seemingly carved from the very rocks of the mountain peak itself.  The building is smooth and there are no visible seams to mar the fine craftsmanship.  On top of the large building is a curious slitted dome."
