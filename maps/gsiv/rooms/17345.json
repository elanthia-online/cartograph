    "The wall is broken by niches that run from floor to ceiling, each containing a wooden mannequin wearing a suit of leather armor.  The figures along the westernmost length of the hall are clad in full leather, while the armor on those to the east is fitted with metal studs or worked cuirbouilli leather.  The gear is elegant in its simplicity, but some of the leathers seem to be overdue for an oiling."
