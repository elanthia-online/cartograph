    "Cobalt-hued panes blend with frosted white to create a beautiful stained glass window that occupies the entire northern section of the small crawlspace.  Teak and cedar boards, arranged in alternating patterns, rise from the wrought-iron reinforced floor and connect the slanted ceiling, their rich fragrance making the humid air almost overwhelming."
