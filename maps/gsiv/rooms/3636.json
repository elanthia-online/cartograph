    "Nighttime has settled in on the Isle of the Four Winds, and a crisp coolness is in the air.  Accented by silvery moonlight, a small pale yellow-hued boutique appears to have a golden glow to it.  The shadows of the mannequins, lit from behind by the flickering candlelight inside the boutique, move across the street in an eerie dance.",
    "A boutique has been nestled in amongst the various shops along Honeysuckle Avenue.  In contrast to the surrounding shops, the small cottage housing the boutique has been painted a soft yellow with a lighter shade for the trim.  Ladies pause, now and again, to admire the latest fashions modeled by the mannequins in the window."
