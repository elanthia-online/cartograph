    "The room is small and square, appointed with a polished wooden floor and a high, silver gilt-paneled ceiling.  Gaps in the argentate are set with windows of cobalt glaes, the light from which illuminates the chamber's single desk and chair with a faintly bluish cast.  One wall is affixed with a series of books, each chained to their case with a ringlet and delicate length of links.",
