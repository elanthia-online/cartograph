    "A highly-polished black marble counter runs along one wall, flanked by two large brass urns, each planted with a flowering tree heavy with red and white blossoms unlike anything ever seen in nature before.  The white marble tiled floor reflects the light from the brass and crystal wall-mounted lamps, giving off just enough illumination to sign the registration book."
