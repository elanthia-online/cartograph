    "Delving into the bowels of the earth, the pit is a stinking morass of unidentifiable muck that reeks like a herd of dead roltons, drenched in fish guts, rotting in the sun.  The walls of the pit are jagged and uneven, providing plentiful handholds that are firm, if a bit moist.  Fresh air swirling down through a wide hole above is the only thing leavening the incredible stench."
