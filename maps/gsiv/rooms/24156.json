    "Layers of plush silk carpets in shades of blue cover the ground in this area, and some felt-lined grey hoarbeam racks stand around the perimeter of the room.  A single candelabra illuminates a small grey hoarbeam table, and the faint mingled scents of beeswax and sawdust linger in the air.  A draped archway along one crystal-spangled velvet wall leads further into the shop."
