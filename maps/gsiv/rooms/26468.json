  "description": [
    "The interior of the small potting shed is awash in competing aromas...jasmine, gardenia, tea rose, loamy soil and even a bit of manure.  Some well worn wooden tables crowd the small space, each scattered with an assortment of gardening tools and plants in different stages of growth.  Several gardening texts and empty containers are stacked haphazardly beneath the tables.  A small wash basin rests in one corner."
