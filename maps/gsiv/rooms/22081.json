    "This wide, carpeted hallway is quiet and peaceful.  At the end of the hallway are some wide double doors, above which is a rosette stained glass window.  Sunlight illuminates the glass, casting the hallway in bright colors.  An ornate winding staircase leads up, and a lapis-inlaid plaque hangs next to an ora-bound door."
