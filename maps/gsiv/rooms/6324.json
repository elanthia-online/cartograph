    "Set aside from the hustle and bustle of the front room, this cozy salon has an atmosphere of luxury and comfort.  A warm fire crackles in the hearth, and thick, colorful carpets cushion your steps.  Sparkling display cases show off the finest gems, exquisitely crafted and faceted to catch the warmth and brilliance of reflected light."
