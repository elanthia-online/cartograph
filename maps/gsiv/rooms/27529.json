    "A finely woven silk rug spans the hardwood floor, and a pair of pillow-laden couches upholstered in plush, cream velvet sit against opposing walls.  In the center of the room, ambient light twinkles off precious jewelry displayed on a large, oval glass-topped case.  Nearly hidden behind a full length mirror in one corner is a black velvet curtain.  Next to the entryway is an iron-reinforced oak trunk."
