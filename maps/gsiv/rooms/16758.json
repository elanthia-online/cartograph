    "A sculpted white marble fountain stands in the center of this room.  Kneeling on a dais rising from the pool of water is a willowy cleric holding an alabaster ewer.  Water streams forth from the vessel, splashing over a fallen warrior draped across the platform.  Overflow from the fountain has been channelled off to the south."
