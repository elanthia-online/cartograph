    "The gentle rolling hills are dotted with small clusters of linden and bergamont trees, creating pockets of shade across the lawn.  Several smaller trails diverge from the main path, providing ample opportunity for a private, peaceful stroll.  The main path heads west toward the courtyard and southeast toward a small copse of trees."
