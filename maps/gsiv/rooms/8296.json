    "The path through the cluster of ramshackle habitations brings you nearer to one of the eight black basalt legs of the spider shrine.  The similarity of the huts, and the confusing jumble of curves and bends in the wall of the temple make you pause momentarily to get your bearings.  You continue along the north-south route, barely noticing a hut to the northeast."
