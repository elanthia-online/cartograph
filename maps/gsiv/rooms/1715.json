    "To the west the ground rises sharply up a sparsely vegetated incline, while to the southeast it plunges into the thick conifer forest.  Further up the hill the trees regroup to become a thick forest again. The cloven hoof prints of some large herbivore or herbivores cross back and forth on the hillside as if the animals were unsure which way to go.  Perhaps some of their confusion can be attributed to the wolf-like paw prints intermingled with the hoof prints."
