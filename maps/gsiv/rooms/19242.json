    "A tight rattan mesh arcs overhead to form a nearly impenetrable dome supported by the tall hedges all around.  The dome's thickness reduces this glade to near darkness.  Hundreds of steel cylinders, one foot in diameter and polished to a mirror-like sheen, support a single candle each at heights ranging from ground level to above a giantman's head.  Fifty of the candles are of various shapes and sizes, only one of which is lit at any one time.  The rest are tall white candles that blaze brilliantly."
