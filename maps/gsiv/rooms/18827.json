  "description": [
    "A tamped dirt path leads out to the cliff, emerging from the woodland and stretching along the narrow edge.  Not overly high given the scale of this mid-river island, it's still quite a drop to the water lapping below.  Only subtle differences in dark hues provide any perception of depth and distance between the rushing current, the night sky, and the shadowy banks that parallel this finger of land.",
    "A tamped dirt path leads out to the cliff, emerging from the woodland and stretching along the narrow edge.  Not overly high given the scale of this mid-river island, it's still quite a drop to the water lapping below.  Skeletal roots emerge from the raw clay soil exposed by the erosion, their limb-like protrusions suspended in the air."
