    "Deep wine-hued velvet curtains drape the rear wall of the small room, providing a softening effect for the otherwise austere stone walls of the keep.  Several glaesine lamps dangle from ornate mithril chains, casting a dim amber light across the plush Loenthran carpets.  A stately carved haon desk occupies the center of the carpeted floor."
