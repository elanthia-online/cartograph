    "Rising shelves upon shelves display the Guild's extensive collection on empathic lore, lovingly kept in good condition by a trio of librarians.  A pair of simple lacquered tables and surrounding padded chairs offers an opportunity for research or relaxation.  The particularly ancient texts and tomes are housed within tall glass cases."
