  "description": [
    "Some mad decorator transformed the belly of this beached fishing boat into a royal audience chamber fit only for a kobold king.  Rags and tattered clothing serve as tapestries and a carpet of red woolen undergarments, stitched end-to-end, leads up to a rickety barstool painted gold.  To the south gapes the rotting, fish-scented maw of the hold.  The crushed and inverted remains of the crew's quarters are to the north."
