    "The occasional strain of music drifts in from the northwest, floating gently on the air.  Beyond a small grove of trees, a stone-clad building is barely visible.",
    "A plinth, topped with a sculptural bronze, sits in the middle of the road, leaving any traffic merging between Glaendier Wey and Var to wend around it.  The lantern-lit roundabout is framed by a series of identical residential structures, each one faced with white marble.",
