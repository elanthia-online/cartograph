    "Polished stone walls reflect the light of a trio of steel-banded torches that has been inset into ornate brackets.  Centered over a brick-lined tunnel is a golden banner that reads \"Arena Entrance\" embroidered in thick ebon thread.  An ebon banner over a golden arch reads \"Viewing Chamber\" in elegant golden embroidery."
