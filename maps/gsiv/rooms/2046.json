    "Soft shafts of moonlight create a striking pattern, which knifes through the jungle darkness on all sides.  The trail curves around the monstrous bole of a yintosh tree, its thick buttress root system offering a veritable maze of shadowed crevices and cubbyholes.  A carpet of the yintosh's broad leaves lie around the tree's perimeter, their curled edges cradling puddles of water where the moonbeams are reflected here and there.",

A carpet of the yintosh's broad leaves lie around the tree's perimeter, their curled edges cradling puddles of water where tadpoles and mosquito larva dwell."
