    "Cresting the slope of the berm, and at the farthest point from the waterline, hardy tufts of beach grass poke up through the dark sand, preventing storms and high winds from eroding the narrow shelf.  Close by, a bumbling aelotoi tourist mills about on a raised log platform loosely bound together by strands of torn, dirty cloth."
