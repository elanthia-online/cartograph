  "description": [
    "Set beneath the ancient gaze of several gnarled oak trees, this small section of the garden houses a somber, still feeling that pervades the chilly air.  Numerous rows of simple granite markers are set into the ground, and a small granite obelisk pierces the surroundings with its tall spire.  Snow dusts the grass lightly, the errant currents of winds sending it in a soft, mournful dance before it settles once again."
