    "Sheltered by a tiered curving wall choked in vividly luminous moss, the courtyard's view of the night sky is rent by the branches of a weeping willow.  The ancient tree casts its drooping branches over a ring of hooded statues.  Winged and faceless, the metallic creatures loom over a path of smooth cobbles proceeding toward a dark stone hold.  Sweetgrass and banks of bleeding-hearts are little more than swaying silhouettes bordering the walkway.",
    "Sheltered by a tiered curving wall choked in pale moss, the courtyard rests in the shade of a weeping willow.  The ancient tree casts its drooping branches over a ring of hooded statues.  Winged and faceless, the metallic creatures cast their stygian shadows over a path of smooth cobbles proceeding toward a dark stone hold.  Blue-green sweetgrass and banks of bleeding-hearts border the walkway on either side."
