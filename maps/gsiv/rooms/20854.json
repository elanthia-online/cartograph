    "Dim torchlight reflects from numerous weapons that serve as both decoration and ready defense.  Ancient claidhmores and sharp swords hang from positions of honor around the room.  Below each weapon is a plaque naming the warrior who once carried it and the manner of their demise.  A solid modwir bed is pushed into one corner, leaving the rest of the room free for practice.  The floor itself gleams in polished patterns, worn by years of bare feet practicing the forms of the Dhe'nari martial arts."
