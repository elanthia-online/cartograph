    "Within this stone enclosure, some light seeps in around the rock formation that partially blocks the opening to the cave.  The sandy ground is loose and easily stirred up, evidence that few travelers have visited this small, hidden cavern.  Some metal hooks hammered into the wall display various garmets for sale, protected from plunking drops of water by a thick, makeshift, fabric cover.  Patches of green lichen around the space pulsate in sync with the echo each whistling breeze or howling wind that pass outside.",
