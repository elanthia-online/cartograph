    "Beavers have created a dam across the stream here.  Birch and oak limbs have been carefully placed to slow the stream and create a deep pool of water, an engineering marvel that has redirected the stream away from a beaver lodge.  To the east are several tree stumps, each gnawed in the same pattern with notches on the sides of the stumps.  Water cascades gently over the top of the dam, the sound soothing and relaxing, as it continues to flow to the southwest."
