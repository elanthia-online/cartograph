    "The alternating wood-paneled walls give way to solid mahogany here, encapsulating the room in a dark cocoon.  Sconces line the walls of this portion of the long hallway, bathing the room in flickering candlelight, and a dark full-length mirror hangs between two of them, helping to amplify the light.  In the center of the space, a sign rests on an easel beside a pair of leather chairs, while both attendants and barbers linger nearby."
