    "Set side by side in the center of the floor are a vaalin-banded heavy crossbow bolt trunk and a glaes-banded light crossbow bolt chest.  Immediately behind them rests a glass-topped arrow display.  The remainder of the wagon houses a few flickering lanterns, hung from beams overhead, and numerous archery targets that decorate the walls."
