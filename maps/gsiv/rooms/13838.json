    "A thick stand of birch trees shelter the trail as it meanders through their midst.  Here and there, cabins sit beneath the trees, the wooden shingles of their roofs dyed a soft green by the forest mists and dew.  Chickadees flutter through the branches of the trees, making the hanging catkins tremble and setting the tapered leaves to fluttering."
