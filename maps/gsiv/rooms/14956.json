  "description": [
    "Grasslands grow in a golden sea of verdure to the horizon.  The prairie is omniscient, its largess nourishing roving herds of rolton.  In the foreground, a few cottages rise from the waving field of grasses, their thatched roofs meshing seamlessly with the fields.  Stands of trees cut through the plush expanse where streams meander through the prairie grass, hidden but for their plume of vegetation."
