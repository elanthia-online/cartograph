    "The trail comes to a halt beneath a large rock overhang, creating a cave-like shelter open on three sides.  Beneath the overhang, the air is noticeably cooler, and rank with the smell of damp earth mixed with sulfur.  The face of the rock wall is heavily striated, however faint and ancient designs are still noticeable despite the ravages of time, heat and harsh elements."
