    "The walls here are cloaked in shadows and faded tapestries, their subjects now obscured.  Remnants of old rugs lie on the flagged floor.  The wooden rafters of the ceiling are festooned with birds' nests and the webs of spiders long since gone, like decorations for some dreadful festival day.  In this chamber, time seems bound only to the measured tread of decay."
