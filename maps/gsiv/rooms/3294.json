    "From here you can see across the valleys and hills that stretch out for miles to the west.  You pause a moment to take in a breath of fresh air and revel at the beauty unfolded before you.  You're very close to the top of the hill and as you glance around, you notice the faint outline of another opening hidden by a snowbank.  A ramp leading down is off to one side with iron railings on either side."
