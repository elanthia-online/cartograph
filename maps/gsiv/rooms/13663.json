    "[Nautilus Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A single slab from a giant modwir forms this table, its rings providing a record of seasons for the past century.  Dozens of nautilus shells inset flush into the top coil outward from the center of the table, echoing the spiraling pattern of their own fragile carapaces.  The shells grow gradually in size as they reach the edge, the first scarcely larger than a gnome's fingernail and the last nearly as big as a giant's fist."
