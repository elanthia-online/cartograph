  "description": [
    "Much of the area has been cleared of vegetation, its muddy ground a mixture of wet dirt, coarse sand, and slick clay.  Interspersed with a few sparse tufts of dead grasses, tracks from foxes, raccoons, and a host of small rodents crisscross the muddy ground.  One tall, yellow sunflower, its head brimming with tiny black seeds, stands sentinel over the area, the lone splash of color in this othrerwise dreary space."
