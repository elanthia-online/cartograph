    "Plush feather mats sit in a large circle on a planked wooden floor.  A polished writing desk is pushed up against the far wall, sheaves of paper and fresh plumes waiting for use.  A vase filled with colorful wildflowers sits by the doorway, the blooms releasing a sweet fragrance into the room."
