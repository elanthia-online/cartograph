    "The inside of the shop is warm and cheery, with sunlight streaming in through the windows and a fire in a small, black brazier providing just the right amount of heat.  The floor is heavily lacquered with a dark varnish, and the walls sparkle with cheap, multicolored gems.  An elderly dwarf sits behind a narrow worktable.  He selects gems from a stack next to the vise, clamps them in, meticulously cuts them and moves them off to a small box.  Every so often he glances up and greets a customer.",
