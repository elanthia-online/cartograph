    "A rainbow colored flag hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a dappled celadon marble floor.  There is a jewel-inlaid caddy on one side of the shop and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on the other."
