  "description": [
    "Casting its shadow upon the area, a large wooden guard tower rises above the tapered points of the surrounding colony walls.  A hard-packed dirt road pushes through gates to the west, though it quickly turns to mud as it travels east.  Steady traffic from loggers skidding their daily haul keeps the bustling town entry busy."
