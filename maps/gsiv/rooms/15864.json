    "Beneath a vaulted crimson-hued glass ceiling, a ruby-eyed smirking wolf skull hangs on one of the polished black obsidian walls.  Some ruby-inlaid finger bone-crafted hooks and a low interlocking skull-crafted table sit in opposite corners while a bone-crafted pyramid statue rests on a flawless obsidian floor."
