    "The high vaulted ceilings of this ballroom are the only aspect of grandiosity to be seen in an otherwise meager setting.  Rows of rickety tables have tall silver wastebins set at each end, but lack any apparent seating.  A short wooden chair sits next to a glass-paned polished teak case on a small stage, opposite the maple door leading to the foyer."
