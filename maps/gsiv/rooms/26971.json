    "Thick panes of glass separate the garden from the terracotta tiles of the pathway, the broad expanses protecting the denizens of the enclosure from escape and harm.  Dried-out, dead branches rest at angles against the travertine walls, their crossed limbs home to an enormous grey chuckwalla.  Dark, burnished brown sands litter the ground where flat stones provide sunning spots for an armadillo girdled lizard that is housed in the western section of the garden."
