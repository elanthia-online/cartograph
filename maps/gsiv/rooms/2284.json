    "This room was spared the destruction so evident in the other chambers, possibly because it was in the process of renovation.  Row after row of gleaming black marble pedestals await stone coffins that will never be placed.  Snaking up from small fissures in the stone floor, thorned vines spiral up tall pewter candlesticks and threaten to crush the heavy ceramic urns that line the walls."
