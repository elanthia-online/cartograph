    "The trail widens here into a small glade, and a few hardy flowers have taken advantage of the extra light and grow in small clumps along the edges.  The dense forest quickly closes in just past the glade's perimeter, however, and its towering, vine-draped trees grow so closely together that they discourage wandering from the path."
