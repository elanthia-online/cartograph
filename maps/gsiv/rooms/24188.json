    "A set of crooked splintering steps lead out of this tiny one-roomed wagon.  A stained waern pelt rug is spread across the warped floorboards and a dusty glass case stands in the center of the area.  Leaning carelessly against the case is a misshapen pine crate supporting a lopsided poplar table."
