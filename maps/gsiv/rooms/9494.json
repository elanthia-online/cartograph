    "Several crates stand in one corner, all marked with the same destination.  The rest of the room is austere.  Only a stone desk and straight-backed chair break up the monotony of a grey granite floor, grey granite walls, and grey granite ceiling.  Two huge luminescent toadstools in large stone pots, each occupying opposite corners, appear sufficient to light the room.  A steel door allows exit to the corridors of Zul Logoth, a dark hallway extends to the west, and a wide corridor extends south."
