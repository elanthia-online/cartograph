  "description": [
    "Walled with heavy white canvas that plummets down in straight lines from the supporting poles, the dyeing area is large, wide, and airy.  The roof overhead is also made of canvas, though it is raised several feet higher than the walls on separate poles to allow sunlight to filter in.  Billowing in the passing breeze, light drapes, of a sheer white variety that is a lovely contraposition to the blue tile flooring, serve as dividers between the courtyard and the individual dyeing stalls."
