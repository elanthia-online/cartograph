  "description": [
    "Thick brush and shrubs act as a hedge between the Guild grounds and the dark of the jungle, its length broken by a large wooden shed.  A tiger-shaped topiary threatens to pounce from its position near the shed entrance.  Several red sandalwood trees grow along the path circling the guild hall."
