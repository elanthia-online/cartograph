  "description": [
    "The prominent feature of this room is a huge natural arch that cuts through the thick rock layer of the north wall.  Through this arch you can see a small part of what seems to be a tremendous chamber.  Away from arch, to the southeast, can be heard the quiet gurgle of slowly flowing water."
