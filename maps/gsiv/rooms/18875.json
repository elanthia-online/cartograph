    "As you enter the chamber, your eyes are drawn upwards to the cathedral heights of the crystalline dome.  A warm luminescence cascades about you, its hues dancing and shifting in a rainbow of patterns that leave you with a feeling of tranquility.  A fresh herbal scent lingers from the multitude of lush, verdant plants that hang along the walls.  A glimmer of understanding washes over you as you notice a simple stone altar resting in the center of the chamber.  A spiral staircase leads downstairs."
