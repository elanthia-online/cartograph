  "description": [
    "By all external appearances, one would have expected the serene atmosphere born of years of reverie and worship within the castle's chapel.  But this is no place of quiet introspection.  Bones lie scattered about haphazardly.  The air is fetid and almost unbreathable.  Small burial urns sit in no discernible order among the litter of bones, making navigation through the structure an exercise in caution.  Set into niches in the walls are piles of skulls, their blank stares a sinister accusation."
