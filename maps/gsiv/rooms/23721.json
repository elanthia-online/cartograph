  "description": [
    "Somewhat sheltered from the elements, the dark slate floor of this deep, covered porch runs the entire length of the humble abode.  Standing at the top of a short flight of steps leading down to the garden, a freshly painted crimson door invites guests inside.  Flanking the door, two pairs of scuffed utilitarian benches provide ample seating."
