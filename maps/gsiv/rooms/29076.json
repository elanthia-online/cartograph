  "description": [
    "Waist-high grasses obscure the narrow pathways, their waving green seedheads bulging with future generations.  Thick vines enclose the surrounding vegetation, encircling the perimeter of this small, impoverished village.  The open, grassy area is one of the few spaces enjoying the silvery bath of moonlight from the open skies above."
