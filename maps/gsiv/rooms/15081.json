    "A blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A carved ebonwood dinghy sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is a glass-topped mistwood counter on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
