  "description": [
    "A tall standard atop a stout metal pole has been pitched beneath a great thanot tree, its silken banner shifting and sighing in the day's gentle breeze.  Ferns and pale lavender phlox surround the base of the pole, and fragrant wild thyme has grown across the path, providing a lush green carpet underfoot.  A glaesine lantern mounted upon an ironwork post stands near a carved marble bench."
