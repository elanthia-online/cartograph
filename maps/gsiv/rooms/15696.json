    "The lobby has richly carved wooden walls.  A thick rug covers the polished floorboards, helping to insulate the chamber from the pervading cold outside a heavy, carved door on the east wall.  Overhead, a massive lantern sheds soft light from hundreds of candles placed along its wrought-iron arms.  Each small flame is protected from drafts by a small, amber-colored paper shade."
