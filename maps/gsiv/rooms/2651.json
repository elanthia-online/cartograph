  "description": [
    "The drake's back is a mere span away from the ceiling, giving a panoramic view of the shrine and its central mass of ice.  Like the neck, the beast's back is ridged with spines that are dropped into a near-horizontal attitude.  The great wings are furled close to the body, and a finger-like claw is visible at the tip of each."
