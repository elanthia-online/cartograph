    "Several beat-up wooden figures stand in the center of this chamber.  One of them has been dressed in a tattered black cloak and its head lolls drunkenly every time someone's weapon connects with a loud *THWAP* -- amazingly, the head hasn't fallen off yet.  Wooden and metal practice weapons are racked neatly against the walls, along with suits and pieces of stray armor."
