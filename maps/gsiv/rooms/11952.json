    "The overgrowth grows very thick, reeds and other plant life crowding the edge of the river in chaotic confusion, forcing the trail to turn northwest toward the woods.  The abandoned nest of a water bird, little more than concave bundle of twigs and grass, lays nestled within a particularly thick cluster of bulrush."
