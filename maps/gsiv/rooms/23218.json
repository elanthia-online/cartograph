    "Warm steam from a sapphire blue pool fills the room.  The cold from outside is blotted from memory as the radiant warmth begins to sink into your bones.  About the pool are lush plants, more suited to a tropical environment, that seem to thrive upon the warmth.  Lily pads float on the surface of the bubbling pool."
