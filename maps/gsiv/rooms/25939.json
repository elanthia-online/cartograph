    "Festively colored flowers sprout in wild profusion in a loose circle around a limestone statue of a grinning man, illuminated by a trio of burning torches.  Tall stalks of gladiolus and larkspur grow beside sprawling bushes of showy begonias, while sheaves of snapdragon stalks in a variety of brilliant colors battle for space.  An abandoned bottle pokes out of the flowers, partially obscured by the edge of the statue.",
