    "Along the side of the deck, an alcove has been crafted into the bulkhead wall and made over into an elaborate shrine to Niima, Charl's gentle daughter.  Painstakingly pieced mosaic work, crafted primarily from the nacre of oyster shells and iridescent shards of abalone shell, forms a representation of the spirit as a young girl.  Strapped securely to the side of the ship is a small shore boat with a set of warped oars lashed across the benches and held by a fish-filled net and rigging contraption."
