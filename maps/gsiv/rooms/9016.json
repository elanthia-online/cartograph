  "description": [
    "Several people gather around a blazing firepit in the middle of the courtyard, telling stories and singing songs as they watch sparks dance towards the heavens.  Several windows are open and lit with a candle, adding to the festive atmosphere.  From one set of curtained panes comes the delicate notes of a sweet melody accompanied by an enchanting voice.",
    "Bright and sunny, this large courtyard offers little in the way of shade, other than what appears naturally from the angle of the sun.  Trumpet vines snake along the building walls thickly, covering them with lush foliage and reddish-orange blossoms, while skirting clear of the many windows."
