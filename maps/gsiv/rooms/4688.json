  "description": [
    "Warmth emanates from a monstrous red brick fireplace situated opposite cushy sofas arranged around a plush oval rug.  Savory aromas drift in from the swinging kitchen door, while hearty laughter roars from around a lacquered mahogany bar.  The tawny plaster walls have been framed with the same thick wooden beams that cross the high ceiling.  Wrought iron sconces cast the entire tavern in a warm glow befitting its friendly atmosphere."
