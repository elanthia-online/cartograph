    "Smoldering piles of what may have been vegetation lie at the base of the large dirt mound, lending their foul, burnt smell to the dry air.  Small cracks riddle the structure's surface, scars from the intense heat that constantly bathes the area.  Several trenches in the dark red earth can be glimpsed at the borders of the towering hill, though black ash is the only thing that fills them."
