    "[Ruined Tower, Courtyard]"

  "description": [
    "The courtyard spreads broadly under the imposing presence of a tall, aging tower.  Remnants of a large broken seashell lie shattered in front of a portcullis leading into a rough stone gatehouse.  The archway over the portcullis is formed of white and blue corals, and an imprint at the apex of the arch shows a relief of the fallen shell.  Fragments of blue tile lie scattered across the courtyard."
