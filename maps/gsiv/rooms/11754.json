    "Indolent guards lean casually against an iron portcullis, lazily surveying their surroundings.  A refreshing breeze from the ocean wafts into the yard, and seagulls can be heard in the distance.  The massive granite walls of the prison cast long shadows across the yard.  A wide, beaten trail leads back towards Marshtown Road.",

A refreshing breeze from the ocean wafts into the yard, and seagulls can be heard in the distance.  The massive granite walls of the prison rise high above the yard, blacker than the night sky.  A wide, beaten trail leads back towards Marshtown Road."
