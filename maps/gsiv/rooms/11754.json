    "Indolent guards lean casually against an iron portcullis, lazily surveying their surroundings.  A refreshing breeze from the ocean wafts into the yard, and seagulls can be heard in the distance.  The massive granite walls of the prison cast long shadows across the yard.  A wide, beaten trail leads back towards Marshtown Road.",

A wide, beaten trail leads back towards Marshtown Road."
