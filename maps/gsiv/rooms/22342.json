  "description": [
    "A tiny hut sits far off the road, a low fence surrounding the large courtyard that fronts the home.  The lawn is covered with leaves, and the small garden near the hut's porch is weed-filled and untended.  Occasionally, one of the shuttered windows cracks open just enough to reveal that the home is not deserted."
