    "Six stalls line the walls here, and feature a misericord in each small open-fronted enclosure.  Several are occupied by preaching clergy, their sermons alternately overrunning each other as they rise shrill with delusion or sink quietly into stammered muttering.  The cacophony completely overwhelms the harpsichord being played in the background by a gossamer-robed giantwoman, whose lips curl in a lunatic grin."
