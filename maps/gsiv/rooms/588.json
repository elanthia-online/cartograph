    "The trail widens as it branches into a 'Y'.  Both branches to the west disappear quickly from sight within the thick trees.  To the east, the forest opens up somewhat with dogwood and redbud trees growing between the black boles of the oaks here and there.  A large, flat stone marks the intersection, its edges framed by the eerie light of iridescent mushrooms glowing in the moonlight.",
