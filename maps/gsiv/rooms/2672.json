  "description": [
    "The octagonal alcove is surrounded by a row of double columns.  On the west wall, between an arch of alternating red and black stone and a high doorway, stands a frieze of carved felines.  Three pairs of lions rampant, each with hind paws planted on the ground and forepaws on the back of his companion stand in the icy shadows like silent guardians.  They depict an attitude of strength at first glance, but the curling tongues of ice-covered flame licking at their backs impart a whiff of evil."
