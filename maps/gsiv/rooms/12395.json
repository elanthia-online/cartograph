    "A troupe of dwarven musicians entertains the crowds at this busy intersection.  The dwarves gathered around clap appreciatively, some singing along in clamorous, off-key voices.  Other dwarves wander by about their business, many headed to or from the town gates to the north.  One huffs and puffs with a large wheelbarrow full of rocks."
