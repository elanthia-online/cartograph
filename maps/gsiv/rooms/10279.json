    "Red and yellow hawthorn fruit has been ground into the soil, turning the narrow footpath into a sticky morass.  Any temptation to seek higher ground is quelled by the thorny picket surrounding the shrubbery.  Some bristly greenbriar grows over the top of the hawthorn, blocking all but a few tiny motes of sunlight.",
