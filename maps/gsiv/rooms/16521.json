  "description": [
    "The broad sweep of the mistwood floor is interrupted by a spiral staircase blocked by a thick iron chain.  Halfway to the arched ceiling, an ironwood-framed portrait of a mortally wounded knight kneeling before a glorious sunrise hangs on one of the crumbling yellow brick walls.  A splintered shipping crate and an open wooden barrel lying on its side are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
