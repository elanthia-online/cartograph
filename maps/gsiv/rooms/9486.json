  "description": [
    "A perfectly circular room provides snug sleeping quarters.  White woolen carpet covers the floor from wall to wall, and cotton sheeting in the same white shade hides the ceiling.  The room's supporting timbers are painted a light grey, while the granite wall between the timbers is painted a vibrant shade of dark blue.  A metal frame bed rests against one wall, and a toadstool in a stone pot occupies a spot near the opposite wall.  A faux-birch door allows exit to the corridor just outside."
