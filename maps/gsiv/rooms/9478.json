    "This backroom contains several tables, a bright metal sign, and boxes piled upon boxes.  Several stacks have tumbled down or, were it not for the wall they encountered, would have tumbled down.  Markings on the boxes indicate origins from places both familiar and unfamiliar.  Several dwarven clerks paw through the boxes as if looking for certain ones.  From time to time, a clerk will grab one of the boxes and rush out, often returning with the same box and a puzzled look."
