    "The sturdy platform is constructed between the branches of the great oak, bounded by heavy moss-covered railings and covered by a network of carved beams that blend with the tree's branches above to protect from the elements.  A narrow rope bridge, almost invisible in the network of hanging vines that wind around it, leads west into the branches of another tree."
