  "description": [
    "The sound of water dripping into the shrine's pool echoes quietly within the north niche.  Only a modicum of light manages to intrude, leaving the imposing figure of \"Strength\" cloaked in partial shadow.  He is turned, and looks back over a thickly muscled shoulder, almost as if he were about to disappear into the niche's wall.  The twisted pose of the statue emphasizes its powerful musculature."
