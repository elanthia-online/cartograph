    "On a small, square dais covered with a rug of azure velvet sits a massive ornate throne carved from mahogany.  The headrest is fashioned into a golden crown set with sparkling jewels of all hues, and the wide armrails are crafted to resemble ornate treasure chests.  A semi-circle of smaller, similar thrones face the platform, though the atmosphere is more of brotherhood than worship."
