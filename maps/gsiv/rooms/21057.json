    "Thousands of trees compete for space as far as the eye can see.  High overhead, small fruit bats glide continually from branch to branch, their movements giving a sense of rhythm to the jungle surrounds.  Bright light is at a premium here, the convergence of foliage far above casting deep shadows and blotting out much of the moons' pale beams.  Enormous ferns stretch out feathery blades, each leaf adorned with tiny drops from one of the jungle's many brief downpours."
