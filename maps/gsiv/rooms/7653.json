    "Water dances about you in lazy waves as you float in this underground pool.  The chamber above is domed and uncommonly smooth, and there are no visible exits save for the opening you just swam through.  Looking upward, the most prominent thing visible is an enormous statue of white coral tinged with blue flecks.  The statue's form glares down at you with impassive, seemingly harsh, blue eyes."
