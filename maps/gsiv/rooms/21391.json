    "Pristinely white walls make up the wagon's interior, and both the wooden ceiling and plushly carpeted floor are the same clean white color.  Hanging lanterns shaped like round globes flush bright candlelight around the area, illuminating a white door that nearly blends into the walls.  The only hint of color in the interior is in the masks hanging on hooks and crooks around the wall."
