    "Hanging down from an open-rafter ceiling are several oil lamps that offer the room wavery illumination.  Pushed up against the northern wall is an oak desk, which is cluttered with random documents and papers.  Along the floor, stacks of books offer little room to traverse through the wagon, other than a path from the desk to the oak door."
