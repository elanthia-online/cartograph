    "A sizable stream enters this cavern from an opening near the ceiling in the southwest wall.  The water from the stream splashes into a rock-lined pool, dousing the walls with its spray as it hits.  The pool feeds through a grate placed underneath a set of carved stairs.  Where the grate goes is anyone's guess, as even the years of rushing water have left it intact and far too strong for even a giantman or dwarf to bend.  The stairs have been carved of sandstone and lead upwards."
