    "The road traverses the face of the hillside, moving back and forth in a series of short switchbacks.  The builders apparently dug out much of the soil, then built up retaining walls to keep the hill from collapsing totally and taking the road down with it.  After all this time the skill of the builders is very much apparent, although in short stretches the shifting soil has moved the roadway out of line or taken it far down the hill."
