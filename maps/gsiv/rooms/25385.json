    "Three small, pastel blue beds are lined up neatly against the far wall.  Lacy white curtains, slightly yellowed with age, flutter occasionally with errant breezes wafting through an open window.  A fuzzy stuffed kitten protrudes from an open toy chest, set upon one corner of a floral patterned carpet."
