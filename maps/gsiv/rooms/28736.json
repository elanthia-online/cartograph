  "description": [
    "The heat of a large fire burning in the far wall warms this small, local pub.  The walls have been set with a rich, dark wood.  Small, round windows allow the sunlight to filter through.  Above the fireplace is an elaborately carved bleakstone mantle.  An array of pipes traveling up the walls and along the ceiling connect a large number of kegs to the taps behind a long mahogany bar, which dominates most of the room."
