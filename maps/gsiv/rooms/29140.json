    "Unusual gadgets and gears dominate the southwestern wall of the corridor, each terminating in a clear glass tube filled with numbered glass orbs that bob up and down in a clear liquid.  To the northwest, a high-topped oak desk and a round-seated tall stool are positioned upon a soft rug of bright orange and teal.  An oak-framed chalkboard dominates the remaining wall, its dark surface riddled with instructions, patterns, and daily tasks for the facilities workers."
