    "Deep furrows can be glimpsed between the thin, tall grasses, the small trenches pooled with thick, inky-black water.  A clump of brush nearby has been half charred, most of it lying on the ground in a pile of ash.  To the south, a sparse woodland edge is visible beyond a crumbling stone wall that borders the overgrown field."
