  "description": [
    "The blackened, skeletal remains of a burnt-out shack stand amongst its ashes and partially burned boards.  The roof and walls were burned and caved in, and only a couple of the corner posts still stand.  An acrid, burnt odor mingles with the musty smell of the fungus overtaking the decay of this small building."
