    "Crown molding of pale linden circles the room, each length carved with a spiraling pattern of tiny blossoms.  Clean white walls contrast with colorful banners hung about that represent each unique House in the Cooperative.  Centered on a thick patterned carpet is a large desk covered with parchment and ledgers, behind which a house clerk stands.  A row of chairs rests near the ornate wooden door that leads to the hall beyond."
