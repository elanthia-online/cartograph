  "description": [
    "An expansive chamber stretches above the hanging platform serving as its base.  The ceiling is made of some sort of translucent material that more resembles air than a solid substance.  The sides of the tree dwindle into scrambled paths resembling veins tracing through the crystalline bubble.  Sunlight intrudes in great beams that shimmer on the strange, monumental construction, a machine that takes up most of the room within the sphere."
