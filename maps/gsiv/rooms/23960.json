  "description": [
    "A thick damp mist envelopes the space immediately adjacent to the falls, rising from the roaring crash of the Tempest waters as they plummet below.  Little can be seen through the enshrouding mist, which only breaks apart occasionally to reveal a glimpse of the small town situated on the egg-shaped island below in the river.  The roar of the falls is almost deafening, and the rushing of the waters shake the earth underfoot."
