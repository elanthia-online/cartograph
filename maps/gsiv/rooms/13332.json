    "A terraced garden stretches away from the lane, its central nave covered with gravel and bordered on each side by a perfectly groomed lawn.  At the far point of the promenade is a circular garden guarded by the slender figure of a marble nymph.  The alluring fragrance of lilies growing at her feet reaches out to the lane.",
