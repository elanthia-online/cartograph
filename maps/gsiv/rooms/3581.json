  "description": [
    "The hallway is impressively tall, its high ceiling giving it a narrow appearance although it is of spacious width.  Large tiles cover the floor, their rich sienna surfaces incised with glyphs.  On the stone walls, ora braziers are bolted at intervals.  They are crafted in a blocky style, which is elegant in its simplicity.  The light held in each fixture flickers to life as the shadow of movement passes before it."
