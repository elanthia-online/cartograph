    "Two soft horsehide couches are set before a cozy stone hearth.  From behind the rosewood bar, a bald giantman grins perpetually.  Great hooded candles are set on low tables along the walls, providing a soft, reddish light.  On the wood-paneled walls, two paintings are hung next to a great vultite claidhmore."
