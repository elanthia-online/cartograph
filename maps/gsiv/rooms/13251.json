  "description": [
    "The trail winds through ash and sycamore trees, their feet cloaked with underbrush.  The sycamores' bark is mottled in a yellowish grey, with irregular patches peeling from the trunks in curling sheets, which resemble parchment.  Mourning doves, hidden from sight in the thick foliage, coo to one another occasionally in their distinctive style."
