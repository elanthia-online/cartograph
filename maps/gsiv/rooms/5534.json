  "description": [
    "Weeds grow up between the tiles paving this small courtyard.  Broken chairs lie scattered about, and the rusted frame of a once glaes-topped table leans sadly to one side.  An empty, modwir door frame leads into the manorhouse, but no sign of the door that once hung there is visible, only splintered gaps in the frame where the hinges were bolted.  Just a bit northeast of here stands a well."
