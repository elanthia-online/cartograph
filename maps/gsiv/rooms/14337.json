  "description": [
    "The walls of the room are hung with indigo-colored velvet drapes and a thick, plush carpet that covers the floor from wall to wall.  A couple of sturdy lounge chairs flank a generous sofa that sits up against the far wall.  On the sofa and chairs, a few white, lace-covered pillows add a splash of light to the room's deep blue, like stars in a night sky."
