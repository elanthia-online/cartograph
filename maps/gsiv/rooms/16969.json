    "The walls of the small chamber curve inward deeply, their surface a teeming mass of dark obelisk-shaped crystals whose tips hold a deep golden sheen.  The far northern wall harbors a group of large crystals, their varied hues shining dimly in the faint light as they hum with deep reverberations of power.  Tracings of energy race along the faceted edges of the crystals, their facets pristine and flawless."
