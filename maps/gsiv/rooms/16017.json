    "Heaps of straw are strewn across the stone floor, while piles of hides requiring more scraping to remove the fur and loose bits of flesh from the skins have been dumped into the corners of the workshop.  Off to the side of the stained counter, two enormous vats partially sunk into the ground contain limestone and bleach.  Various implements of the trade can be found on pegs circling the room and in crates and other containers."
