    "Large stones, nearly boulders in size, lie exposed and imbedded in the hillside, and a narrow path crosses them in several places in its spiral around the hill.  Long tendrils of dusky moss trail down the sides of a small knoll farther up the hill and off the path.  Far below, shadowy rooftops reflect faint silvery light and scattered windows are alight with a warm golden glow.",
