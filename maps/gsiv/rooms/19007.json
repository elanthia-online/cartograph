    "Overstuffed chairs and sofas rest on plush silver carpeting in this elegant resting room.  Several large paintings illuminated softly by nearby lanterns hang on the walls.  A fire burns merrily in the spacious fireplace, its mottled grey granite a soft contrast to the surrounding dark brown walnut paneling.  A refreshment cart in the corner offers several tasty and refreshing selections."
