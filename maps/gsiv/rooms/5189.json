    "The waters swirl and eddy a bit at this end of the lagoon, moving toward the falls that can be heard in the distance to the west.  Insects swarm near stagnant pools that have gathered near the water's edge.  The forest falls away to the plains which continue to the edge of the cliff face off to the west."
