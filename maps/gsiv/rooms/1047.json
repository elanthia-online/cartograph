  "description": [
    "A vast forest spreads out to the northwest, north and northeast.  Stately pines reach up high toward the sky with younger trees clumped around them.  The forest floor is littered with a thick carpet of dark grey and light grey needles as well as prickly, sticky pinecones.  In the distance, an owl calls out, its hooting breaking the silence of the trees.  The trail does not lead into the forest, but parallels it to the southeast and moves off into the moor to the southwest.",

The forest floor is littered with a thick carpet of grey and yellow needles as well as prickly, sticky pinecones.  Squirrels scamper through the trees, chittering loudly at each other.  The trail does not lead into the forest, but parallels it to the southeast and moves off into the moor to the southwest."
