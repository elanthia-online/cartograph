    "The broad sweep of the mahogany floor is interrupted by a serene golden wyvern fountain.  Halfway to the skylight-set ceiling, a noble elf maiden portrait hangs on one of the textured black silk walls.  A floral-etched ceramic case and a large cherrywood cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
