    "The panoramic vista stretches away from the granite boulder on all sides like a fantastic, moonlit tapestry.  To the east, spray from geysers hovers in the air like fog, while to the northeast, an immense series of waterfalls crash down the mountainside like plumed ribbons.  On the western horizon, the dark surface of the sea glimmers in the moonlight.",
