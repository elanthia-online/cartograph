    "Spiraling stone steps open into a room with a glass-paneled dome overhead.  A massive steel-riveted telescope is mounted on a rotating plate controlled by a series of pulleys.  Long benches positioned before the paneled glass north wall afford a spectacular view of the town and surrounding environs.  A large teak table curves along the south wall beneath framed constellation images."
