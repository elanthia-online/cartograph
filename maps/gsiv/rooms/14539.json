    "Spearing through the upper reaches of the canopy, the trail's peak offers a bird's eye view of the lush aviary.  Treetops shiver with the movement of the hundreds of birds that call the canopy their home.  The humid air is rife with the scents of flowers, but contains an underlying tang from the constant decay of vegetation in the forced heat of the dome."
