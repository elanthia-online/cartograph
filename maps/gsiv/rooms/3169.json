    "The trail continues its companionship with the frozen stream as it wanders eastward and turns north.  The steep icy embankment nearby stands in testimonial to the erosion of the former river's flow.  The ice and snow encased ground reveals itself in occasional deposits of silt that emerge alongside thickets of phragmites and brown grass."
