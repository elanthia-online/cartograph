    "Devastation has been wrought upon the contents of the room, if it can indeed be called a room.  The blackened walls are caving in at various points.  Broken desks, chairs, and other unrecognizable items are scattered about in random piles of debris.  Bits and scraps of sodden parchment lie in tiny mounds here and there, the ink having bled until it turned the watery masses a dark grey."
