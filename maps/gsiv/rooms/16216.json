    "The tavern is a generous room set with long tables and benches.  A few more private tables are nestled in the back, each one with its own tapestry curtain.  Candles burn merrily, giving the room a warm golden glow.  In the corner sits a small stage where a few instruments are leaned against tall stools.  You also see a long modwir sideboard with the tavern menu on it and the tavern door."
