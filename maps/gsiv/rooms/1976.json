    "Buffered from much of the sounds from the surrounding city, only noise local to the area fills the air.  The scent of freshly sawn wood lingers and the silent night is punctuated by the occasional clang of metal.  A small natural spring emerges from a tiny split in the canyon wall, captured by an elaborate wooden chute and trough, for consumption by the locals.",
