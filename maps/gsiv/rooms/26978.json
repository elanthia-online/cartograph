    "Moist, steamy air trickles in from the northwest and is heated by ironwood and drakar columns that flank the moss and limestone pathway.  Towering drakefern, larger than can usually be found in the wilderness, create a decorative screen of burnished green that almost completely obscures the travertine walls of the garden.  Crimson lava stones form barriers around a variety of bromelaids, their waxy leaves varied in color and shape, while an enormous red obsidian sculpture rises in the background."
