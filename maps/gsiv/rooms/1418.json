    "Tilled fields and grazing lands for the city's flocks spread out north and south of the road.  The road is used by the locals headed to and from Vornavis' North Gate, so it is well-traveled and easy to follow.  Further east it veers closer to the Cairnfang River, where a timber bridge is barely visible.  To the west you can make out the low walls and canvas roofs of the caravansary."
