  "description": [
    "Supported by newly constructed wrought iron brackets, torches decorate the uneven and craggy walls of the small chamber.  Fresh air whistles through a jagged fissure at regular intervals causing the flames to splutter and gutter, their erratic behavior casting long shadows upon the ceiling and floor.  Rising like a scar out of the dark earth, a ragged aperture bisects the opposing wall."
