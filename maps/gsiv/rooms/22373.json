  "description": [
    "Columns of crimson marble, their indentations and ornamental corbels aglisten with gold leaf, support an arched ceiling broken only by a skylight high overhead.  Below it, a grand seat of crimson leather and blond wood sits atop a raised dais at the chamber's center.  Concentric patterns of black stone spread outward from the dais, breaking the uniform procession of red and gold floor tiles.  A semicircle of chairs faces the high seat, though all are smaller and none so evidently comfortable."
