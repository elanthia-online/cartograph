    "The tunnel ends at a jagged, partially collapsed opening.  Moonlight streams in liberally through the upper part of the opening to illuminate the tunnel's walls and, wherever it strikes the water, seems to totally eliminate the green glow.  The water rushes out of the constricted opening with a loud roar, spraying as if under pressure and plunging down to intermingle with the river's waters just below.  The water tugs at you insistently, beckoning you to become one with the river as it soon will.",
