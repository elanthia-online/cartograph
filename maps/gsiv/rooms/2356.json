  "description": [
    "You are situated between two hills in the glacier.  On the southeast hill is the Temple, accessible by a set of carved ice steps, while a simple trail leads up the side of the other hill.  A couple of ambitious shopkeepers do business from shops within the ice, and several families have made homes in the glacier.  From up the trail, a vigorous splashing can be heard."
