    "Several faded banners depicting images of mythical beasts and symbols hang limply from the uneven walls, evidencing the lack of air currents here.  Primly positioned in the center of the cavern, a humongous flat rock serves as a pedestal for a collection of uncut gems.  A small plaque engraved with silvery inscription has been affixed at dwarven eye-level."
