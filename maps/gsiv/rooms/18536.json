    "Wide wooden countertops, freshly scrubbed after a long day's baking, await the bustle of work that will accompany sunrise.  An open cookbook has fallen to the floor.  A large window with an extra wide sill fills the back wall.  Fragrant evening breezes occasionally send yellow checkered curtains grazing the tops of pies left overnight to cool.  A punched tin pie cupboard set near the open doorway is stocked with desserts favored by locals and visitors alike.",
