  "description": [
    "Moonlight spills through three wide-set windows along the eastern wall that are flanked on either side by cream-colored cupboards.  Grey-swirled white marble countertops run along the base of the cupboards, while an ample marble sink takes up the center space under the windows.  A large stove is pleasantly situated in one corner, while a spacious dining area takes up much of the rest of the room.  An enormous lor table with ample seating for a large party is centered on a soft ivory rug that glows softly in the moonlight."
