    "A squat log building has been built into the northeast corner of the palisade.  Split log steps lead down to the heavy, iron-banded door that is half below ground level.  A pair of burly dwarves stand to either side of the steps, suspiciously eyeing each person as they come and go.  A brightly painted sign depicting a golden pouch bulging with coins hangs above the door."
