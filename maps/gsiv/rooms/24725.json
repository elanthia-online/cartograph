  "description": [
    "Perhaps once a trading hub, the area here is littered with a wooden graveyard full of half-standing wooden stalls and the scattered wreckage of wagons and carts.  Along much of the wooden debris, old bloodstains still cling to the jagged pieces strewn about.  Nestled below the canopy of a small tree is a short wooden table, seemingly freshly painted and holding piles of rotting fruit and food."
