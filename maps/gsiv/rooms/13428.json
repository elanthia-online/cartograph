    "Sickly-sweet moonflowers trail along the tips of the wrought-iron gate to the east, their pale blossoms shivering briefly in the wind.  A trickling stream hides beneath trails of moss and clusters of plants, its soft trickling sounds echoing peacefully about the garden.  Ancient stones are strewn haphazardly across the ground, their tiny cracks and flaws harboring collections of verdant green moss."
