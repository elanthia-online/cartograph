    "Rodents and moths have diminished the beauty of the large patterned rug covering most of the floor, causing bits of the flooring to peek through.  The walls are cracked and stained and the curtains covering the large windows droop sadly from their mountings.  Few pieces of furniture remain, leaving the room barren.  Arches lead north to the dining room and back out to the corridor."
