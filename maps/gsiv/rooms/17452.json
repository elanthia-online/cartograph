    "Thick oak poles support this once fine tent.  Showing the wear of time, the inside of the tent is patched in a multitude of places.  Mismatched lengths of canvas, leather, and cloth have been sewn into the fabric of the tent to help keep the elements out.  Various bits of weaponry are haphazardly shoved into a wooden barrel that sits next to a black pedestal table.  An aged wooden weapon rack upon a tightly-woven wool rug sits off to one side."
