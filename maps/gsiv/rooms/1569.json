    "The road slopes gently upwards as it hugs the wall of the ancient tower, the massive stone blocks gradually beginning to rise toward the rooftops to either side.  Two scruffy-looking boys whisper quietly to one another beneath a single torch higher up near the entrance of the tower, apparently engaged in a game of knucklebones.",
    "The road slopes gently upwards as it hugs the wall of the ancient tower, the massive stone blocks gradually beginning to rise toward the rooftops to the south and east.  Ragged youths continually run back and forth as they chase an old barrel hoop up and down the slanted road, their laughter echoing across the sprawling roofscape of houses below."
