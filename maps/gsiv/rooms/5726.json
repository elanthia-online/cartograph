    "The walkway turns abruptly southeast from here, while striking due west toward a large hill.  The buildings here sport signs reading \"Jag Hill\" and have shining steel numbers attached.  This section of town seems very well kept when compared with the rest of the sprawl.  A dark, narrow alley leads due south between two taller buildings.  Denuded of its mane by the elements, the skin of a cragviper is stretched on a tanning frame that hangs above a doorway just inside the alley.",
    "An assortment of meat cleavers, bone saws and fang-jawed pincers hanging on the back wall, and the stained butcher block counter that Yonno Rundig is leaning on give this shop an unwholesome air.  Of course the odor of rotting flesh that permeates the room might also have something to do with it."
