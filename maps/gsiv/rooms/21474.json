    "Festive paper lanterns have been positioned around this rather large room, bathing the area in a soft glow.  Several patrons stand near an iron-banded wooden keg, conversing and showing off their recently-acquired wares while they enjoy a drink.  Thick mocha-hued rugs cover the floor and help absorb any unwanted sounds from the swamp outside.",
