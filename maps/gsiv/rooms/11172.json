    "A long table of polished modwir stands in the center of the room, flanked by benches.  Campaign chairs with brass hinges are still neatly positioned at the head and the foot of the  table.  A third bench stands against the far wall.  Over it is a fresco of a shield divided into six fields, each showing a bird or beast and representing the six companies assigned to the garrison."
