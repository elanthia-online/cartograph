    "[Circle of Trees, Platform Level]"

  "description": [
    "A large platform surrounds the trunk of a tall cedar tree here, and various intricate carvings of woodland animals decorate the smooth wooden surface.  The scent of wood smoke wafts on small breezes, though the origin is not clear from here.  The leafy canopy above provides shade for the area, while several yellow glass lanterns offer golden illumination.  In one direction, a set of parallel woven ropes offers tremulous support, while to the east a more sturdy rope bridge connects to a distant platform."
