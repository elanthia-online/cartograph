    "Black clouds build in the distance, perhaps another storm preparing to sweep across the flats, its fury unchecked.  Snowflakes flutter gently down from the grey, overcast sky, tossed around at the mercy of a swirling breeze.  The lights from the houses in the neighborhood reflect off the low-hanging clouds, making the heavy slate shade a lighter grey directly overhead."
