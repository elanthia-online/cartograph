  "description": [
    "Carved into the very bedrock of the town, this room has obviously been crafted by skilled dwarven hands.  A small shrine sits almost unnoticed near the door, and the sleeping quarters are squirreled away in the back, almost hidden behind a craggy stalagmite.  Most visible, however, are a fireplace burning what looks like a young forest, a surprisingly well-stocked bar and several implements of death and destruction hanging within easy reach."
