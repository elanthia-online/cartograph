  "description": [
    "A curved modwir counter cuts the room in half.  In front of the counter, a polished expanse of wood flooring spreads out into an open waiting area.  Behind the counter can be seen a series of wood shelves and pigeonholes stacked with a wide variety of boxes, bags and letters.  A canvas curtain suspended from the ceiling forms the back wall of the room."
