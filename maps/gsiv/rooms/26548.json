  "description": [
    "Curving sharply away from the edge, the path suddenly opens up to a small landing that is blasted smooth by some elemental force.  Deeply stained marks trace their forgotten history along the granite, while pebbles clatter along the even floor before being hurled through the air by the raging winds.  Indigo and silver mist dominates the area and seems to emanate from within a ravaged stone entry."
