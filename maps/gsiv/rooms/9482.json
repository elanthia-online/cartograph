  "description": [
    "A low stone counter wraps around a small private space, providing a place for the innkeeper to do business separate from the customer area.  The counter is bare except for a ledger, a sign and a shiny brass bell.  Several tapestries depicting various famous dwarven bards hang from the austere timber-and-stone walls.  A dimly lit hallway leads off to the east."
