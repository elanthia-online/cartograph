    "The paving changes from the red brick and black basalt blocks prevalent in front of Andelas' temple to the west to a mix of yellow brick and grey granite blocks in front of the matching wall now bordering the street's north side.  A birchwood gate bearing an enamelled grey shield with a glowing, slit-pupilled sunstone eye set in its center opens in the center of the wall.  A narrow alley opens to the north between Andelas' sandstone wall and the wall of Fash'lo'nae's compound.",
