    "The ceiling and walls to the east have cracked and crumbled under the weight of the solid ground above.  A makeshift brace lies broken off to the side of the passageway.  An elven corpse lies half buried under a large boulder that fell from the ceiling.  Rotten torches and wooden mallets are scattered among the rocky debris."
