    "A steel-footed iron brazier rests in the center of the room, its hazy glow barely enough to illuminate the area.  Faceless stone idols stand shoulder-to-shoulder in a protective formation before the southerly exits.  Two sizeable spheres, one of fire opal and the other copper-hued, are mounted prominently on the south wall and are unmistakable representations of the Tilaok and Makiri moons."
