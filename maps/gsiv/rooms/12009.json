    "It looks as though at one time the tunnel branched off to the west.  Now the tunnel in that direction is filled with rubble that spills out into the north/south aqueduct.  The rubble litters the usually smooth floor of the tunnel, making the footing even more unsure than it already is in the strange lighting conditions.  Overhead, a large crack perhaps two inches wide snakes out of the cave-in and across the ceiling, hinting at more instability above."
