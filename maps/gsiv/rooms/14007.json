  "description": [
    "The curving walls of this room are painted with an intricate mural that depicts the sprawling world of Elanthia.  A circular couch scattered with soft pillows sits in an outward-facing fashion, allowing one to view the mural while relaxing.  Overhead, an elaborate light fixture illuminates both the mural and the room.  A mithglin sign has been affixed to the interior side of a massive stone doorway."
