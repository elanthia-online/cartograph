    "A glaes table sits in a semicircle around the edge of the dais.  Behind the center of the table looms the deep obsidian throne of the Highlord.  Four smaller chairs, one of onyx, one of clear glaes, one of rolaren and one of black ora sit two to either side, making up the five chairs of the Obsidian Council.  An aura of power blankets the room, as if the strength of those who owned the chairs had imbedded itself into the very obsidian."
