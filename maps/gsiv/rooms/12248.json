    "The camp slumbers.  All the soldiers rest soundly in their tents, and even the night sentries have dozed off, chins resting against their chests.  As the seven guardsmen sleep, a man clad in a cloak bearing the symbol of the slumbering army creeps outside the camp, bearing the seven swords of the watchmen.  He gives a nod towards a copse of trees, and out rides a raiding party, thundering into the unprotected camp."
