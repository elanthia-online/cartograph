    "Across the north face of the wall are several steel buffets, each holding a different type of food.  Elven cooks, dressed in crisp white uniforms, rush around replacing any foods that are close to running out.  A good number of soldiers flow through the area as they gaze over the selections, picking up foodstuffs from one buffet or another."
