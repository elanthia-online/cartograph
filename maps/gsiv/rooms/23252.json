    "Warm light illuminates the dark modwir bookshelves lining the walls of this inviting room.  Parchments and books of all shapes and sizes pack the shelves, while a dog-eared journal and an aged vellum scroll lie open on a low wooden table.  Cozy velnalin hide chairs rest beside a sturdy wheeled ladder that provides access to the topmost volumes."
