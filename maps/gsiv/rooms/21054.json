  "description": [
    "Though immersed in the darkness of night, the air retains a dense, moist heat.  No hint of the sky can be seen through the compact leafy canopy, and what little light sneaks through is barely enough to illuminate the slick vegetation and moist loamy ground.  Massive tree roots crisscross the jungle floor, their length mirroring the crosshatching of abundant, leaf-laden branches high above.  Soft dripping sounds echo eerily in the otherwise still air."
