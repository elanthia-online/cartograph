  "description": [
    "Ocean spray glistens on the cobblestone streets as they terminate to the east at the edge of a rocky shoal that circles around to the southern edge of the lane.  A small work house, surrounded by stacked logs, sits at the head of a worn path that leads to the water where workers use pike poles to pull logs out of the water.  Ramps ascend the cliff face, which is lower here than in other areas of the island, allowing other workers to reach the forest at the top."
