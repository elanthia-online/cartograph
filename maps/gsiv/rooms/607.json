    "Bouncing over Sylvar Wey and its surrounding blue-tiled residences, the bridge's glaesine abutments disappear in the darkness below.  Mica-flecked blue granite blocks build the arching expanse and at the crown, a pair of crystal peacocks with tails fanned beautifully twinkle under the nighttime celestial lights.  The hexagonal granite keystone and its nearest neighbors are carved in intricate detail.",
    "Bouncing over Sylvar Wey and its surrounding blue-tiled residences, the bridge's glaesine abutments float above the ground on seemingly invisible bases.  Seethe Naedal is barely visible beyond the fortress spires to the west.  Mica-flecked blue granite blocks build the arching expanse and at the crown, a pair of crystal peacocks perch with tails fanned beautifully.  The hexagonal granite keystone and its nearest neighbors are carved in intricate detail.",
    "Arching over Sylvar Wey and its surrounding blue-tiled residences, the white marble span is anchored to the ground with carved silvery blue stone braces.  Each column along the bridge is carefully fluted, while overhead is a pure silver mosaic.  Staggered lanterns set between the columns light the area with a pale blue glow.",
