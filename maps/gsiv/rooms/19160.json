    "A few sailors browse over the goods in the room but appear to be spending more time keeping an eye on the customers.  A carved monir seaman's trunk has been placed next to a long wooden armor rack, which has been hung with a rum-splashed sign.  Some shield hooks overlook a tall metal shield stand, and a velvet-draped sword table is equidistant from both exits."
