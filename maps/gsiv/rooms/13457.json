  "description": [
    "Stone steps have been carved into the face of a steep hill, while a pebbled lane leads away to the west.  Mounds of white and red flowers have been planted on either side of the steps, and adding their luminous color to the darkness of the shady glen.  A wind chime hangs on the lower branch of one of the oaks at the side of the lane, and breezes coax a soft song from it.",
