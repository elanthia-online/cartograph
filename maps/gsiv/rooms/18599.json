    "Delicate arched niches have been carved out of the walls.  In each sits a small, beautiful statue of one of the Lords and Ladies of Liabo, looking out over those who have come to pray.  A number of kneeling pillows and padded benches have been placed strategically around the room, and a censer of soft incense hangs from the ceiling."
