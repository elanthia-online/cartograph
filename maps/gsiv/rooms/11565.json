  "description": [
    "Miles of cordage is carefully stowed away here.  A huge length of hawser thicker than a giantman's thigh is coiled in one corner of the slanting deck.  Oft-spliced ropes for the braces, clewlines and other rigging are hung on stout pegs.  Fine lengths of light but sturdy cord for hoisting ensigns and flags are gathered in figure-eight loops."
