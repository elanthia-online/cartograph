    "The trail crosses a small stream coursing through its mossy bed and gurgling as it rushes past boulders in its path.  Silvery painted ferns grow around the rocks lining the stream's banks, their mottled leaves coated with spray from the creek's assault on the offending rocks.  Frogs sing in abandon, hidden in night's shadows.",
    "The trail crosses a small stream coursing through its mossy bed and throwing up sparkling drops of water as it rushes past boulders in its path.  Silvery painted ferns grow around the rocks lining the stream's banks, their mottled leaves coated with droplets from the spray.  A few animal tracks are visible in patches of silt and mud between the stones."
