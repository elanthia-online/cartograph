  "description": [
    "Although few signs of the maritime heritage of this town remain, it seems the law is a throwback.  The Captain's Quarter is sparsely outfitted with a map station gracing one wall and a large bench resting at the foot of a neatly made bunk.  The floor is made of rough wood planks.  In one corner you notice a hatchway, large enough to allow a giantman to slip through easily.  However, the large lock which secures it makes you pause to think twice about investigating any further."
