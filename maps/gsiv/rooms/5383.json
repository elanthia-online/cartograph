    "The woods, grasses, and underbrush turn to brown, then to black and dead as the path progresses east toward an old, rickety house.  The house looks strangely out of place here, its fine craftsmanship obvious even though it is now dilapidated.  No plants grow anywhere near the house, and animals seem to keep their distance."
