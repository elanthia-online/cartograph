    "A light brown granite table shaped much as the letter J lying on its side rests near the eastern wall of the tavern.  Two rounded, grey marble supports hold the table aloft, allowing a number of chairs to snuggle in closely.  The straight portion of the J carved into various rings, with the carvings cleverly suggesting rope wrappings and sections of wood.  The curved tip of the J has been painted black, and two bumps arise from the top surface of the table near that end."
