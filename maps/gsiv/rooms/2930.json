  "description": [
    "Delicate snowflakes dance in the air, swirling.  A large boulder has broken off from the mountainside and now sits upon the shelf, blocking the trail.  Crowned with a layer of snow, the boulder nearly touches the slope rising up at its side.  Only a slim crevice between the two allows passage beyond."
