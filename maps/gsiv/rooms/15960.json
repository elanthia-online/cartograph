    "The snow-covered meadow is bordered on the north and east by a thick stand of pines.  Here and there, enough space is hewn from the trees to accommodate cottages or sheds.  Large walls of firewood are laced through the trunks between the houses, cut and stacked neatly.  A trail leads away to the east, twisting and turning so that it is quickly lost to sight."
