    "White marble walls encapsulate this small entry room.  The interior of the building is blocked by a heavy oak door.  Twin torches are affixed to the wall on either side of the door and cast their light on the room, bathing the contents in a golden glow.  A low table near the entry is covered with a scarlet cloth, on which rests several small trinkets that glitter in the torchlight.  Wandering the room is a darkly robed illusionist, who scours the area with a harsh gaze."
