    "The ledge protrudes from a sheltered niche tucked into the end of the ravine, a spot of relative safety above the piles of jagged rocks below.  The blackened remains of a long-dead torch stand in a crude sconce carved from the solid rock of the ravine wall, and mist creeps down from the overhanging edge of the moors above like an ethereal waterfall, dissipating in the still air and dampening the cold stone."
