    "Cobwebs liberally hang from the corners of the room, and the lingering smell of dried herbs and sickly sweet flowers hangs in the air.  Collections of misshapen candles lend a wavering, moody light to the area, the faint glow illuminating the numerous boxes that lay open amid stacks of old, mildew-ridden books."
