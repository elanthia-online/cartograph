    "A faint trail passes through some tall grasses that softly swish in the cool night breeze.  A few soft chirrups signal the presence of night-hunting rodents, which scavenge the grassland for fallen seed.  High overhead, the stars twinkle brightly, only accentuating the dark stillness of the forest.",
    "A faint trail passes through the tall grass that covers a bee-loud glade at the foot of a high hill.  The insects fill the sky with their frenzied display, yet seem totally disinterested in the presence of other creatures.  As a result, they make easy pickings for the large birds that hover on the fringes of the glade, occasionally darting out for a quick kill."
