    "The road slants sharply here in a zig-zag pattern, leading to a strange structure half-cast in shadow further northeast.  Swirls of grey mist dance along the glassy surfaces of stagnant black pools upon the ground, and faint ripples play across them with every ambiguous sound that echoes about the surroundings.  Moonlight drifts through small gaps in the walls between buildings, breaking up the large patches of darkness in an uneasy fashion.",
