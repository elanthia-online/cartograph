    "A wide slough spreads out to the west.",
    "A wide slough spreads out to the west.  The marshy area has been created by the runoff from the upper sections of the farmlands to the north, northwest and northeast, and the blocking action of the stone wall that runs along the farmlands' south border.  The soil becomes too wet for turnip plants at the edge of the slough, and the cattails and bulrushes make certain that any turnips valiantly attempting to survive get choked off mercilessly."
