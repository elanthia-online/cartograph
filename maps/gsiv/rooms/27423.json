    "Bright yellow curtains drape over the glass panes of the windows, filtering the bright light of the bonfire and casting the room partially in shadow.  A large wooden bunk takes up one side of the room, a rainbow-colored quilt folded neatly at the end of the bed.  A large leather chair sits in the corner of the room next to a rosewood dresser."
