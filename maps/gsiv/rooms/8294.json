  "description": [
    "The floor of this hut is almost obscured by strands, nooses and coils of spidersilk rope.  The deceptively delicate cord is strong and unyielding to your touch.  Recently gathered webs and spools of spun spidersilk fill the large willow baskets that line the room, awaiting transformation into beautiful but merciless bonds.  A roughhewn wooden contraption resembling a giant spinning wheel occupies the entire far wall."
