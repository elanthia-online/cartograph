    "This narrow cramped hallway is just an extension of that to the south.  The stones in the walls, floor and ceiling continue to be ill-fitted and uneven.  The prisonlike quality of this area is heightened by the drab bare wall which abruptly ends the hallway to the north. Six identical wooden doors lead off this hallway."
