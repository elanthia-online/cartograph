    "The living quarters for the keeper of the lighthouse now is transformed into a comfy den for weary fishermen to rest their sea legs and grab a bite to eat.  Bulky fishing nets with glaes floaters hang from the wall.  A faint odor of sea salt and fish invade your senses as fishermen and merchants walk by.  A large oaken table rests along the north side of the lounge.  An arched opening in the east wall serves as the entrance to the stairwell."
