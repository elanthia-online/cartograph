  "description": [
    "Two private rooms are opposite each other on this narrow hall, both with sturdy and latching doors.  The walls and ceiling are bare.  Nothing but the old wooden walls decorate the passage.  Dust from the rotting wood of the walls and ceiling floats through the air.  The clinking of glass and mumbling from the patrons of the bar drifts in from the tavern."
