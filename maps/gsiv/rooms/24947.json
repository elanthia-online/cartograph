    "Separated off from the main gallery is a smaller, private workshop, whose dark walnut-stained floor matches the straight beam ceiling above.  Set on the wainscoted walls is a long cork notice board with several order parchments attached.  A pair of rollers from a silver-edged lacquered bolt display have been removed and set on a marble-topped sturdy wooden worktable.  Underneath the worktable sits a series of white ash shoe forms, well-organized compared to the remainder of the room."
