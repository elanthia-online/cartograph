  "description": [
    "Crushed white seashells spill into the small clearing from the slender footpath that winds its gentle way westward through the encroaching foliage.  Wild vines and broad-leafed vegetation have been cleared from a wide, cobblestone courtyard.  Copper-banded barrels line the court on opposing sides of a large stucco wall at the eastern end of this clearing.  A large sandstone archway sits at the center of the whitewashed wall, and a thin reed mat has been laid across the threshold."
