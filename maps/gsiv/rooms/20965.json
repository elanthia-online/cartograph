    "Here at the edge of the river, the ground is soft and mushy, and a thin blanket of freshly fallen leaves covers many other layers of dead foliage in varying stages of decay.  Ideal for insects, the moist surface is teeming with life.  Ants scurry back and forth, and all sorts of worms wriggle about, digging holes throughout the damp ground."
