    "The flow of guildsmen, merchants, and shoppers is constant, moving northwest toward the North Market and south toward the East Bridge.  A bronze bow hangs above the entrance of a shop on the southeast corner of the intersection, and across from it a simple two story house occupies the intersection's northeast corner."
