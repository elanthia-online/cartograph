  "description": [
    "Rickety wooden boards have been clumsily nailed together into a makeshift fence that encloses this area into a private backyard.  The ground is covered in overlapping tiny pawprints, chewed bones, and randomly dug holes, leaving the footing over the mud treacherous in some places.  A lopsided shelter made of wooden planks is set in one corner, while a round steel bowl full of raw bloody meat sits next to a similar bowl of water in the opposite corner.  A discolored wooden door leading back into the shack is the only way out."
