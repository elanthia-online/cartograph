    "Propped against one wall, a pile of arm-length, cut wooden logs waits patiently for some unknown use.  Bound together with thick twine, the dozen or so pieces of wood might serve as stout torches, although their exact purpose remains unclear.  The dull hum of falling water moves through the tunnel, its presence noticeable, but not overwhelming."
