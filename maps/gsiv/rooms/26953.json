  "description": [
    "Towering over the garden walls, an enormous ironwood tree stretches its broad fingers towards the sky as if reaching for the apex of the Needle of Pentas.  Broad leaves of a pale green hue wreathe the arboreal giant, while small, blood red blossoms decorate its lower boughs, which are laden with tiny prismatic baubles.  A low stone bench rests within crimson gravel along the southeastern bend of the cobbled pathway."
