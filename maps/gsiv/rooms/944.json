    "A crumbling pile of stone chips and loose gravel leans against one of the stone walls, attesting to the transitory nature of some portions of the pass.  Bits of rock and loose debris clog the passage as they trickle down the sides of the man-sized pile, making forward movement a tedious endeavor.  In the distance, a muffled sound seems to vibrate through the stone walls."
