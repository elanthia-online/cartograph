  "description": [
    "Despite its humble entrance between two stacks of crates, the arena's antechamber thrives with frenetic activity.  Champions push and shove each other for a glimpse of the latest information on a painted wooden leaderboard while seedy lenders prey on those recently divorced from their hard-earned marks.  All of this occurs beneath the low roof formed by the deck above, in an atmosphere tainted by the smoke of cigars and pleasure herbs."
