    "The end of the hallway is highlighted by a light-colored stone mosaic of a snowman, the creature inset with thin oak branches for arms and orange enamel for a nose.  The snowman sits upon a hill of ivory snow with a yellow-colored sun situated high above the scene.  A thin tile-inset rivulet indicates that the rounded statue would not survive for long."
