    "The street leading past the curved bulk of the amphitheater is a mix of small homes and shops.  Many have a theatrical bent, with a few hawking costumes and one, its wares advertised on an oversized silk banner, seeming to be selling props.  Amidst the gaudiness of the collected wares, the buildings themselves are all decidedly Illistimi in style -- white marble, fluted columns and octagonal stained glass windows are common.",
    "The street leading up to the amphitheater is nearly deserted at this hour.  A lone minstrel sits nearby, strumming his lute and softly singing a mournful tune about love long lost.  An empty alemug rests on the ground beside him, and at his feet, an upturned hat bereft of donations.",
    "Jugglers and jongleurs occupy the cobblestoned streets near the amphitheater, entertaining passersby with their antics and songs.  Several have hats set out on the ground to catch coins from appreciative donors.  Soaring above the fray, the spire of a belltower glints in the light."
