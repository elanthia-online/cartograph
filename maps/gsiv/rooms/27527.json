    "As this small room's sole light source, a stove in the corner emanates heat as its flickering flames cast dancing shadows across drakar-lined walls.  An oval fog-streaked mirror rests in the corner.  Slender ironwood racks with mithril shelving are installed adjacent to a mithril-banded door."
