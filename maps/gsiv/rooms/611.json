  "description": [
    "Most of the var is deserted at this hour, only the occasional passerby hurrying through on the way to his or her destination.  A large ornate granite building stands back from the var, its stone pillars engraved with elegant dahcres.  Small fierce gargoyles hover above door and window embrasures, guarding the structure with gleaming sapphire eyes and toothy grins.  Several torches light the walk leading to the massive structure.",
    "Elves hurry up and down the var, each intent upon his or her own destination.  Here and there, a few groups have stopped to chat with one another, and still others wave and shout cheerfully to friends as they rush onward.  A large ornate granite building stands back from the var, its stone pillars engraved with elegant dahcres.  Small fierce gargoyles hover above door and window embrasures, guarding the structure with gleaming sapphire eyes and toothy grins.",
    "The intersection of wey and var is also an intersection of two neighborhoods -- a rough and tumble area surrounding the airship docks, with its influx of foreigners and foreign cultures, and a humble but distinctly elven residential neighborhood.  The buildings here, at the juncture of the disparate areas, are a mix of the two groups."
