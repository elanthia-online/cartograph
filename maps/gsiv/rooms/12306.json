    "A large, fancy rosewood desk sits in the middle of this room, a cushioned velvet-covered chair placed precisely behind it.  On the wall behind the desk is a large portrait of an elven woman, the colors bright despite its evident age.  A large silver chandelier hangs overhead, its myriad of candles snuffed for the day, while a carved rosewood arch leads farther into the shop.",
