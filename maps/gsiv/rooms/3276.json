    "The passage opens up into a large chamber with additional passages leading off in several other directions.  There is a familiar smell about the place, but no indication of its source.  Chains, whips, and large harnesses are secured to a wooden rack along the east side of the room.  The rest of the area is taken up by several devices that may have been used to torture captives.  Along the walls, several rusted sets of manacles hang lifelessly, awaiting yet another victim."
