  "description": [
    "A wide, flat clearing stretches out here atop Jag Hill, rising from the bog and providing a much needed break from the damp and soggy conditions down the hill to the south.  A ring of stones in the center of the clearing contains the burned out remains of many campfires.  Large stones, crates, and small barrels have been arranged around the fire pit, providing convenient resting places while drying out.  To the north, the terrain flattens out, but is covered by dense brush."
