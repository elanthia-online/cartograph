    "The path meanders into a small grassy clearing in the trees that is totally surrounded by trees and a thick growth of prickly brambles.  A ray of light descends from the sky and into the center of the tiny meadow, illuminating the broken stump of a modwir tree, where the steady sound of humming indicates the presence of a busy hive of bees."
