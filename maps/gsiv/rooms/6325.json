  "description": [
    "Scattered around the room are colorful carpets with thick borders around the edges.  In the center of the shop, a gold veined marble counter holds a collection of objects, including a tiered jewelry stand.  Small shelves along the back wall hold an assortment of magical vessels.  On the opposite side of the shop are two tables, one holding figurines and the other holding miscellaneous items.  Nestled between the tables is a crystal stand resembling blocks of ice pieced together to create different levels upon which items are carefully arranged."
