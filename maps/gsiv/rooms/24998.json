  "description": [
    "Rusted metal pikes thrust out from the dry, brittle ground, the tall shafts of wood and steel piercing through the dust-filled sky.  A variety of skulls adorn each pike, both human and animal, each one stripped and painted in the same clay that blows across the road with every random gust of wind.  The macabre display is encircled by spiked lengths of wire, the makeshift fence littered with tufts of fur and flesh."
