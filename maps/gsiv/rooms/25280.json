    "Softly glowing white gems are ensconced along the walls of this room, providing a cheering light.  Nearly every wall is covered with carved fel scroll racks, leaving little room for a locked weapon case.  A burnished fel desk claims one corner, its surface covered with papers and a well-worn book.  Near the desk rests an inviting black leather armchair."
