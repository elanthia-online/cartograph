    "Stands and dummies draped with the sturdy clothing necessary for such a cold climate are arranged near the windows, while a blazing matte black iron stove glows with red coals exuding warmth.",
    "A small sign hangs over a series of dummies and stands with several outfits on display.  A pairing of suggested outfits hang on either side of the dressing room.  Sitting beneath a narrow frosted window is a matte black iron stove, exuding warmth throughout the shop.  A painted mural of Icemule Trace hangs above a small wooden door leading deeper into the shop.",
    "Warmed by a halfling-sized cast iron stove, this room features several mannequins in various outfits.  A small sign hangs near the dressing room, which is flanked by elegant fur coats and leather jackets.  Pristine white polar bear furs, silvery arctic wolverine pelts, and shimmering ivory snowcat skins adorn the walls.  A freshly retouched mural of Icemule Trace hangs above a small wooden door leading deeper into the shop."
