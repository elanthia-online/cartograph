    "The wey is empty at this hour of the night, the cottages mostly dark save for a glowing lantern here and there.  From the window of a nearby cottage, you hear a young woman giving voice to a sweet, sad song.",
    "An elderly, bespectacled elf struggles to maintain his hold on a pile of scrolls that seems determined to wriggle out of his grasp.  Walking southwest in the direction of the library, he seems completely unaware of his surroundings and he blunders and bumps into his fellow travelers.  From the window of a nearby cottage, you hear a young woman giving voice to a sweet, sad song.",
    "A series of grandiose marble villas line both sides of the wey, each with a diminutive cookie-cutter rectangle of manicured green grass.  The oversized homes vary in the subject matter of their pedimental carvings, but are alike in their basic design -- lit silver lanterns, fluted columns, arched doorways and a single bed of white flowers next to each step.",
