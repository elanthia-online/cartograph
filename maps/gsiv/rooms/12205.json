    "A long line of robed monks walks solemnly, fading off into the distance.  They seem to be traveling toward the largest mountain of a set which runs across the distant horizon.  Two bursts of flame shoot up from an opening in the mountain occasionally, illuminating a skull-shaped castle and a line of supplicants several miles long moving towards it."
