    "Everything in this small shop gleams softly in the candlelight flickering from a crystal chandelier hanging overhead.  A row of glaes-paned cases lines one wall, the first holding a collection of gems and the second displaying a diamond necklet.  A carved wooden counter rests opposite.  A carpeted stairway leads up to the second floor of the shop."
