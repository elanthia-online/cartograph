  "description": [
    "Climbing the perpetually slick stairway demands attention and care, as the fall from this height would surely end badly on the jagged, black rocks below.  A dusting of ground black coral, lacquer-sealed across each board, gives at least some purchase underfoot.  Swirling mists and thick, grey fog make ascertaining safe footing difficult, even with bright and colorful lanterns swinging wildly overhead in the fierce winds coming off the nighttime sea.",
