    "Brightly lit by globe-encased candles on a caribou antler chandelier, this room is enclosed in lacquered pine walls that portray a series of artfully rendered sketches.  Crystal shards native to the Icemule underground reflect and refract the ambient light from above.  An overstuffed couch faces a blackened rock fireplace, while priceless artifacts gleam from within a prominent glass display case above the mantle.  An imposing angular oak desk in one corner, a curt aelotoi administrator seated behind it, conspicuously displays a roughly hewn pine statuette and holds papers, quills, and inkwells for penning notes to the mayor."
