    "What remains of the cobblestone road ventures northeast and southwest, unconcerned with the struggle for survival occurring on either side of it.  Thousands of frogs have clambered up on the cobblestones, escaping a threat unknown, only to die in the exposed conditions.  Their bodies have decayed to the point where all that remains are flattened, leathery pieces of eyeless amphibian stuck to the cobblestones or compressed into the cracks between them."
