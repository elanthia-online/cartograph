  "description": [
    "The shop of the ancient archmage Pherantyr seems out of step with the times, or rather timeless in its decor.  All the shelves are lined with items gathered from the remote corners of the world, each with an aura of strong magic about it.   Near the back, a dark shimmering veil covers what must be a back workroom."
