    "Flickering shadows dance rigidly across the stone walls of this room where a small forge houses bright red coals wreathed in licking flames.  A wooden structure sits next to a trough of murky water and houses all manner of useful tools, including some ceramic crucibles.  Several mining apprentices wander in and out of the area."
