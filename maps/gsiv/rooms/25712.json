    "Frosted globes housing votive candles are strung from thin chains along the ceiling and provides a steady supply of illumination.  Bright white tiles create a colorful backsplash in the space between the counter and the cupboards that line the walls, their glossy faces painted with herbs.  Surrounded by high-back chairs, a long mahogany table is dressed with a bright white linen tablecloth and sits in the center of the room.  A painted pale blue door stands open near the kitchen's entry."
