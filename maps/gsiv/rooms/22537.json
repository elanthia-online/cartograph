    "Silver mesh drapes in swaths across the gold satin ceiling of the pavilion, the walls braced by shiny gold-painted rods.  A spindly copper earring tree branches over a highly varnished wood table.  Other wares hang from an array of thin copper hooks that dangle from the criss-crossed gold latticework above.  One corner of the pavilion has been draped off by a floor-to-ceiling swath of gauzy gold silk."
