  "description": [
    "The ground rises here, forming an oval mound.  The foliage is as thick and dense as elsewhere, but clearly not as old as in other parts of the jungle.  The mound is pockmarked with small depressions, as if attempts had been made to burrow into the mound at some point in the distant past.  The high-pitched humming of gnats can be heard throughout the area."
