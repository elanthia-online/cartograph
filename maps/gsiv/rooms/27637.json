  "description": [
    "A myriad of crates and barrels containing hard liquors, ales, and beers line two of the walls, securely propped atop oak shelves reinforced with mithglin.  Some of the barrels are caked in dust and look to have not been touched for years, presumably to allow the contents inside to age appropriately.  The air is laden with an unmistakable scent of fermenting grain and fruit."
