    "An immense, seamless slab of polished dark green, umber-striated granite forms the primary horizontal work surface for this utilitarian room.  A thick-walled, molded clay crucible rests upon an ash-filled forge.  Dirty canvas workgloves crafted with thick leather palms have been left on the granite worksurface, along with small cupels and tongs for handling heated metals.  Collections of hammered gears, hinged latches, and various fasteners are stocked and labeled in individual jars."
