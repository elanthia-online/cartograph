    "Green liquid oozes up from the floor to mingle with the water flowing through from the northeast.  As it disperses, it colors the water a light emerald green and imparts a glow to the stream that bathes the floor and walls with a dim luminescence.  Thus the tunnel to the northeast, sans liquid, is shrouded in darkness, while the tunnel to the south is eerily lit from below."
