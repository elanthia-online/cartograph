  "description": [
    "In the center of the dark and gloomy bazaar stands the towering black facade of a citadel, its shape looming large over the square.  Wisps of pale, white smoke swirl about the citadel's highest spire as eerie moans emanate from beyond its curved doors.  A group of ghastly figures kneel in a circle along the street, hauntingly chanting as they offer praise to the black fortress."
