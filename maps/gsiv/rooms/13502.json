    "Fluted white marble columns enclose the area in a wide circle, marking the edges of the building itself.  The stark white of the surroundings is broken only by the massive circle of vivid lapis lazuli upon the floor, its center inset with ivory in the shape of a simple dagger.  A large statue of a slender elven woman stands to the north, the dagger she holds upraised in her hands bathed in the soft, pale moonlight filtering through the large oculus in the domed ceiling.",
