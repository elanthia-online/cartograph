    "A bucket attached to a frayed rope sits on a low stone well in the middle of this corner of the village square.  Carefully laid cobblestones run north and east past small shops.  A glimpse of a bazaar can be spied through the gap between two empty houses, their fronts identical but for the color of the doors."
