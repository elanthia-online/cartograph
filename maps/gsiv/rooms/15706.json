    "The rounded chamber walls reflect a light emerald shade from sunlight passing through tinted skylights in fragmented beams.  The light imbues the room with an unearthly emerald glow.  An altar of black ora is positioned below, in the precise center of the room, and its base is wreathed in wisps of haze drifting down from the frozen architecture.  Spread out across the ceiling's arc is a carved serpent, its wingspan enormous and its languid coils emanating a quiet sense of malice.",
