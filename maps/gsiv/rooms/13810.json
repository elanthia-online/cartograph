    "Tall dunes rise from the grass, their sides dotted with hardy wildflowers.  The hillside stretches away to the north, angling east to border the lake in a sheer cliff.  Within the protection of the beach and bluff sit a few cottages, constructed in a quaint style that melds gracefully with the dramatic landscape."
