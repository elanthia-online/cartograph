  "description": [
    "Trios of wrought iron horn cleats are arranged down the length of the pier in alternating patterns between support posts fitted with thick cords of bright azure rope, the latter of which forms a barrier designed to protect against a fall into the ocean beyond.  Saltwater spray from the bouncing waves glistens in the ambient light, while dark blue diamonds painted onto the wooden floorboards label slips 6 through 10 as being nearby.  A discolored windsock flutters as the seaborne breeze tugs it."
