    "Three bloated and decaying orcas, likely a mama, papa, and baby, rest together in shallow pools between jagged peaks.  A putrid stench emits from each, as gases of decomposition seep through open wounds and deteriorating body cavities.  The baby's face and eyes have been picked clean by scavengers and, beneath the leathery exteriors, writhing hagfish can be seen devouring the choice flesh.  The treacherous nighttime path has been made moreso by a slick coating of blood, blubber, and a rancid, slimy ooze.",
    "Three sun-bleached skeletal orcas, likely a mama, papa, and baby, rest together in shallow pools between jagged peaks.  Bits of leathery, black and white hide cling in scattered patches across each creature's bony structures, as if refusing to surrender its former identity.  The smallest skeleton is missing its head and much of its ribcage, and trails of bone shards litter the treacherous slope below."
