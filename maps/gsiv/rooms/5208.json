    "A natural stone pier juts into the surf, the rocks of the pier being more resistant to the pounding of the ocean than the rest of the shore along here.  Sand crabs gather amongst broken seashells near the edge of the surf and the rocks of the pier.  The noise of waves crashing against the pier is deafening."
