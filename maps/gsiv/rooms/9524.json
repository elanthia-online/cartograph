    "Cascading downhill from the southeast, the bones form a small bone lake hemmed in by granite walls on the east, southwest, west, and northwest.  Eventually the incoming bones become too much for the area, and they slide off to the northeast.  Slender dry stalagmites dot the bone lake, their pointed fingers reaching up toward the gloom-shrouded ceiling.  In one small area, several stalactites hang down, attempting to reach their counterparts.  The absence of moisture will doom the attempt."
