  "description": [
    "Brilliant yellow illumination trickles into the passage from the west, while to the east it perceptively darkens.  Fresh, white paint decorates the tunnel proving that some sort of maintenance takes place here on a fairly regular basis.  The odd sound of mechanical whirs mingles with the sound of running water, though their source is not evident anywhere in this section of the passage."
