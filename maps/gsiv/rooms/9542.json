    "The sea of bones ends abruptly at a flat, black granite wall.  Piled high against the far wall and spilling back toward the west, the sloping bones make it difficult to stand in this room.  The perpetual smell of death and decay culminates into an overpowering, almost palpable stench in this nearly closed-off room."
