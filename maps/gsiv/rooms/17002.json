    "Only the heavy limestone walls of this spacious chamber seem to match the simple, unadorned halls outside the door.  A warm glow emanates from ornate lamps set in the corners, their fragrant oils filling the room with a subtle scent of exotic spices.  Thick layers of carpets woven in geometric patterns cover the floor, which bears no furniture but for piles of cushions upholstered in rich satins and silks, and flowing silk curtains striped in red, blue, and gold cover one wall."
