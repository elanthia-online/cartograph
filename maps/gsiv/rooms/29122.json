  "description": [
    "Smooth stone walls provide a sense of security to visitors and merchants that frequent the small exchange booth that is under the constant guard of burly officers.  Standing behind a tall desk, a bow-legged exchange clerk diligently works to help customers with their exchanges.  Occasionally, he pauses to indicate a gold-inlaid thanot sign that hangs on the wall."
