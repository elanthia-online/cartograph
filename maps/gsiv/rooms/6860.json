    "This cozy room has been done in shades of rich red.  Crimson curtains with tasselled ropes cover the windows, complemented by the deep red comforter resting on the bed.  Cream colored sheets peek out from under the heavy quilt, and a small cream spiral rug rests next to the bed.  A redwood nightstand finishes the look, standing just under the window."
