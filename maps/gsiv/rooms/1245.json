    "Illumination from smoky oil lamps reflects off polished glaes walls etched with delicate runes, making pale shadows appear to dance in the flickering light.  To one side of the room sits an oak clothes rack with some stuff hanging on it.",
    "Pale blue enamel frames various mirrors and paintings along the ivory-colored walls of the boutique, the color scheme matching the scalloped rugs beneath a lacquered linden armoire and a riveted tan leather trunk.  The subtle fragrance of vanilla-tinged lavender drifts upwards from a pair of blown glass censers hung along either side of a tall ribbon-entwined rack, the pale grey wisps dissipating as they curl against the linden-planked ceiling."
