    "A thin rug of vivid crimson spreads across the cold black marble of this hall, and the walls are carved with detailed images of large felines waiting patiently in ambush.  Golden claw-topped columns tower above, the structures casting long shadows that waver with the faintest flicker of torchlight.  An uneasy silence permeates the area, and the very air seems charged with tension."
