  "description": [
    "Branches of massive oak trees on all sides form a canopy over the hidden path, drowning out most of the dim moonlight.  Odd geometrical markings have been carved in the bark of some of the trees, and the cry of a hawk from a perch somewhere above announces your presence.  Heavy brambles and underbrush conceal the west end of the path."
