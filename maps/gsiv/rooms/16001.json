    "Finely dressed elven maidens serve patrons seated at small wooden tables pushed against the walls.  Padded brass stools surround a massive circular oak bar where barrels and casks of spirits are protectively guarded by a black-clad halfling barkeep.  A derelict table occupies the dimly lit corner to the southeast opposite a candlelit hallway to the west, while a heavy cedar double door leads outside."
