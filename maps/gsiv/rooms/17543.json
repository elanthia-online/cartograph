    "A potbelly stove occupies one corner of this cozy room, casting a warm glow on the rough hewn oak walls.  Some colorful rugs are strewn across the sanded floor.  Wide benches, rocking chairs, and soft cushions crowd this room, offering rest and conversation, while large glass windows provide clear views in all directions.  Various herbs and flowers have been hung from the ceiling to dry, creating a rich, woodsy aroma through the room.  A small ladder, leading to a large skylight above, leans against the wall next to a round maoral door"
