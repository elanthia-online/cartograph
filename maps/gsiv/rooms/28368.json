    "Loosely packed dirt crunches under your feet, some of it darkly stained by a viscous substance whose nature is better left undetermined.  A thick iron sconce mounted beside the mithril barred door holds a single pine torch, and eerie shadows play upon the rough walls behind various cruel-looking devices.  On the far wall, a pair of glaes shackles hangs menacingly, awaiting the next occupant."
