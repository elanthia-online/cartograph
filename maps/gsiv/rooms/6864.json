    "A wood-framed bed stands in a corner, covered in fresh linens and thick down comforters.  Next to it is a small nightstand, providing a place for a clean bowl of wash water and a drawer for small necessities.  Dark curtains cover the windows to keep the light at bay until the room's occupant is ready to face it."
