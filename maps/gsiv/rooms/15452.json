    "The rear wall of this semi-circular room is dominated by an arched stained-glass window with shafts of muted moonlight shining through, casting dancing patterns across the mahogany floor.  Immediately below, a fancifully carved haon desk stands turned at a slight angle atop a woven Loenthran silk rug, with a large chusioned chair sitting directly behind it.  To either side, a pair of laquered fel bookcases stands against the curved golden oak walls."
