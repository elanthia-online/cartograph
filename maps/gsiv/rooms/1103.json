  "description": [
    "A narrow causeway of basalt rock leads between the edge of the plateau to the southwest and a wide, parallel crevice to the northeast.  The fierce wind, whirling and gusting, threatens to push you off the plateau's edge should your balance fail.  The fall would not be pleasant.  Several hundred feet straight down from the edge, piles of jagged rocks gleam dully in the moonlight, grinning rows of sharp stone teeth that eagerly await a plummeting body.",
