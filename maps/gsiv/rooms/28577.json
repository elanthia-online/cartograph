    "Precariously stacked with all manner of dishes, pots, and pans, a low sky blue cabinet towers over the oak table and its matching pair of chairs in the far corner of the home.  Overstuffed chairs of dusty mauve, each flanked by round side tables, face a large stone fireplace and form a privacy wall with their tall backs that separates the living and sleeping spaces.  An ample bed covered in a patchwork quilt of burgundy rests its headboard against the furthest wall from the entry and is companion to a brown lacquered dresser."
