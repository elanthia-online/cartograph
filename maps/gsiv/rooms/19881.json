    "Sunlight from high windows touches the polished limestone walls, revealing veins of subtle color within them.  Prayer mats on the floor are simple in design, but luxuriously textured.  A small pool is carved into the native stone floor, its waters so still that the merest breath would distort the pool's mirror-bright surface."
