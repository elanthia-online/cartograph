    "The poorly kept road emerges onto a swampy plain to the northeast and delves into the forest to the west.  Cattails attempt to push the wooded area back, while oaks and maples lead the assault in the other direction.  The constant droning of unseen insects emanates from the swamp.  Here, at the forest's edge, the moon shines down brightly on the surrounding area.  The warm night air raises the humidity, and a rather foul odor drifts in from the moist areas.",
