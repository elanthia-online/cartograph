    "The northern edge of the trail is crowded by the sheer cliff, leaving no room for trees to grow.  To the south, a thick grove of maples shade the gentle downward slope of the hillside.  Large icicles hanging from the cliff face dig into the snow, as if pillars of ice meant to support the heavy wall of stone."
