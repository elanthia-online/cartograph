    "A series of steps leads down from a large stone archway into a long, narrow chamber built under the earth.  Large timbers line the walls and support the earthen ceiling above a dirt floor.  A broken goat cart lies discarded and dust-covered in one corner, joined in the opposite corner by several empty crates.  The roars of jungle trolls reverberate faintly from the direction of the ceiling."
