    "In some areas, such as this one, it seems as if there are more rocks than turnips.",
    "In some areas, such as this one, it seems as if there are more rocks than turnips.  Large chunks of granite, slightly smoothed and rounded from the wind's erosive action, litter the area.  Their presence causes the turnip rows to twist and turn in order to use the maximum soil area possible.  The rocks are large enough that they defy easy removal, so the farmer has adapted.  If the rocks provide any benefit at all to the area, it is in the form of a low windbreak."
