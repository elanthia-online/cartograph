    "Evidence of a fire chars the hardened and packed dirt floor just below a hole in the ceiling.  The remains of many creatures and species are piled on the floor, the rot adding an awful smell to the cavernous area.  A rusted iron tub is pushed up against the eastern wall -- a malignant sickness permeates the area and radiates into the air, which appears to be coming from the tub."
