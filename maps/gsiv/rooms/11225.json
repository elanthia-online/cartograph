    "You stand in front of the burnt out remains of one of the towers that used to guard the walls.  To judge from what you can see, it most likely stood several stories tall, although there is little left above the first floor now.  It would seem that most of the upper floors simply vanished or the stones were hauled away at some later time, as there is relatively little debris scattered around."
