    "Two massive chairs rest on a small dais to the east, one splintered and shoved aside to reveal a large trapdoor behind the pair.  Large purple and gold banners hang from the ceiling and walls, moldy and torn.  A small balcony extends from the eastern wall, offering a view of the slopes of the Upper Krag."
