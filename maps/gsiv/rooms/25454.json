  "description": [
    "Neatly arranged with a lineup of colorful miniature bottles, the entire back wall is fashioned from a set of polished ebonwood racks.  Well-featured in the foreground of the room are a wide-set spalted maple cabinet and a stately carved cedar stand stocked with fabric wares.  The walls are interspersed with scintillating bronze and copper tendrils woven into the dark woodwork, highlighting the warm glow of several glass-domed beeswax candles that are alight about the shop."
