    "A black basalt obelisk is imbedded in the hilltop and stands like a shadow against the night sky.  Just to the north, at the very crest of the hill, rises a circular tower of granite blocks.  A scraggly hawthorn tree grows out from a ledge to the south, clinging with spindly roots to an outthrust stone.",
