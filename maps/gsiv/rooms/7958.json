  "description": [
    "This room is the most civilized of the lot.  Primitive rugs are spread on the floor, and the room is nearly orderly.  Lumpy clay bowls line the walls, but from the strange and often revolting smells coming from them, you aren't sure you want to know what is stored in them.  Thin, strangely marked bones spill out from a sack onto a small table."
