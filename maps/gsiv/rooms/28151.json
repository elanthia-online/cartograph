    "Atop the mizzenmast, above crisp white sails, a large white flag bearing a midnight blue heron flies in the air.  Dark blue velvet-padded benches line the chrome-railed square back of the stern, surrounding a small marble-topped bar secured to the deck.  Standing at the center of the aftcastle, a waist-high chrome frame supports a crystal steerage globe.  A chrome-handled hatch offers access to the cargo hold below."
