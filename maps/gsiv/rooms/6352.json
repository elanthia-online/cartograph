    "The top of the tower is open to the elements and a cold steady wind tugs at you.  A few glow globes spaced about the low tower wall barely provide enough illumination to see by, but you can clearly see the glowing designs of the star charts and constellations inlaid in the granite walls.  A tremendous, gleaming telescope pointing towards the starfilled night sky dominates the center of the tower.  Far below you can see the street lanterns of Wehnimer's Landing spread out like a crystal latticework.",
    "The top of the tower is open to the elements and a steady wind tugs at you.  A tremendous, gleaming silver telescope pointing towards the sky dominates the center of the tower.  Engraved into the thick marble wall surrounding the top of the tower are star charts and constellations inlaid with mithglin, which gleams brightly when the sun strikes it.  You can see all of Wehnimer's Landing spread out below you from here."
