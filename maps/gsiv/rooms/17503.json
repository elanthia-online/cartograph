  "description": [
    "Moss green carpeting with badly worn patches spreads from wall to wall in this bedchamber.  Wicker end tables flank a small wicker-framed bed that has multihued spheres embroidered on the coverlet.  In one corner of the room, propped against the paneled wall, is a life-sized stuffed polar bear.  One the opposite wall, a pilum is hung on metal brackets."
