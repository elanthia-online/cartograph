    "A rambling half-timbered building stands along the north side of the road, its size and second story proclaiming it as an inn or public house.  Fresh whitewash on the plaster and stain on the timbers gives it a new look, but the moss on the weather-bleached wooden shingles suggest that the building is older than the bridge to the west."
