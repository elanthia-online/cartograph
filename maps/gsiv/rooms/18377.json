    "A tall riverstone wall, overrun with dark green ivy vines, runs the length of the meditation garden, enclosing it against the inside of the monastery.  A single narrow arch disrupts the wall of ivy and stone and from it runs a simple pebbled path which encircles four small reflecting pools bordered by closely sheared emerald green grass in the shape of squares.  Worn stone slabs are nestled into the grass facing the pools."
