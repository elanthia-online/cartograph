    "Large stones peeking out of the river make a bridge here.  Silver-sided fish swim about in the water, their bodies almost indistinguishable from the moonlit ripples their movements create on the surface of the river, and crayfish scoot backwards under the rocks.  The air is cool, and should it strike your fancy, this place would make a lovely fishing and picnic spot.",
