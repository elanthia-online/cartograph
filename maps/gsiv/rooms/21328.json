    "The walls are slightly burned in spots where someone's apparently amateurish attempts at magic have gone awry.  Dead center in the room is a heavy marble slab scratched and blackened from the powerful spells which have been cast in the room.  The ceiling is covered with polished copper, the mirrored surface reflecting your movements."
