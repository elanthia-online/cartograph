    "Neatly cobblestoned lanes extend off in three directions, lined by rows of thick shade trees that filter dappled light onto the varicolored stone.  Cottages of brick and wood line the streets, bounded by colorful flowerbeds and neatly trimmed bushes.  A large calico cat rests in a patch of sun at the end of a shaded path between the trees.",

A large calico cat peers out from the shadows, its eyes glinting yellow in the starlight before it scurries down a shaded path between the trees."
