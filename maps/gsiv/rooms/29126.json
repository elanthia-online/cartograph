  "description": [
    "Marram grass clings to the edges of the curving road, small tufts pushing up between the irregular-shaped cobblestones.  Dormant lanterns, their stained glass windows glistening in the sunlight, are evenly spaced on both sides of the road, with a pair flanking the entry of a whitewashed inn.  A colorful sign spreads across the second floor of the structure between shuttered windows."
