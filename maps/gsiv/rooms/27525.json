    "Smooth wooden walls encapsulate the room, their surfaces carved with vines.  Bundles of herbs hang from the ceiling, filling the room with a floral scent.  Along one wall is a set of shelves holding lockpicks.  A series of pendants hang from a small wire rack, and several small cases sit on a carved rosewood bench."
