  "description": [
    "A quartet of arched vaalin windows affords a generous view of the moonlit garden.  Swathes of plum charmeuse frame each window in billowing pools of silk, the curtains caught and held in place by creamy enamel stargazer lilies.  Glass teardrop vases frame the shadowed room, providing a sense of symmetrical order amidst the simplistic furnishings.  An arrangement of high-backed mahogany chairs circle a low mistwood table, while an elaborate mistwood teacart rests in waiting against a patterned wall."
