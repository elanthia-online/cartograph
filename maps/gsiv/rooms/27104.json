    "Jutting forth from the muddy banks of the river, tall stands of heliconias sway in the current.  Clumps of grass congest the flow of water, their tapering surfaces beaded with iridescent droplets as insects drink from the tiny pools of liquid.  A fairly large collection of water grasses has created a floating meadow on the eastern side of the river, the feathery tops of the plants enshrouding a host of living creatures within."
