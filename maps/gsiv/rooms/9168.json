    "A large barrel sitting directly in the middle of the floor makes it necessary to veer to either side in order to pass.  Oddly, a rhythmic ticking that sounds much like a muffled metronome comes from within the sealed container.  At the base of this barrel, a small crack has allowed a tiny pile of greyish powder to spill out.  The faint scent of sulphur touches the air."
