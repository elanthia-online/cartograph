    "Shelves line the walls of this small area of the wagon, laden with jars of brightly gleaming gemstones, vases of colorful feathers, and spools of satin ribbons in a variety of hues.  Overhead hangs several glass-shaded lanterns, filling the room with a warm, amber light, while piles of silken pillows ring the edge of the space, all centered around a single, tufted violet cushion.  Near the cushion sits a tiered sewing box and several trays of odd and intriguing adornments."
