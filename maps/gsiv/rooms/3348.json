  "description": [
    "A winding passageway feeds into this surprisingly large marble alcove.  At the end of the chamber, where an enclosing wall should be, is an open view into the town center of the town center of Icemule Trace.  The opening into the city defies all logic as the view would seem to indicate that this chamber is directly in the middle of the town, which would be impossible.  The impressiveness of this chamber relays that its current function betrays its true origin."
