    "A plump, gnomish woman adjusts the lenses on a gold and silver loupe as she scrutinizes a tiny, shiny ring in her hand.  She grunts and pulls a small metal tool from her belt, makes a few adjustments, and with a nod places it on a short silver jewelry tree before reaching for the next piece.  Elsewhere in the room, a makeshift birchwood mantel rests over a small stone fire pit, while other shelves display an assortment of bouquets and simple weaving materials for purchase."
