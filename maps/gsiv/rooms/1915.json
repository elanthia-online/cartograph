  "description": [
    "Wagons lumber down the avenue, kicking up a choking dust in their wake.  The warmth that surrounds the neighborhood mud baths doesn't reach this far into the mountainside, so the inhabitants rely on fireplaces and pipes to carry heat inside their homes.  Additional ductwork carries the unwanted smoke out to the surface."
