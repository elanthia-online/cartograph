    "Bordered on two sides by the riverstone interior wall of the monastery, the meditation garden is divided into four small reflecting pools bordered by closely sheared emerald green grass in the shape of squares.  Simple pebbled paths cast a yellow contrast against the grass and the blue of the sky reflected on the still waters of the pools.  Worn stone slabs are nestled into the grass facing the pools."
