    "The walls of this small cabin have been painted a matte shade of black, and thin stripes of dark violet stretch from ceiling to floor.  Silver-armed sconces supporting ebon satin shades spill pools of light on the floor, and a matching three-armed candlestick sits at the center of a round ebonwood table.  Nearby, a lavender velvet-lined tray sits atop a simple display, and a silver-inked black parchment sign is propped alongside."
