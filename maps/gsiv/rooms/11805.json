    "A flat sea of black mud with a rusty red tinge spreads out on all sides, and its surface shines from the thin layer of water that covers it.  The water reflects the moonlight brilliantly, almost blindingly.  The beauty is marred by the uncomfortable humidity that rises from the mud sea, causing clothing and armor to take on a moist feel and chafe annoyingly.  The area also carries the nauseating odor of putrefying plant life.",
