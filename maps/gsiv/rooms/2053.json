  "description": [
    "A few ramshackle structures have been thrown up here, most little more than leather tents pitched by fishermen to protect their skiffs and nets during the winter.  The Hog's Pen Tavern with its walls of stacked tanik logs is the sturdiest structure in sight.  At the rear of the tavern, there is a pile of refuse and a trough that overflows with left-over meals and rain water.  The sounds of a bustling town echo down the best-kept of the various roads and paths that meet here."
