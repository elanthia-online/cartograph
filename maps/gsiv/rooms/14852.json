    "The shadowy lane lined with its handsome rows of poplars makes a gentle curve to east and southwest.  The dark boles of the trees punctuate the dense shadows beneath the boughs, darker smudges against the dusky tones.  To the east, the end of the poplars is visible, giving way to a moonlit expanse of rolling meadows.",
    "The flower-garlanded lane lined with its handsome rows of poplars makes a gentle curve to east and southwest.  The brown boles of the trees punctuate the shadows beneath the boughs, their exposed, gnarly roots spotted with tiny white blossoms nestled in feathery greenery.  To the east, the end of the poplars is visible, giving way to an expanse of rolling meadows."
