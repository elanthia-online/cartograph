  "description": [
    "Curtains of heavy leather strips section off the entrance to this large open space, making sure none of its avian residents would find easy passage out.  The air here is hot and humid, and the sound of running water can be heard over the din of numerous, varying bird calls.  A stone-lined path winds its way through heavy, tropical plant growth, edging around a stand of massive palms."
