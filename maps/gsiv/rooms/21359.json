    "Built along branches of living wood, this suite provides a majestic view of the rose garden.  The plush puma hide rug softening your footsteps seems to accent the natural luster of the living wooden walls.  The room is lit by soft flickers of sunshine streaming through a large aquarium that sits next to a window on the south wall.  A grand canopied bed rests in an alcove on the north wall, which contains built-in shelves lined with various small sculptures and mementos of the McThain family."
