    "The rising steps level into a tiled floor sheltered beneath a velarium of heavy onyx-hued fabric on a latticed metal frame.  Despite the ill condition of the colosseum at large, this open air atrium is relatively unscathed, offering a secluded repose high above the arena.  Braziers of wrought iron stand beside each support pillar, and the embers within burn with an unnatural red-violet glow.  A small niche is recessed into the rear wall, while a few stone benches sit in the center of the floor."
