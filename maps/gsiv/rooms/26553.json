    "The interior wall here has crumbled, the granite compacted and buckled beneath an immense stone shed by the outer wall.  A quick glimpse of the empty space between the walls offers a view of several small bundles tucked inside, each bound in leather cording and dusty.",
    "Several whole and partial floor tiles are strewn at the base of the wall along with a pair of nippers, and a grout-covered sponge has been left soaking in a shallow basin of grey water.  Across the way, a section between pillars has been chalked out on the floor, a crude illustration indicating a future feature of the temple.",
    "A few heavy crates packed with straw sit side by side against the wall, while a length of decorative wrought iron railing is propped against the pillar, awaiting installation.  A trio of iron brackets mounted high on the wall remain empty and awaiting items to display.",
    "A bone-numbing chill haunts the outer edge of the temple sanctuary, and the only sound is the guttering of the candles set on a many-armed candelabra.  Two niches carved deep into the granite walls house a variety of ghezyte statuary, some bearing the damage of age while others seem newly sculpted.  From time to time, the candlelight catches on the metallic inclusion of the granite, giving the illusion of movement when glimpsed from the corner of the eye."
