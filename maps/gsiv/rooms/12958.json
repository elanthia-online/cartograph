    "A flattened granite boulder sits tumbled to the side of the path near the top of the hill, and a great hollow has been carved out of its exposed underside.  Further up the hill to the north, a black obelisk thrusts up against the night sky beside the bulk of a great circular tower.  The worn track spirals steeply downhill to the southwest and disappears around a tangle of hawthorn trees.",
