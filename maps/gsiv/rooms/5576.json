  "description": [
    "The sounds of the beast pens and other caravan noises to the north echo off the immense blue granite walls that surround Vornavis.  From within the walls come the familiar noises of city life that, in turn, combine with the animal noises to make an odd mix of sounds.  A guard stands at the gate into the city, watching carefully all who enter."
