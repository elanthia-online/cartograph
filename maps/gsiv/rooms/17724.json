    "A dry area nestles among the cypresses here with black water all around waiting to engulf it should it sink any lower.  Farther away humid fog blankets the area, making it impossible to see any significant distance into the cypress forest.  A narrow isthmus of reed-choked soil leads off to the southwest, and small, stepping stone hillocks dot the water to the north.  A long bridge extends out into the mist to the south."
