  "description": [
    "Several sturdy maoral poles support the silk structure, creating peaks and valleys in the ceiling.  Several chairs are scattered about a great sapphire wool carpet that covers the grass inside the large tent.  Hanging from the peaks of the ceiling are lanterns suspended on marbled faenor chains.  A vine and flower-patterned tapestry is draped across an opening in the silk walls."
