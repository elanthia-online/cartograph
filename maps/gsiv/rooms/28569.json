    "[A Piercing Scream, Parlor]"

  "description": [
    "A floor-to-ceiling crushed velvet curtain partitions off this cozy parlor from the rest of the tent, muffling the sounds of shoppers browsing just on the other side.  Pillows are haphazardly scattered across the floor like stepping stones in a pond, their meandering path leading to a small steel wash basin for washing up.  A silvery mistwood armchair, its finish marred by a myriad of crescent-shaped indentations, stands next to a full-length mirror framed in tangled golden trumpetvines."
