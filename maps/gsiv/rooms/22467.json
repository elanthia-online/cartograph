    "Frosted willow green walls artistically painted with chains of entwined berries and twigs help create a cosy winter-themed atmosphere inside the small wagon.  Several vases filled with haphazardly arranged wildflowers are dotted about the room, their heady scent filling the air.  A large wooden sign is propped up against one of the walls."
