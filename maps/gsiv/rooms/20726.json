    "Dominating the room is a large modwir table, deep burgundy cushioned chairs lining either side.  A long glass-topped sideboard laden with food and drink stands between two silk covered windows, a golden runner draped over its length.  Hanging on the opposite wall is a huge tapestry, the rich colors blending with those woven into the plush carpet that covers the floor.  Several marble urns filled with a variety of silk tropical flowers are placed about, so as not to detract from the scent of delicacies."
