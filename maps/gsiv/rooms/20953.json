    "Rocky terrain replaces the verdant jungle upon this lonely seaside cliff.  Meandering saltwater breezes escalate to dangerous winds, whipping around the point with unbridled ferocity.  Steep and treacherous to the casual climber, the ridge offers no easily accessible route to the higher cliffs above or to the sea beyond.  To the southwest a fallen tree trunk extends a welcome, if haphazard, connection to a plateau planted squarely within the landscape of the stepped valley."
