    "Droplets flow from a knotted wood ceiling to thick banyan roots that form the natural walls of this tiny cavern.  Numerous formations of multihued crystals sprout from the roots and wind along the floor in a pattern of musical notes that bend and twist around each other.  The air is saturated with moisture, and the scent of fresh, clean water is prominent."
