  "description": [
    "The rectangular-shaped space has chairs of all imaginable sizes and shapes arranged in tiny rows off a central aisle.  Looking more like an eclectic meeting room than a shop, the only clue is a piece of parchment scrawled with numbers that represent a suggested price placed on the seat of each chair.  A rattan counter sits at the far back of the room, forcing potential customers to walk past the items on display."
