  "description": [
    "Deep purple columns rise up at regular intervals around this room which has been painted entirely in a florid hot pink.  The massive visage featured in the expansive plush rug that covers most of the floor can be seen in one of the many mismatched ornate mirrors hanging upon the garish walls.  Gold chains have been affixed to the ceiling, upon which hang a series of jewel-encrusted cages."
