  "description": [
    "Sheer emerald green curtains drape along the sides of the four poster bed covered with a matching spread and plump pillows.  Vultite shaded oil-lit lamps shed their light upon a dark monir table and chairs by a window.  A marble fireplace carved with fanciful sprites fills one wall and adds warmth to the room."
