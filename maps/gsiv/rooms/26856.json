    "Weathered planks of dark mahogany line the walls of this tiny, windowless space.  An immense iron rack displays weapons against the far wall, though discerning one from another is difficult in the dimly lit space.  A low oak table holding additional weapons threatens to deliver a blow to the shins of distracted shoppers."
