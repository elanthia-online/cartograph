    "Crushed chunks of granite are loosely piled in a tall heap at the heart of the alcove, interspersed with foot-long shards of a dark, unrecognizable metal.  Dust in thick layers coats the floor underfoot, though cracks in the granite are easily felt.",
    "Wedge-shaped blocks of granite sit at the center of this wide alcove, loosely arranged to form an elevated circle.  Two piles of slightly smaller blocks of the same shape are lined up next to the center aisle, and a bucket of freshly mixed mortar rests nearby.",
    "Unpolished granite forms the lower tiers of a raised dais, while the uppermost tier is yet to be completed.  At regular intervals along the front curve of the middle tier are bored out holes lined with hammered pewter, and a box of silvery glaes shades sits off to the side.",
    "Centered on the highest tier of the circular dais is an imposing ghezyte altar composed of stark lines and elaborate carvings.  Indigo candles ensconced by silvery glaes create a half-moon at the fore of the platform, leaving the rear of the dais shrouded in darkness.  The oscillation of each miniscule candle flame is complicit in creating an illusion on the surface of the ghezyte of twisted and distorted forms, trapped and writhing as if trying to escape."
