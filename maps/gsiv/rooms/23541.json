    "Moonlight shines over a stone wall, casting the tall, overgrown hedge lining a stately manor's courtyard into deep shadow.  A leaf-strewn brick path stretches between a rusty iron gate and the steps leading to the manor's doors.  Barely distinguishable in the blackness under the boughs of an enormous weeping willow sits a wrought iron bench."
