    "Parting from the mountain's face and rising high into the air, a grey and ivory flagstone tower casts its long shadow across the pathway and plunges the area into a murky darkness suffused with silvery moonlight.  Water streams down the face of the cliff, creating deep rivulets in the cobblestones and moves swiftly enough to carry bits of shale and sand with it.  Clumps of seaweed-infested ground display signs of erosion near the wrought iron railing that prevents passersby from tumbling over the edge.",
