    "Rows of cages line the walkways, bars rusting away in the damp air.  Within each is a deformed and horrible creature, stalking behind the metal grills.  The cage in the center contains a three-headed lion, frothing and drooling in snarling rage.  A woman stands within it, desperately attempting to hold the maws of the lion's heads shut, but her chances look slim at best."
