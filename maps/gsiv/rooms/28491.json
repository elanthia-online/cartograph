    "Gleaming silver tridents are set upon the wall, adding a touch of brightness to the swirling deep blue hue of the surrounding walls.  Many small pools are aligned in neat rows about the floor, their surfaces rippling with reflected light.  Faint wavy patterns flow along the dark tiles between the different pools, resembling the gently undulating waves of an ocean current."
