    "An immense arch of ice battles to remain standing against the ravages of the wind.  Through the makeshift gateway, the open expanses of the frozen tundra provide little protection from the chilling temperatures.  The treacherous slopes of Mount Aenatumgana tower above the flats, the peak of the gigantic mountain invisible through the blowing sleet and snow.  Two sets of frozen steps, carved out of the mountainside, lead up to the precarious east and west approaches to the summit."
