    "A plain rosewood table draped with a narrow white linen cloth rests in the center of the room, its only decoration a polished silver bowl lit by a falling shaft of sunlight.  Placed reverently before the table is a straight-backed dark teak bench.  The floor is bare and scrubbed clean to the very corners.",
