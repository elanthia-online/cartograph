  "description": [
    "The cobblestone walk parallels the bank of Hummingbird Pond, edged with a lush border of red and white zinnias.  Cottages line up side by side, with flowers blooming on their sod roofs like blossoms woven into a halfling's hair.  Access to the buildings is gained through doors that are perfectly round, giving the homes a slight ambiance of surprise."
