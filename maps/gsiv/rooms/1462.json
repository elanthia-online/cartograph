    "The buildings along this stretch of Wentletrap Lane are ornamented with a variety of sawtoothing, panelling and moldings, creating variety in a fairly conservative style.  A large, verdigrised brass quill hangs above the doorway of a small shop that occupies the northeast corner of the Scriveners' Hall."
