  "description": [
    "The branches of nearby trees on the shoreline extend over the lagoon, shading the water and breaking apart shafts of sunlight with their leaf-laden forms.  Though the humidity is still prominent, the coolness of the lagoon provides a small respite from the intense heat as the water laps gently back and forth.  Sunlight glistens from the crystalline surface of the liquid, lending it a sparkling appearance that extends in a vivid field of silky blue water towards the rushing waterfall in the north."
