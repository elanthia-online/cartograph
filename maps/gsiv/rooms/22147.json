    "Several large, crystal globe-capped sconces are evenly spaced throughout the floral-papered wall, providing soft luminosity for the quaint room.  Tiers of teak shelves rise in one corner, their lengths laden with heavy terracotta urns that are planted to overflow with all manner of flowers and herbs.  Golden sunlight spills through the red velvet-framed windows, providing nutrients for the vegetation and also dispelling all shadows from around a double-wide mahogany bed and a carved golden linden chair."
