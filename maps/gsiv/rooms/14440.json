    "This habitat is structured in two layers.  Giants of the forest, their straight grey-brown barked trunks arrowing towards the sky, grow on the lower layer.  Emerald green treeferns, their leaves as tall as a giantman, obscure the view of the trees.  Thick, woody lianas vines grow throughout the greenery, giving the agile servaline genet an avenue to explore the treetops.",

The upper layer of ferny growth is cast into deep shadow by the overhanging trees.  Thick, woody lianas vines grow throughout the greenery, giving the agile servaline genet the opportunity to find a resting place in the treetops."
