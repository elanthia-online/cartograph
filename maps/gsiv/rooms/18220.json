    "Set back from the well-lit streets of the marketplace, the courtyard is very dark.  The only source of light is coming from an intricate metalwork door set in the whitewashed wall of a small cottage.  The light coming through the door illuminates the start of a cobblestone path that leads towards the back of the cottage.",
    "Set back from the bustling market, this small courtyard is much more quiet.  An intricate metalwork door is set in the whitewashed wall of a small cottage while a cobblestone path leads around to the back where you see a small plume of smoke rising in the air."
