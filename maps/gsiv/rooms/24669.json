    "Shadowed by modwir trees, a series of granite stepping stones leads into the garden, following the gently curving pathway of a gurgling stream.  Sparkling with dappled moonlight, the water trickles past clumps of verdant moss and wild orchids to disappear under an ivy-covered stone wall.  Terraced beds lush with foliage in varying shades of green edge the walls.  A seating area with polished ironwood benches is positioned near a mistwood-framed tea room with a multi-paneled double door."
