    "A wide variety of skins stretched on simple wooden frames stand propped against the support poles in this section of the tent, continuing the macabre theme.  The temperature is lessened considerably by distance from the fire pit alone, but there is also a lingering weight to the air - something that seems almost to provide resistance to movement.  Despite the lack of heat, the effect creates a stifling atmosphere in this section of the tent."
