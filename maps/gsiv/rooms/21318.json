    "This room is bright and airy.  Varicolored crystals hang in front of the large windows and all the colors of the rainbow dance and flit about on every breeze.  A huge white bearskin rug from the far north stretches out before the polished stone fireplace and a straight-backed chair stands alongside it.  Beneath the windows, a long low couch reclines.",
