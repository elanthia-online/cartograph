    "The ground is very moist, and water seeps up around boots and feet.",
    "The ground is very moist, and water seeps up around boots and feet.  The tracks of hoofed animals are plainly evident in the wet clay soil.  Lower than most of the areas around it, this portion of the barley fields collects much of the runoff from the rains.  The barley plants here seem to be surviving well despite the increased amount of soil moisture. To the east, though, the plants appear to be suffering from an overabundance of water."
