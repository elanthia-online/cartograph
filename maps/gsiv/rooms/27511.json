    "The area is decorated with deep reds, vivid oranges, and bright yellows.  Standing on either side of the exit are some varied wooden mannequins of varying shape and sizes, while a gold coin-carved table sits in the far corner.  Leading further into the wagon's compartments is a green paint-chipped archway."
