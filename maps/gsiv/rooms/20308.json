    "[Ornate Wagon]"

  "description": [
    "Floridly colored and brass-trimmed, the wagon stands in bright contrast to the dull umber of the dismal miasma.  Its garish ornamentation belies the mundane nature of the wagon.  Shelves of preserves and pickled foods line its walls.  Netted shanks of cured pork share the ceiling with dangling loops of the dark, salted flesh of other, unknown sources.  A ragged orb pressed against the face of a jar of pickled giblets looks alarmingly like an eye."
