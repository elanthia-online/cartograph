    "A foot or so above the stream's flow, small clumps of moss have taken hold on the granite sides of the tunnel.  Apparently the humidity provides enough water, and the airflow provides enough fresh air, for the moss to at least stay alive.  The moss that lives here, though, does not appear to be thriving, but rather, clinging to life.  It is also interesting to note that no moss grows anywhere near the flowing water."
