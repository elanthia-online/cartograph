    "A raised circular platform of white limestone dominates this little nook, surrounded closely by sheltering gingko trees.  Fifty candles of different shapes and colors cluster in concentric circles on the platform.  Every so often one dies out and then another magically springs to life.  On the perimeter, hundreds of long white candles burn brightly, their flames reflecting off the gingkoes to bathe the area in a light green glow."
