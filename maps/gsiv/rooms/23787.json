    "Hot, bright fires burn in iron iron baskets that have been mounted in regular intervals high on the walls of this large cavern.  Centered in the subterrane is a circular arena with a sand-covered floor.  The air carries the lingering scent of the oil used to keep the dust at a minimum.  Sloping rows of stone benches surround the floor in twelve sections, each allowing for a different spectator view.",
