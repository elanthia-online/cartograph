    "The warm steam that rises from the warm swirling water makes it difficult to see details.  The shapes of the lush plants surrounding the pool fade from view from time to time as yet another cloud of mist forms and floats past.  The water of the pool is warm and comforting as it washes away the aches and pains of the last journey."
