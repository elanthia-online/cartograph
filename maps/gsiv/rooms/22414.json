    "Windowless, and lit only by a few guttering torches, the area is dim.  The ceiling, high overhead, is a mass of shadowed fan vaulting, while the open space of the room itself is a mass of assorted dummies, pieces of training equipment and roped-off bout rings.  The walls are plastered with targets, the area about each dotted with countless nicks and scars."
