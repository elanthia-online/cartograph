    "A stately building constructed from weathered blue-veined grey marble stands behind a neatly trimmed hawthorn hedge that grows along the edge of the wey.  Sunlight filters through tall trees to cast dappled light along the building's high walls.  A massive granite block archway with lanterns hanging on either side interrupts the hedge to provide an entrance.",
