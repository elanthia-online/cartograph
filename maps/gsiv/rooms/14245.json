  "description": [
    "The watchful eyes of a heroic crowned figure stare down from above, casting their gaze upon a tiered fountain fashioned in the shape of a rearing dragon.  Beyond the statue, a golden stairway marches up a steep incline to the dais.  Incised crowns adorn the ashen marble tiles of the floor."
