    "The bright light of torches illuminates the trunk of the oak and a cleared area around it.  The ground about the base of the tree has been hard packed by the passage of others, forming a path that leads off around the trunk.  The torches filling this part of the forest with light are of a high quality and rest in ornate holders.  A small patch of grass carpets the area before the oak."
