  "description": [
    "Polished villswood flooring stretches the length of this enormous room.  Soft golden teak paneling above pristine white wainscoting adds a warmth to the room.  Numerous paintings, depicting momentous events throughout history line the walls, lending their color to the grandeur of the hall.  A stately lor grandfather clock with beveled glass panels dominates the north wall next to a grand staircase that leads upwards towards a wide landing and the upper floors."
