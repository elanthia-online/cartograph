    "A painted native mask hangs on one of the woven grass divider walls, and a woven seagrass ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a woven seagrass floor.  There is an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on one side of the shop and a floral-etched ceramic case on the other."
