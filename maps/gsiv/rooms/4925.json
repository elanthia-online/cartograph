    "Soaring above all but the tallest trees and as narrow as a sapling, a white stone arch stands in singular splendor at the center of a clearing.  Perhaps some residual magic still holds it up or perhaps it was simply too well-built to fall, but its presence only serves to emphasize the absence of the civilization that once surrounded it.  Stone slabs mark where buildings once stood, home now only to lichen and ferns.",

The arch appears as a ghostly arm in the nighttime gloom.

Stone slabs mark where buildings once stood, home now only to lichen and ferns."
