  "description": [
    "Serpentine trails weave through the deep grass and then disapear into the heavy growth, but the gentle swaying motion of the stalks show that whatever originated the marks is likely still about.  One of the wooden planks of the path has what looks to be teeth marks deeply inbedded into it from the powerful jaws of some large beast."
