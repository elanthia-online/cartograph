    "The low vaulted stone ceiling has been ornamented by whimsical carvings of small woodland creatures chasing among twining ivies.  The pattern is continued in a carved stone counter, upon which rest several official-looking tomes and documents.  Behind the counter, several serious-looking clerks bend studiously over scrolls, occasionally making an annotation as they read."
