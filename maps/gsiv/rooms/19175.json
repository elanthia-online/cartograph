    "Spotlessly clean and minimalist in decor, this room is brightened by the sleek canary silk that covers all four walls.  A plain haon wardrobe stands against the far wall, and a polished oak table rests upon a white rabbit fur rug in the middle of the room.  The northern wall is fitted with a smooth white shelf piled high with folded garments."
