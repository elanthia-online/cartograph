    "This portion of the pavilion is crammed full of wooden dress forms, oddly bare except their arms.  An ornate electrum crown chandelier is suspended from the apex of the ebonwood poles that support the heavy velvet walls and ceiling, bathing the area in a soft, candlelit glow.  One dress form is tilted slightly, propped off-balance by an abandoned piece of chalk beneath its base."
