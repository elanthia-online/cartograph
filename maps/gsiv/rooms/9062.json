    "Several oak desks stand in neat rows behind a low railing that bisects the small room.  A thin gate allows the clerks to move between the two halves of the room and is latched from the other side with a thin iron bar.  Bulletin boards line the walls and are covered with rough sketches of property from the surrounding area.  Polished glass panes allow sunlight to stream into the waiting area, which is littered with low oak benches.",

Brass wall sconces illuminate the bulletin boards lining the walls, each covered with rough sketches of property from the surrounding area.
