    "Beneath a vaulted ceiling, a cast metal cherry blossom branch hangs on one of the smooth ivory walls framed in wide white trim.  A trio of linen-clad wireframe dress mannequins and a thin fel rod hung from two ornate lacquered ebonwood corbels sit in opposite corners while a white vanilla orchid-filled vase rests on a wide-planked distressed fel floor."
