    "Thick green vegetation provides very little visibility over any distance, making it hard to navigate.  Beech and rosewood trees rise high up into the sky.  A thick mist swirls about the arching branches, adding to the hazy darkness of the forest.  The sound of bubbling water comes from the east."
