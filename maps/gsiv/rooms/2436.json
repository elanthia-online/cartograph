    "Short and very rotund, a grumpy dwarf sits off in a corner, his clothing filthy with dirt and wood shavings.  A plate of sliced rolton meat has been piled atop a wedge of bread that sits in a pool of natural gravy.  A crude sign tacked up on the wall loudly declares, \"You buy it, we move it\" in heavy black lettering."
