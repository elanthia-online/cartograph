    "Detailed maps are painted onto the walls of this room, the stone varying in hue to delineate vegetation, terrain, and water.  Occupying much of the space is a circular hunter green couch, perfect for a comfortable discussion in the artistic surroundings.  The hardwood floor is inlaid with an enormous compass rose, decorated around the edges with various flora and fauna.  A thanot-framed sign is affixed to the wall above a petrified modwir serving tray."
