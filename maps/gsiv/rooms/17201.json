  "description": [
    "The walls of this small room are draped with black velvet and silver spidersilk.  Hundreds of votive candles are scattered about the room on the polished ebonwood floor, forming a vague circle around a central marble platform.  On the platform rests a crystal coffin in which lies a beautiful young woman.",
    "Polished onyx arcs overhead to form a high-domed ceiling, its surface studded with diamonds in the patterns of the constellations of the night sky.  In the center of the chamber stands a marble pedestal, where a tall black candle provides the sole source of light.  Along the far side of the room, a silver-edged sword of carved jet hangs halfway down the wall."
