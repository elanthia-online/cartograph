    "The courtyard lawns are well kept and beautifully landscaped.  Many varieties of night-blooming flowers are planted in beds bordering the temple walls, and tall cast iron lamposts are placed evenly along the onyx flagstone path to provide light at night.  A high stone wall separates temple grounds from the rest of the town.",
