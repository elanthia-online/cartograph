    "In the center of the room stands a large triangular table cut from a single slab of granite.  A large faceted crystal globe hangs over the table, and three smaller ones adorn each corner.  A lone chair sits on each face of the triangle that forms the table.  Five feet behind each of those chairs rest two more with a small table between them."
