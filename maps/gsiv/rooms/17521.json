  "description": [
    "The musty smells of damp earth and moldering stone clash with the acrid smoke from guttering censers scattered throughout this narrow space tucked between the foundations of massive columns.  Someone has hung some old tapestries in the gaps between the footings, but their decaying and moth-eaten fabrics do little but reinforce the shabbiness of the area  The only furnishing is a slab of ochre sandstone, from which hangs several wooden amulets."
