    "Descending deep into the mountain, a narrow walkway winds steeply through a curtain of liquid-sheened rock.  The colors vary as the rock reaches deeper into the abyss, starting with a coppery orange colored rock near the upper part of the path that deepens with streaks of scarlet, reminiscent of despanal's hue, as it works its way down.  Mellow illumination seeps in from the entranceway, making this part of the cavern barely visible."
