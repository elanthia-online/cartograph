    "A wide stairway of pale gold marble fills the hall, curving sharply along the wall as it ascends.  Scrolled golden oak banisters on brass posts flank the stairway, and a long scarlet rug spills down its center to pool just before the arched doorway leading into the antechamber.  Along the curved walls, long floral tapestries alternate with the bright glow of gaily flickering lanterns."
