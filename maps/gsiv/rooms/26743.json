    "Rocky walls consisting of dark shale in some areas and limestone in others spread all around in this cozy space.  A diminutive worktable, its surface covered in dust and ashes, holds a handful of blades sans hilts, some stained with sanguine and all wrought with cracks through their metal makeup.  Clearly ready for display and sale, a separate collection of blades, each finely crafted into a dagger and fully intact, dangles from a braided black rope that splays across the length of the area."
