    "The smell of the forest and a light breeze flow through the room.  Short walls separate the space from the rest of the guild, surrounding the room as waist-high railings.  The wooden roof is supported by a few sturdy posts, and a bar stands to one side of the doors, inviting stools arranged in front of it.  Tables are arranged close to the rails, leaving the center open for dancing and providing a view of the forest below."
