    "Four small lanterns overhead cast a ruddy glow over this compact room, augmenting the slanting sunbeam projected from a large crystal overhead.  The room is dominated by a table covered with maps, many pierced with red-tipped pins.  Superintendent Draelox and several other officers stand near a small woodstove in a corner, their stern expressions matching the tone of their soft mutterings."
