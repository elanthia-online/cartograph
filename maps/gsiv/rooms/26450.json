    "Enormous wrought iron stakes are pounded into the smooth shale wall along the eastern edge of the ravine anchoring a rickety staircase of teak and steel that ascends into mist.  In contrast, the western wall is smooth and slick with water from an unseen force, it's unyielding face blotting out the moonlight.  Along this section of the ravine, the sound of rushing, swirling water collides with the howl of an unseen and unfelt wind.",
