  "description": [
    "Musty air fills the basement, a fitting companion to the stagnant puddles covering the cool earthen floor.  A menagerie of insects scurry about the room while large spiders slowly travel across the floor towards new homes.  Crumbling stone steps head up to a small landing before turning towards a doorway above."
