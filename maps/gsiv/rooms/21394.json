    "Empty plates and cups, most of them clean, are stacked on shelves beneath the counter.  Neatly labeled boxes and sacks of supplies are arranged on a wooden rack at the far end of the counter.  A bowl of milk, a blanket-filled wicker basket and a tangled ball of yarn occupy the farthest corner."
