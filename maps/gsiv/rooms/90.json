    "A gentle, rushing roar announces the presence of a waterfall leaping over a ledge of rock on the hillside above your head.  The pool which forms at the bottom is small, but still deep enough to preserve a blue-green radiance.  From his perch atop a hummock of moss, a glistening toad serenades the forest."
