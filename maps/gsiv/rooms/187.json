    "The northern corner of the court is relatively quiet, the low hum of conversation punctuated only by the occasional bursts of laughter emanating from the nearby dais.  A row of monir trees delineates the curvature of the cobblestoned lane, their leafy boughs creating a shady resting spot.",
    "The northern corner of the court is relatively quiet, the low hum of conversation punctuated only by the occasional bursts of laughter emanating from the nearby dais.  A row of monir trees delineates the curvature of the cobblestoned lane, their leafy boughs creating a peaceful resting spot.",
    "The bottom of the floating dais overhead falls over this patch of the courtyard, shrouding the cobblestones below in a darkness only broken by the purposeful placement of a few silver lanterns.  Their unflickering blue light gives the space a ghostly glow.",
    "The bottom of the floating dais overhead falls over this patch of the courtyard, shrouding the cobblestones below in a dim, perpetual gloaming.  Nonetheless, the space is filled with impermanent shelving and carrels, set out with no regard for order, placement, or easy passage through the morass."
