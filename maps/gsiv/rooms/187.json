    "The northern corner of the court is relatively quiet, the low hum of conversation punctuated only by the occasional bursts of laughter emanating from the nearby dais.  A row of monir trees delineates the curvature of the cobblestoned lane, their leafy boughs creating a shady resting spot.",

    "The bottom of the floating dais overhead falls over this patch of the courtyard, shrouding the cobblestones below in a dim, perpetual gloaming.
