    "The eastern section of the upper wall serves as a loading bay.  A large section of the outer wall has been cut and attached to rawhide hinges, allowing it to fold down during loading operations.  A long pole sticks out over the wall, with rope and pulleys attached to raise cargo to the height.  Large stones line the outer wall in several rows."
