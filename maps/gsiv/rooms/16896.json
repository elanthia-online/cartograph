    "Splotches of bright color stain the surrounding stone from floor to ceiling with only a few uncovered areas offering a glimpse of the natural grey hue.  A variety of notices have been placed around the alcove, most notably a stone plaque and a big hand-painted sign.  Hanging off the back of a chair is a dye-covered apron with dirty gloves shoved in its pockets."
