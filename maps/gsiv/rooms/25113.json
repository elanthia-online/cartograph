    "Some tables, carved from mahogany, complement low wooden benches sitting next to them.  Atop each table is a collection of neatly stacked playing cards accompanied by a pile of colorful chips.  The crimson carpet ends here, while polished planks of knotted and burled hardwood continue onward towards the servants chambers."
