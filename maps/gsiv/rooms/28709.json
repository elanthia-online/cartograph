    "In a stark contrast with the dirt and filth above, this plush lounge is filled with luxurious amenities.  Diagonal black and alizarin stripes line the walls, while an iridescent triton hide rug covers the floor in front of a a glossy obsidian fireplace.  Adorned with golden golvern studs, a leather-edged hammered glaes bar stretches from one side of the room to the other, displaying a massive aged oak cask, while a supple black leather couch rests in the corner, ready to provide rest to the weary traveler."
