    "Slender wisps of light stream through the air between a tall, somewhat insubstantial wooden palisade and the heavily angled cavern wall.  Several of the glowing motes hover near the tips of various stalactites, as if drawn to them.  Central to the view is a large, rectangular platform topped with a variety of trees."
