    "Surrendering to the descent of the terrain, rock-strewn soil tumbles and scatters along the natural rock steps leading to the powdery sand of the beach.  Dense shadows cling to the outskirts of the dark jungle looming to the north, and the ever-present resonations of nocturnal creatures occupying the labyrinth battle against the lapping sounds of the ocean along the shore.  Moonlight glitters off the endless span of blue water greeting the coastline, rippling with the rhythmic approach and retreat of the tide.",

Clusters of vegetation embrace the outskirts of the exotic jungle looming to the north, and the ever-present resonations of the inhabitants of the dense labyrinth battle against the lapping sounds of the ocean along the shore.  An endless span of blue water greets the coastline, rippling with the rhythmic approach and retreat of the tide."
