    "Steamy air swirls throughout the room, its wooden walls and a stained glass door glisten with condensation.  Several large bronze braziers scattered about glow with banked embers, water-filled ceramic urns evaporating humidly over them.  Carved stone benches lie to either side of a laquered oak door, and across the room are the entrances to several private saunas."
