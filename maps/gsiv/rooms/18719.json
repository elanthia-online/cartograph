    "This open, airy room has a carved ironwood bed placed in the southeast corner of the smooth, polished floor.  A sturdy chest rests at its foot, and a wide shelf hangs on the south wall above the headboard.  Three identical beds are placed in a row on the other side of a doorway framed by two windows, each with a chest and shelf.  Wrought iron sconces supporting unlit oil lamps are set into the walls, and the north side of the room has a clear path to the dart board hanging on the east wall."
