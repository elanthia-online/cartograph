    "A huge silver chandelier centrally located over the massive marble desk brightly illuminates this rectangular office.  The light shimmers off the silver carpet and reflects off the white marble walls.  A bookcase stuffed with tomes of all sizes and colors extends from floor to ceiling along the back wall, and several comfortable chairs nestle together in one corner, perhaps to facilitate quiet meetings with Guild members."
