    "Narrow in width, expansive in length, the tented area is situated atop the impressively flat roofs of two connected wagons.  Providing illumination, tiny flames dance within glass stars that are suspended between the pale blue fabric walls.  An assortment of garments is displayed on silver racks that hang from the dark blue ceiling."
