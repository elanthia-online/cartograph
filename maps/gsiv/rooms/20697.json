    "A small, level landing fits snugly into a rock alcove.  Shaped like an artist's palette, the landing has been carefully leveled, and a brilliant mosaic of clear, blue, and yellow quartz spells out a message on the floor.  An amber toadstool in a stone pot illuminates the area with a soft glow, its light playing off the mica flakes in the nearby wall.  The sound of rushing water permeates the area, and an oblong stone reflecting pool rests against the far wall."
