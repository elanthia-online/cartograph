    "A curved oak bar commands the far side of the party boat, clearly a place for libations and celebrations.  A scalloped, tattered banner frames the bar in faded colors of red and white, and stools of questionable integrity provide unstable seating.  A railing squares in an area for people to congregate away from the bar while taking in the soggy scenery of the swamp.  To the left of the bar, an oval door leads into the wheel room."
