    "The dank water of the bog runs slowly to the west, collecting in an impassable mire that seethes and emits bubbles of fetid gases as it seeps into the black waters of the creek.  A few raised patches of dirt provide insecure footing and purchase for a variety of scrawny plants, and the blackened roots of the surrounding trees rise from the bog like spectral knees."
