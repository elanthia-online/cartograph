    "To the north, the hilltop levels into an expansive plateau.  Bubbling lava pools dot the landscape, sending curling ribbons of smoke aloft like a skyline of belching chimneys over the rooftops of a town.  In the distance, the blue of open sea can be seen, with its shimmering reflections and low-riding clouds.  A large glaes formation on the south blocks the view in that direction."
