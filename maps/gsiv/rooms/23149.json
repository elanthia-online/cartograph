    "Rising at last to substantially higher ground, the path ends in this little den created in the embrace of close-pressing ferns.  Beneath the furls of greenery at the far edge of the space is a small straw-stuffed burrow in a hollowed tree trunk, which opens to face a small dancing bonfire.  On the opposite side of the burrow are a pair of logs for sitting, and between them is a tarnished bronze dish."
