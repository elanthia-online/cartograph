  "description": [
    "Padded training dummies are placed beside the long weapons rack that covers the western wall.  The floorboards have been removed at the center to reveal a white sand sparring area.  A series of mannequins display armor of all types beside a long footlocker.  A narrow corridor leads back to a room full of plain cots.  Small alcoves lead to tunnels with life-sized archery dummies and various targets.  The rear wall is dominated by a scarlet banner stitched with a fearsome direwolf bearing large fangs."
