    "A crooked, winding swath of blue paint cuts diagonally across the wooden floor like a river, dividing the room in half.  Above the blue paint, the room is decorated in dark hues resembling dead wood, while below the hues are light and green like a vibrant forest.  Two small fountains bubble in opposing corners of the room, while an odd pedestal table sits just off the center of the room."
