  "description": [
    "Ascending nearly thirty feet above the courtyard, stone walls bar escape into the unforgiving sea of sand beyond, a reality betrayed only by the howling winds and gusts of torrid air that seep through small apertures within the stone joints.  Alabaster columns edge the walkway, each wreathed in unfolding layers of copper scaling at the bottom."
