    "Stone buildings rise steeply on either side of the alley, their doors opening directly onto the street.  Most are built of the same granite that composes the central stones laid throughout the passage.  A turn in the alley creates a small pocket of open space in which pairs and trios of residents occasionally stop to gossip before hurrying away on business.",
