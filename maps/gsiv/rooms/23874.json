  "description": [
    "The aerial prop roots of a great banyan tree have been used here to suspend several platforms at varying heights, while the main trunk rises even higher into the air.  Deep grooves between the roots offer glimpses of the forest beyond, and some of them contain small offerings like bundles of herbs or dried flowers.  A set of parallel woven ropes extends to the east, affording tremulous travel at this height, while a thin wooden ramp extends to the southwest."
