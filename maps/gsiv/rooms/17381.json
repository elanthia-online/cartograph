    "Looming overhead is a dome of ebonwood and carmine crystal, reminiscent of a whelk's spiral shell.  Shards of ruby light filter through the smooth expanse of glass, gathering in nebulous pools about a central fountain fashioned into the conjoined forms of a bevy of nymphs.  Myriad white candles encircle the basin.  A rainbow glaes arch breaks the wall to the northeast, while double modwir doors to the south mute the bustle from the street beyond."
