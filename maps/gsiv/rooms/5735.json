    "Enclosed by numerous stout stalagmites, a little playground has been constructed for the smallest residents of Glarstim Cavern.  Children gleefully slide down the back of a giant metal snail while their parents watch from a ring of tables and benches carved from salt rock.  Other children find amusement on a pair of seesaws, swings, or climbing atop a massive cube strewn with holes."
