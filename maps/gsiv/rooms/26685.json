  "description": [
    "The deep blue darkness pulses serenely, each hypnotic and steady *swoosh* of water bringing a new wash of warmness or coolness with it.  Some startled creature buried in the sandbar darts off, sending up a storm of black sand that creeps toward you like a thick, roiling mist.  Caught up in a riptide's spiraling vortex, a large half-open oyster tumbles end over end nearby."
