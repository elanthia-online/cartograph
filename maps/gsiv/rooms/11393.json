    "Driven into the mortar between the blocks of the battlement is a rusting dagger framed by the fields of burning violets below, which flank the approach to the Citadel and the drawbridge.  Lying askew on the ground next to the wall is a pitted and rusted helmet with a panache of faded feathers."
