    "This area has been converted into a storeroom of sorts and contains row upon row of wooden shelves lashed to stone walls.  The strong mineral odor of the surrounding walls and floor does not quite overpower the persistent scent of herbs and spices that emanate from a wall-mounted drying rack.  A few burlap bags half-filled with grain remain on one of the shelves.  Empty barrels dot each corner of the room."
