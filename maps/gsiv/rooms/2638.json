  "description": [
    "An amazing pile -- more a mountain really -- of old chests and boxes inhabits this region of the cavern, rising up out of the drifts of fine sand, a monumental refuse heap of riches that have vanished.  The boxes are apparently empty, most of them gaped open and lying upon each other in various stages of decay like fallen soldiers.  Not even the tarnished hardware avoids the appearance of desolation."
