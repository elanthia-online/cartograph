    "Wane and tenebrous, an alpine breeze sets the saffron and gold leaves in the upper boughs of the nearby aspen trees to swaying and causes the sunlight to become dappled as it falls upon the snow-crested grasses.  Thin game trails disappear into the grove, meandering away from a canvas-woven domed enclosure that is surrounded by empty glass jars.  A simple shale and glass windchime sings a whimsical song as nearby movement sets it in motion."
