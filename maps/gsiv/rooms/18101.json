    "This room is rather warm and humid, though no source of climate control is apparent.  In the center, circumscribed by continuous, yellow-green walls, sits a pitted wooden workbench.  The domed walls rise from the stone floor to a round opening in the very top of the ceiling, which allows a few beams of stray moonlight to enter."
