    "A long-fanged yellow-eyed grinning gargoyle hangs on one of the silver-flecked alexandrite walls, and an ancient witchwood-beamed ceiling rises overhead.  A shadowy assassin statue gripping a serrarated longknife sits in one corner of a green marble-veined traffic worn brimstone floor.  There is a rolaren-reinforced ironwood Ardenai armor rack on one side of the shop and an ale-stained antique black slate bar with rickety wooden supports on the other."
