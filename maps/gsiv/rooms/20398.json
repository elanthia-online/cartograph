    "Creating a narrow corridor, large bales of hay line both sides of the hurling range.  A pair of modwir poles flying brilliant, alabaster silk streamers flanks a rounded white target.  Even from this distance, a large swamp spider can be seen in the center, with rings radiating out from its body."
