    "The broad sweep of the dark oak floor is interrupted by a plush black bear fur rug.  Halfway to the light oak ceiling, a curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls.  A set of carved felwood shelves and a heavy lead glass display case are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
