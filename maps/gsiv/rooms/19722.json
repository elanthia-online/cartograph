    "This part of the cavern is damp, bright and warm.  The dampness is caused by a myriad of rivulets of water that flow down the sides of the room.  The light and warmth are provided by five stones, firmly embedded in the rock wall, that emit a warm glow.  Under this light is growing a large patch of lichen and moss."
