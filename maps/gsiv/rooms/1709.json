    "Neither decoration nor torch adorns the stone walls of this small chamber.  Two cells, each containing a granite bench, are divided by mithril bars.  Upon one bench is a small skull, while the remainder of the skeleton is scattered about on the floor.  Three heavy bolts, each with a slight tinge of rust, stand ready to secure the heavy door."
