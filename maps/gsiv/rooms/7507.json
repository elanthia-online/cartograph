    "The tunnel continues here with little noticeable change.  Streaks of yellow and orange deposits smear the walls in places where the aquiferous stone has been cut through.  Droplets from that stone layer trickle down the walls to join the small flow in the center of the room.  Most of the crypts in this section have been picked clean by grave robbers long ago."
