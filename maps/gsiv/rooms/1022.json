  "description": [
    "The immense mountain range wraps around to the north, west and south to form a large bowl.  The mist in the valley below floats closely to the ground, undisturbed by the heavier winds aloft.  A few treetops protrude from the fog in the northern area of the valley and tops of boulders rise above the mist to the south."
