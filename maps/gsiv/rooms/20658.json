    "Suspended from the muraled ceiling are a series of fringed banners exquisitely embroidered with the names and likenesses of Zul Logoth's greatest warriors.  The panoramic image from above reflects clearly on the polished marble floor underfoot.  Cloves and other spices lightly scent the surroundings, emanating from further within the edifice."
