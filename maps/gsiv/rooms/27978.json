    "Lit with splinters of illumination that spear down from the edges of the ceiling, the cavern is narrow and shaped like a tall cylinder.  Roots of every shape and size curl about the walls, completely covering them in a mass of brambles, the only area clear of them a natural stone arch that leads into luminescent space."
