    "To the west, the rocky shoreline grows even more rugged and broken.  Enormous granite boulders the size of houses lie tumbled and cracked open and a goodly portion of the cliff above you has crumbled onto the beach.  To the west, one massive boulder dominates your view, a grey flecked monster that a legion of Gnolls could not reduce to gravel in a century."
