  "description": [
    "A gurgling swift-flowing stream interrupts the path of scattered and broken cobblestones, spanning the length of two men across the leafy floor.  Its depth is unclear, but the dark hue of the waters suggests that its passage has worn a considerable channel through the woods.  A pale granite outcropping, lying just a short leap from the pebbled bank, emerges from the dark waters and might provide a safe and easy means of crossing to the other side.",
