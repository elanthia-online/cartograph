  "description": [
    "Shafts of sunlight spear through the glaes dome, warming the smooth matte of clay tiles set into the floor of this vast chamber.  Hand painted with soft muted colors, the tiles are patterned to mirror the cerulean blue sky above on a clear day.  A whirl of pale white streaks across the surface of the tiles, barely clouding the glorious gold of the sun, adding the final touch to the celestial mosaic.  Brightly lit halls fork from the side of the chamber, leading further into the majestic temple."
