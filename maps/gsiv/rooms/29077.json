  "description": [
    "Pale grey rock lines the walls, ceiling, and floor in this tight space.  Sunight from the southeast filters in from the entrance, but its rays reach no further than halfway down the narrow tunnel.  A slight rut has been worn away down the middle, showing where the passing of many feet has eroded the surface of the floor."
