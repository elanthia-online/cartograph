    "A variety of glass tables made of various colors and designs clutter the display portion of an apprentice glazier's workspace.  Heat from a kiln in the corner of the workshop is a reminder of the dangers in making fine glass products.  Bits of broken glass and small buckets of colored sand are kept far away from the display tables, for the safety of the shoppers."
