    "A fountain made from a large rock jutting out of a white basin dominates the garden here.  Water pours from small, fish-shaped golden spouts on the side of the rock, trickling down over the edges of the overflowing basin to irrigate the flora.  A stone bench framed by verdant hedges provides seating to enjoy the tranquil atmosphere."
