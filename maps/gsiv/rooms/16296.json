    "Cobblestones begin at the bridge's foot, escorting the avenue along its path, which winds between a dense cluster of immaculate cottages.  Grouting the stones, green moss grows, adding the contrast of its verdant color to the stones' grey palette.  At various points along the road sit carved statuary, depicting rabbits, toads and other small woodland creatures."
