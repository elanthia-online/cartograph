    "Hemmed in by sheer cliff walls, the couloir is quite narrow, and in conjuction with the steep gradient, passage is harrowing at best.  Unfortunately, the tight space is completely cast in darkness, adding unnecessary degrees of difficulty in navigation.  The only sound audible in this deep mountain gash is the steady howl of rushing air from a windy vortex, punctuated by the occasional scream.",

Unfortunately, sunlight has little reach into this gash in the mountain, casting the tight space completely in shadow.  The steady howl of rushing air from a windy vortex is punctuated by the occasional scream."
