    "Verdant foliage pigments the eastern horizon as a small island stands out against the bright blue of the rolling waves.  Stretching outward from its purchase upon the fertile land, a long wooden dock supported by tall pylons is surrounded by dozens of boats and offers space for a ferry to deposit its passengers."
