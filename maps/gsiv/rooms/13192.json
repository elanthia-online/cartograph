    "Bordered by a well-maintained but spartan lawn, the training yard's hard riverstone tiles lead up to a whitewashed stone tower.  Moonlight creeps through the branches of a weeping willow tree bending over the eastern half of the courtyard, which is severed from the street by a stygian steel gate.  Numerous training dummies with battered bodies litter the yard, posted on solid oak stakes.",
