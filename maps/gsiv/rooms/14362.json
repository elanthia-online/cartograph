    "Opening up into a towering room, beams of blue and green stream down from the clerestory windows, bright with the light of the sun.  Immaculate white limestone walls surround the nave on all sides, carved with a cresting wave that looks like it is rolling in towards the center.  Pale haon benches are arranged in a semi-circle around the chancel, separated by a mistwood banister, open in alignment with the main aisle.",
