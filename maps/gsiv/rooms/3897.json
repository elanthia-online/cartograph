    "To the west, an ancient stone bridge stretches across a north-south ravine, but the road veers northward, then arcs back to the south and enters the ravine just north of the bridge.  Looking more closely, you see that the ravine has ceased to be an obstacle.  Decades of silt have been topped off with a roadbed of gravel, and the ravine now provides a comfortable descent to the tidal marshes below."
