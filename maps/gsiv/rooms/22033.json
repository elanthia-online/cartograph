    "Along this wall of the expansive tent, loops of varying shades of flowers have been strung together across a partially closed curtain that leads to makeshift living quarters.  The customer traffic is less noticeable here, though the steady buzz of perusing shoppers and their companions can be overheard from the southeast.  A polished maoral stool stands off to the side of the space, a lit spherical lantern hung close to it providing ample lighting for detailed mercantile or textile work."
