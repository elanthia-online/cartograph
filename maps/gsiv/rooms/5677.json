  "description": [
    "Wide, polished columns of deep black marble ascend toward the ceiling, a contrast to the pure white walls of the chamber.  Set between the low pillars is an altar of flawless ivory, elaborately inlaid with bloodjewels and a base twined with thorny, carved brambles.  Overlooking the altar, a statue of a young man with his arms stretched above his head, casts a slight shadow across the room."
