    "Crushed stone forms this plain path that cuts between the curtained training galleries, ending at a single gallery at the end of the walkway.  Tall, smooth pillars support thin curtains of various colors, giving a semblance of privacy to the otherwise open space.  To one side sit rooms swathed in green and white, while the other side boasts curtains of black and blue.  The room at the end is graced with twists of brilliant red silk, the layout paying homage to Lumnis' spheres of knowledge."
