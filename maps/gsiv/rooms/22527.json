  "description": [
    "Thick oak poles support this once fine tent.  Showing the wear of time, the inside of the tent is patched in a multitude of places.  Mismatched lengths of canvas, leather, and cloth have been sewn into the fabric of the tent to help keep the elements out.  Various bits of weaponry are haphazardly shoved into a wooden barrel, while an aged wooden weapon rack, sitting on a grungy wool rug, holds a variety of merchandise.  Hanging from one of the oak poles, a dingy curtain provides access to a small workspace in the rear of the tent."
