    "A rough wooden altar stands in the center of the clearing, surrounded by a bountiful abundance of Imaera's Lace growing in wild profusion.  Moonlight silvers the white blooms of Imaera's Lace but does little to illuminate the other plant life intermingled with the flowers.  An abandoned bird feeder swings from a nearby tree limb above a partially shadowed oak bench.",
    "A rough wooden altar stands in the center of the clearing, surrounded by a bountiful abundance of Imaera's Lace growing in wild profusion.  Encircling the white blooms of Imaera's Lace are touches of purple from the wild violets that have grown in the rich soil.  An abandoned bird feeder swings from a nearby tree limb above a partially shaded oak bench."
