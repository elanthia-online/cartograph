    "Beautiful teak molding adorns the white walls of the hallway that leads further into the guild.  A pair of tall, arcing windows look out into a lush garden that is bright with blooming flowers.  Verdant ferns hang down over the polished marble pedestal that stands on display next to a wood framed archway draped with pale silk."
