    "The slight elevation in the trail is enough to raise it above the mist.  The small knoll is like an island entirely surrounded by wispy grey mist.  Only a few small, twisted trees are visible above the mist, their branches looking pathetic in the moonlight.  The path, though apparently more solid than the soil elsewhere, is spongy under foot.",
