  "description": [
    "This heavily forested trail cuts sharply up and down the steep slopes high in the foothills of the Trollfang Mountains.  There are many large boulders and short cliff faces, and the trail meanders between these various obstacles.  To the northwest a path leads up along a high ridge that stretches out to the west."
