  "description": [
    "Arcing high above, the verdant dome of the Vallis Elementum is fashioned of arcane energy that forms a protective shield over the lunar landscape.  Bright white stone, pitted from past impacts, is illuminated by the verdant green forcefield that thrums through the area and is punctuated by the heartbeat-like pulsing of a nearby teleportation disk.  Visible beyond the recondite enchantment, the endless void of space fills the horizon with its unyielding darkness."
