  "description": [
    "Illuminated from above, the triangular chamber's air is heavily scented with myrrh.  Matching the shape of the room, a small dais supports a three-sided stone altar crafted of smooth grey, white, and black tiles.  Three corridors exit deeper into the mountain, while the archway in the eastern wall leads to a landing and the stairs beyond."
