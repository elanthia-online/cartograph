    "Within the airy cavern, a clearing resides in the middle of a prolific number of stalagmites that rise over twenty feet into the air.  Only a few paths are navigable through the rock formations, each marked by a giant toadstool.  Portions of the ground have been stained in different colors, delineating the various training areas available."
