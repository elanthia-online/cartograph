    "The table is made of teak and its circular top is elegantly carved, depicting the curve of violin necks, the arch of lutes and other graceful instruments played by the caress of a bow.  Below, the pedestal flares as it nears the floor, decorated with black-tinted pegs, as though the structure would need a tuning now and then.  A lantern in the center of the top bears crossed bows above its lyre-shaped base."
