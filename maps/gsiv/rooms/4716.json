    "A thick carpet of pine needles obscures the cobblestones as the trees crowd even closer to the pathway.  The needles crunch underfoot, softly echoing through the forest and then back, creating the impression of many more traveling feet.  Although the needles are quite dry, the surrounding trees appear to be lush and green, giving the impression that this area receives ample rainfall."
