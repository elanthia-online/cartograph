  "description": [
    "A life-sized statue of a giantman wielding dual claidhmores guards the entrance to the hall.  A series of oil-lit chandeliers hang from the ceiling, brightening the area.  Dozens of cushioned high back chairs are arranged around a large circular hoarbeam table.  A display case housing battered elven armor stands along the eastern wall.  An enormous fireplace with a large polar bear rug arranged in front, and an eloquent faewood plaque hanging above it take up almost one wall."
