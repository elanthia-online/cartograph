    "A half-crumbled ring of stones circles the black maw of an ancient well, its rim nearly concealed by endless layers of fallen leaves and soil.  The gnarled forms of yews and black oaks extend their grasping branches in an interwoven canopy that reduces the day's light to a faint, shifting glow.",
