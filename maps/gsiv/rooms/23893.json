    "Dimly lit, this interior room is built directly into the trunk of the tree, its roughly hewn walls exuding the sweet smell of cedar.  The only light in the room filters in from a knothole in one wall, and a single small lantern set into a niche in another.  A woven grass rug covers the relatively level floor, and a bench has been carved directly in the wall adjacent to the lantern."
