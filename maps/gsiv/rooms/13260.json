  "description": [
    "Fog drifts off the slate-grey surface of Lough Ne'halin in thick clouds like ghostly behemoths.  A few lights twinkle through the mists from the scythe-shaped shore stretching around the lake's western shoulder.  The booming of bull-frogs echoes across water, erupting intermittently from within tufts of grass along the bank.  A trail winds through the reedy grass which grows to the lake's edge."
