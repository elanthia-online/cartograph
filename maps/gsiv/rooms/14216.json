    "The path curves around the boggy edge of Moonlight Pool, its edge marked by tall water reeds.  Bull frogs and lesser amphibians sing a mixed chorus from the protection of the grasses.  Cottages built along the curved bank sit contemplating the mirror-like surface of the water, dotted intermittently with loons swimming at the far end."
