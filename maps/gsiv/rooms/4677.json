    "Oak beams riddle the space above this platform, the lacquered wood offering support to the platform above.  Dangling from hemp ropes fitted into the underside of the platform above are large pot-bellied bottles filled with colorful dyes that create a prismatic spray across the entire platform as the sunlight strikes.  Banners of multi-hued silk create a gentle barrier at the platform's edges, making them safe from a long drop to the brook below."
