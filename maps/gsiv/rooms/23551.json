  "description": [
    "With floor-to-ceiling windows and creamy ivory walls, this room is a showcase of statuary and exhibits.  Stretching across one side, a long glass case protects an array of important and delicate items.  In contrast, displays of battle memorabilia command attention throughout the rest of the room, plush benches scattered between.  A spiral staircase affixed with a sign leads upward, while a guard stationed near a graceful arch prevents casual visitors from further exploration."
