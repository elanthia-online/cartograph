    "Plain wooden walls rise from an unfinished wooden floor.  Just above a multicolored giant toy rolton hangs a tattered merchant permit, and an uneven wooden ceiling completes the picture.  An oval-shaped speckled marble counter and a gilded maple table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
