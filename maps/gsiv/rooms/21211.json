    "Bright light spills into the passage from the southeast, its cheery glow providing ample illumination by which to see.  Smooth cobblestones shape the floor, walls and ceiling, their flat surfaces dimpled with grey and white hues.  From somewhere to the northwest travels the sound of crashing waves."
