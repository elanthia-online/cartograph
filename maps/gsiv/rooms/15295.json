    "Beneath a verdigris lichen-covered grey granite ceiling, an array of blood-stained chains and shackles hangs on one of the blood-stained chiseled granite walls.  A deeply-grooved blackened marble altar and a deeply-stained chipped marble reliquary sit in opposite corners while a scattering of moldy straw and rags rests on the granite slab floor."
