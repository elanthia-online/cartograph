    "A small cart of crates leans against the remains of a tall wooden tower, the wares either rotted away or missing from the straw-filled containers.  The riveted tower doors have been barricaded from the outside, the signs of fire damage evident from the scorch marks grasping the windows above.  A reddish-black substance oozes from beneath the entrance, the trails puddling within the deep grooves of boot prints stamped upon the ground."
