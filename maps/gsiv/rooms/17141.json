    "Specifically aligned, three chairs rest in front of a lightly carved desk.  Arranged side by side on the desktop, miniature portraits of a child and a woman in her middle years are on display in ivory frames.  In the far corner, standing roughly three feet high, a plainly made wooden horse bears the burden of holding a brass-riveted saddle.  Smaller wood sculptures of a wolf, a caribou, and a snow leopard carved in amazing detail surround the horse in a semi-circle."
