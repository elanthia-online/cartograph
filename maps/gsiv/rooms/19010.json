    "The bustle of crowds making their way between secular centers of town that converge here carries people along with its momentum.  The granite and marble facade of the First Provincial Bank stands solidly, a strange-looking guard armed with pike and crossbow posted at the door.  A number of well-dressed reptiles congregate outside.  Dwarves, elves, halflings and humans move in the crowd, but there are also more snakelike creatures, gnomes and furry, catlike sorts, although no one seems to take notice."
