    "Ropes of woven ribbon and glittering beads are wound through the iron archway in the southwest wall.  Mithril mesh baskets hang from long chains anchored in the pitted stone ceiling, and each basket is overflowing with alpine flowers.  A trio of gilded iron sconces imbedded in the striated stone walls bears huge torches that illuminate the small cavern with flickering golden light."
