    "Row upon row of trellises line this portion of the grove, each overgrown with grape vines.  A solitary squirrel nibbling on the fruit seems undeterred by the constant parade of heavily armed men and women strolling nearby.  The small vineyard is well tended and looks to be more than just a hobby for somebody."
