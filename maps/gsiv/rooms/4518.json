    "Rush mats cover the floor, providing a place to sit.  Each mat can easily hold four or five bodies comfortably.  Set on the back wall, as far from the wooden door as possible is a single stone chair cut from the very chamber wall.  A large round pedestal stands in the center of the room bearing a few snacks."
