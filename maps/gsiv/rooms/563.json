    "From the foot of a beautiful, old arched bridge, the trail disappears into the darkness of the forest.  The trees have grown closely together, with formidable undergrowth prohibiting casual entry at any point other than the path.  Beneath the bridge, the stream courses swiftly with an accompanying roar, its roiling surface glistening in the moonlight.",

Beneath the bridge, the stream courses swiftly with an accompanying roar, throwing up sprays of water as it hurtles between rocks lying in its bed."
