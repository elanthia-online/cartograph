    "Long and rectangular, this room encompasses about half of the front facade of the building.  The hardwood floor is kept free from debris and snow by an absorbent rug resting by the door leading out.  With stone bricks comprising the bottom half of the walls and wood planks making up the top, the room has a rustic feel, amplified by the wrought iron lanterns that illuminate the area from their perch in niches along the walls.  Near the entry, a white wooden table holds a variety of glittering objects."
