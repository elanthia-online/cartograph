  "description": [
    "Oak paneling rises from the limestone floors covered in a tapestry-weave royal blue runner down the stretch of corridor, which ends in a steel-banded door.  A pair of brass sconces fitted with glass globes are affixed to the wall to either side of the door, the candles within burning softly to illuminate the area.  To the south, the corridor stretches towards the distant reception area, the entire length lined with comfortable furnishings and bookcases."
