  "description": [
    "The high stone walled room is rather featureless, save for a towering statue which dominates the center of the room.  The statue appears to be that of a heavily armored swordsman, his sword pointed downward as if judging all who enter.  Opposite the Hall's entrance, you can see another set of double doors leading to the courtroom."
