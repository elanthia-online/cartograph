    "Dreamstones have been inlaid along the top of the grey stone walls in an irregular pattern of waves, barely visible above the towering ebonwood bookcases that dominate all four sides of the room.  Above the varied tomes, the ceiling has been studded with starstone in the outlines of the night sky.  A large witchwood desk rests in the center of the room."
