  "description": [
    "Resting against one pale silk wall, a trio of mannequins show off their elegant island finery.  Lengths of carved tigerwood form the frame of the large tent with a center pole, wrapped in swathes of colorful material, creating a peaked ceiling.  A beautiful mirror framed in carved driftwood is centered on the soft, vibrantly patterned carpet."
