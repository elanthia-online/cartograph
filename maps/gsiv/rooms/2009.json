  "description": [
    "Shadowy trees stretch away up the lower slopes of the great volcano, above a deep fissure barring the way.  Curling down the mountainside like an old knife wound, it cuts as far as the eye can see to the west.  Steam rises out of the fissure and rolls along the ground to the south, lit from beneath by an angry red glow.  Surprisingly, the mistwoods thrive even at the very edge of the precipice."
