    "A thin spire of pure ice ascends toward the heavens, its narrow spiked peak glittering with reflected sunlight.  Two tall modwir trees flank the enormous structure, their needle-covered branches dusted with a heavy coating of snow.  Small grey rocks peek out from the layer of white upon the ground, marking two paths that lead to the large tower and off to a smaller building situated near the southeastern wall.",
