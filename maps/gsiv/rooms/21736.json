    "An abundance of color fills the land surrounding the calm water disturbed only by a small waterfall that flows over the perimeter wall.  A short, partially concealed tunnel can be seen behind the flow of water.  A large wooden dock extends into the water, providing a dry walkway to a small island in the lake where Blubber's ice cream stand awaits.  A group of wide trees emerging from the water's edge support a small hammock and an oak swing."
