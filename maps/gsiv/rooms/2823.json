  "description": [
    "As the altitude rises, the air grows more crisp and biting, full of the rich aroma manufactured by the pines.  The bluff is a narrow ridge of stone, banded on the north by thick stands of trees, and open to the wind on the south, where the trail disappears down into the jumble of boulders creating a steep incline."
