    "Green stains from algae cling to the whimsical curves that adorn the crumbling walls.  Blackened bronze pots are filled with soot and fine-grained debris that has accumulated over time.  A large chunk of the roof stands in the center of the hallway, leaving only narrow paths around the impediment."
