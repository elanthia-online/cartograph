  "description": [
    "A wide vista can be viewed from the top of the boulder.  To the west all of Maelstrom Bay and the great western sea spreads out before you.  To the north and east, obscure in the gloom of night, are the rolling hills of the Shattered Moors.  To the south the land dips down into darkness.  A moonlit tower rises beyond the marsh to the southeast.  Some small bones are lodged in a crevice of the boulder.",
