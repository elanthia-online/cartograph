    "The broken dreams of long dead men, covered and reclaimed by the wild impulses of nature, stand barely discernible from the untouched growth of the land beside the river.  Trees and bushes intermingle with what might have once been statuary, fusing the art of nature with that of mortal hand.  An overgrown pathway, barely wider than a game path, leads away from the ruined port and toward a large bald mound."
