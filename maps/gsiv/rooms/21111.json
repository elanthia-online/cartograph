    "The most prominent thing about this room is the lack of any sturdy overhead protection due to collapsed stone walls and a falling archway.  A finely thatched roof makes for temporary protection from the weather, though a heavy storm would threaten its stability.  This portion of the library has been cleared of all books and shelving, though stone desks and wooden chairs are scattered about the room."
