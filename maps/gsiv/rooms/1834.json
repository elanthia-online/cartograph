  "description": [
    "The trail winds its way into the edge of the forest, twisting around enormous tree trunks and bushes so tall and thick they stand higher than a giantman.  Odd vines climb the trees, twisting in a sinuous pattern around the trunks and draping themselves across limbs with a snake-like grace."
