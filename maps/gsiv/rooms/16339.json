    "A series of stained glass windows, each decorated with wild tropical blooms, casts a myriad of rainbow hues upon the lush white carpeting that blankets the room.  Sconces upon the walls house tiny copper-sided lanterns, their faces depicting the cut-out images of fireflies, damselflies, and dragonflies.  Comfortable chairs arranged in tidy rows all face the northern section of the hall where a podium is set upon a dais.",
    "A series of stained glass windows, each decorated with wild tropical blooms, seem dark and faded.  Sconces upon the walls house tiny copper-sided lanterns, their faces depicting the cut-out images of fireflies, damselflies, and dragonflies that cast a warm glow upon the plush white carpeting that blankets the room.  Comfortable chairs arranged in tidy rows all face the northern section of the hall where a podium is set upon a dais."
