  "description": [
    "A large, decrepit building stands on the top of a small hillock here.  Vines cover most of the building, avoiding only the dark stains running from the windows and roof.  The stains are a dark red or brown, giving the appearance the building has been sweating blood.  A weathered metal sign hangs just above the entryway, creaking in the non-existant breeze."
