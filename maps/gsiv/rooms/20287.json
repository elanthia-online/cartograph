  "description": [
    "Cast iron kettles of soups and stews hang from heavy hooks above the embers in a large open fireplace.  Bread dough, covered with clean linen cloths, rests upon long wooden counters, rising in preparation for the next baking.  Assorted spices, in square metal tins, are neatly arrayed in wall-mounted racks.  Despite the bright light that floods the central area, the kitchen's corners are couched in darkness."
