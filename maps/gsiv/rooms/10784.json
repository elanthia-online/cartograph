    "A breeze rolls up the side of the ridgeline, bringing cold, dry air from the valley below.  Strangely, the top of the ridgeline seems to be warmer than the area below it.  Perhaps this is due to the presence of heavily sheltered but rather dry areas down below, but it is impossible to see through the thick deciduous forest in order to make any definite analysis.  The wind seems to have affected the growth along the ridgeline, as the forest stands quite a distance from the edge."
