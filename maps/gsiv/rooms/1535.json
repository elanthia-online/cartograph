  "description": [
    "This far south of the Vornavis Canal, the manors and walled estates have given way to half-timbered townhouses competing for every bit of space on South 'Haven's platform.  Grebe Lane narrows visibly to the west as the structures have been built inch-by-inch further into the street.  Open sky diminishes also, the second stories of most of these buildings having been built to overhang the street rather than straight above their first floors."
