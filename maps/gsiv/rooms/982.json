    "A number of dwarves hurry by, some in groups, some alone, always bundled up heavily against the elements and moving with determination as if to stop would mean instant freezing.  Several businesses butt up to the roadway to offer their services to passersby.  Not far overhead, clouds move quickly across the sky, driven onward by the constant wind, and occasionally one is low enough to drag a chilling fog through the area as it scurries past."
