  "description": [
    "Barely more than a shelf extending from the side of the Citadel, the balcony is protected behind a low wall equipped with metal quivers and several arrow slits.  The breadth of the Citadel complex is laid out to the north, with the nearby gardens and the alchemist building, beyond which the armory and the garrison stand in a stoic line.  Randomly, the wind carries past the balcony the animal screams of the distant zoo."
