    "The walls are devoid of mica, their rough dark grey surfaces illuminated by several large, glowing toadstools that sprout directly from the roughly hewn stone floor.  A huge geode, split in half and filled with clear lacquer, serves as a bench, and a stone shelf hangs on the wall within arm's reach.  A descending stone staircase allows passage down through a hole in the floor.  Carved directly into the rock, a round window peers out onto the cavern below, and a western passage leads toward the sound of rushing water."
