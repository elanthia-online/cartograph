    "Wooden tables are set in orderly rows down the length of the building, their tops crowned and overflowing with plants of all descriptions.  Against the exterior wall, herbs grow from their loamy flats, and the center aisle is filled with flowering plants.  The large floor tiles in the building are covered with a plush carpet of moss, coaxed into abundance by the heavy humidity."
