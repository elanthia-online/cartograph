    "Vast lancet arches of uniform granite raise this wide platform far above the floodline of the Cairnfang River, its low stone walls lined with staggered crenellations.  Paved setts fan out from the barbican of a far higher rampart, while one embrasure of the wall hosts a long stone dock.  Past the wall, azure-on-white pennons soar above from the turrets of a tall sun-basked keep, made stark against the bright sky.  Yet, as if welcoming, a statue enshrined within a low stone garden before the gatehouse.",
