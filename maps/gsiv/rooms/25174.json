  "description": [
    "The chamber opens up into a huge columned hall with a series of faceted domed ceilings.  Overhead, the radiance of the moons streams through the glass, sending innumerable platinum specks scattering across the tiled stonework floor.  A small desert ironwood ironwood panel rests inside of a niche embracing the pale sandstone walls."
