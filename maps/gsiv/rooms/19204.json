  "description": [
    "Repetitive apologies fill this half of the closet, as patrons bump into each other trying to reach some heavy stone hooks above the fat tallow candles that light the interior.  A gold-washed emerald green rack provides both an interesting centerpiece and insurmountable obstacle to those who have flattened themselves against the back wall."
