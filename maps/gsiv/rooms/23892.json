    "A lofted platform creates this room, and curtains of vines surround the rough wooden floor on all sides.  A single low counter runs the entire length of the platform toward the back, and a simple woven mat rests on the floor.  Naturally occurring, a knothole in the cedar tree affords a glimpse of a dark interior, its rough edges offer tricky passage."
