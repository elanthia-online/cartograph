  "description": [
    "The rancid smell of rot and decay is almost overwhelming here.  A huge compost heap, piled high with unidentifiable refuse and debris is the source of the disgusting odor.  There has been no sign of any agriculture in or around the village that would make use of the fertilizer provided by the huge compost heap, so this may simply have been a trash dump for the village."
