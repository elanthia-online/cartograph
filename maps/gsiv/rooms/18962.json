    "Shelves line the east and west walls while entrances to the alchemical workrooms fan out to the north and south.  The ceiling and floors pulse in a slow, deliberate rhythm, their edges concealed by, or possibly composed of, an opaque black mist.  A circular work surface, fitted with mortars at each compass point, occupies the center of the room."
