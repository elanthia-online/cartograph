    "Scrub grasses push up here and there from the sandy pathway, giving it an almost mottled look.  More torches have been set out here to light the path.  Small palm trees grow unchecked in various places along the walkway, their fronds not much higher than the heads of passersby.  Through the trees on one side you see a large sandstone building.",
