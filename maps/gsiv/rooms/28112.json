    "The trees begin their gradual creep up the mountainside at this branch of the forest.  The path north is twisted and rocky, bending out of sight behind a wall of crooked, snow-laden spruces.  To the west, fresh paw prints mark a gently downhill sloping trail away from the mountain and deeper into the woods."
