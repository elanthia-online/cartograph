    "A spiral staircase climbs up to third floor of the temple, and is flanked on either side by a large stone statue carved to resemble a large water droplet.  The flooded water reaches to the statues' middles, where wavy patterns have been formed by years of erosion.  A single tapestry, soaked with moisture, hangs from the northwestern wall, and a rusted iron bar rests opposite it."
