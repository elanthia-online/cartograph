    "The majority of the ceiling in the room lies in pieces alongside its walls.  As a result, the room is flooded with moonlight and a great sense of openess.  The only shadow is found by a workbench, provided by the star-silhouetted leaves of trees outside in the encroaching jungle.  Several abandoned bird nests line the walls of the room, attesting to previous occupants."
