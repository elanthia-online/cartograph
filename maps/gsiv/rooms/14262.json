    "An armor stand is set back against the wall between a pair of long oak weapon racks.  Monstrously large iron-bound chests stand open in the center of the floor, their insides filled with miscellaneous gear.  A row of heavy wall pegs support coiled cords, triggers, and springs, while a series of oak shelves is filled with rags and tar kits."
