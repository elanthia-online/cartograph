  "description": [
    "Devoid of vegetation, the ground has been cleared surrounding a modest hut in the center of the space.  Its walls are a collection of mismatched lengths of planking, and its roof consists of a flat sheet of rusted metal.  Tiny clay pots flank the simple doorway, each brimming with a carefully tended collection of weeds."
