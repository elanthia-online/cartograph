    "Separated from the other side of the barracks by a pair of oak-framed cotton mattress bunkbeds, this end houses a pair of weathered desks framing a riverstone fireplace.  A small rug rests upon the floor, its worn expanse covered with several wicker-backed polished maple chairs arranged in conversational groups with small tables set between them."
