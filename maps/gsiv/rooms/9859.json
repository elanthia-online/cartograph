    "There is a slight bend to the gully as it curves around the slope to the west.  This seems to be an old streambed, still lined in water-tumbled pebbles and patches of dry moss.  A velvety green caterpillar is working its way up a mottled, shaggy trunk, searching for the simplest path to its unknown goal."
