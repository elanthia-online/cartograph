    "Stretching from one end of the room to the other is an enormous bar, its glossy surface illuminated by glaesine orbs that dangle from the ceiling.  Surrounding the bar are several some wooden stools, their spindle legs carved into the shape of dragonflies and their backs embossed with the image of luna moths.  Brighter lights spill in from the commons to the north, while sunlight streaks across the teak floors from the open doors.",
