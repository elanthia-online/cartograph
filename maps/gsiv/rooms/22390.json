    "Shaped into the form of a flower in bloom, this center room is framed by smooth log pieces seamlessly fitted together.  Surrounded by an inlaid marble floor of leaf-patterned mosaic, a tall silver tree serves as the focal point.  Sunlight glints from its outstretched branches, each one a realistically knotted length of argent metal.  A path of natural riverstones leads back to the garden."
