  "description": [
    "Darkness blankets the jungle floor, far from the moonlight's reach.  Insects swarm over a fallen log, the smell of fresh, damp soil mingling with the earthy scent of rotting wood.  Both high above and on the ground, all manner of creatures battle for any space not already occupied by greenery.  Knobby, blossom-laden trumpetvines spread over the thick trunks of towering trees, creating a symbiotic relationship between tree, vine, and the insects that the heavily perfumed vines attract."
