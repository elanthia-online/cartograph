    "A battlemented gatehouse on the west side of the road overarches the gateway to Baron's Quay.  Clearly a military fortification built to guard the mouth of the Vornavis Canal, a closed portcullis -- well-lit by lanterns -- and four guards prevent anyone not wearing Vornavis Guard livery from entering.  Tidewater Road turns inland to avoid the small backwater built in the lee of Baron's Quay.",
