    "The roar of the rushing water within the parallel crevice combines with the howling wind to render conversation a difficult task, even if one is only talking to oneself.  The crevice turns sharply, defining the trail to be westward and southward.  Small crevices converge with the much larger one, either causing a moment's inconvenience in the form of a small jump or a large detour to find a safer crossing."
