  "description": [
    "Covering the floor are squares of black marble polished to sheer perfection and the superb luster gives the impression of being more like a black liquid than stone.  Cast upon the mirror-like surface of the floor is a perfect reflection of the crystal chandelier hanging overhead.  Soft tinkling sounds emanate from the crystals as it sways gently back and forth from its chain, created by the breeze of the opened doorway.  An impressive statue of Rone Wehnimer nearly blocks a massive iron arch."
