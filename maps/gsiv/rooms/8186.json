    "This huge, circular cavern glitters pink and gold and green around the edges, fading to sparkling white in the center.  In the middle of the room, you see a round pool full of milky liquid, its surface disturbed by the drops that drip off of a great white stalactite hanging from the center of the ceiling.  The PLOP, PLOP, PLOP echoes throughout the room and beyond."
