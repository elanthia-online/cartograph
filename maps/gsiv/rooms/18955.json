    "The walls, floor and ceiling of this chamber are solid, seamless, unbroken ice.  Illumination arises from the glowing floor.  There, underneath the ice, veins of crimson energy flow from the walls toward the center of the room.  The rivers of energy pulsate, matching the deep thumping of an unseen beating heart."
