  "description": [
    "What distinguishes this portion of the jungle is the abundant growth of rafflesia, many of the fungi in bloom with their enormous flame-hued flowers.  Lying low to the ground, the parasitic plants attach to the root systems of the multitude of liana vines growing up the trunks and limbs of a tight stand of rubber trees.  The stench given off by the rafflesia blooms is pervasive, similar to that of rotting flesh and attracting flies by the hundreds.",

Lying low to the ground, the parasitic plants attach to the root systems of the multitude of liana vines growing up the trunks and limbs of a tight stand of rubber trees and a single ancient banyan tree.
