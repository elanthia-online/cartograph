  "description": [
    "Lined up beyond the glass counter is a wall of baking racks that are cooling their delectable treats, while a small spit, fitted into a riverstone fireplace, turns a slow-roasting leg of lamb.  Chilled fruits are arranged within the display upon slabs of rhimar, while tureens of soup and vegetables are kept warm by glowing drakar slabs.  An open frosted glass door leads into the foyer beyond, where the sound of a soft lute can be heard playing a sweet tune."
