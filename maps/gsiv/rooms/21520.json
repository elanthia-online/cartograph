    "The wagon's interior is quite open in the center, with the walls splashed in a soft shade of off-white.  Flanking the back wall, an ivory shrine stands illuminated by a haze of pale light, and toward the left is a more dimly lit onyx shrine.  A mosaic of white marble and jet completely blankets the floor in bold, contrasting colors, leading to a glaes-framed doorway.",
