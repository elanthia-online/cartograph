    "Panels of deep black ebonwood line the ceiling, their precise positioning contrasted by the intricate, swirled designs racing across their surface in a veritable whirlwind of beauty.  Rows of long arched windows line the walls, the sunlight filtering in casting a bright sheen upon the polished wooden dancing floor.  A long oak bar stands in a corner to the south, its top glistening with reflected light."
