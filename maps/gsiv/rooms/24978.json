    "Skeletal trees stand guard along either side of the road, their tendril-like branches providing seating for a trio of emaciated vultures hovering above, their loud cries echoing loudly across the sky.  The dusty path shifts with changes in the wind, covering random strips of fabric and shards of metal that have accumulated along the way."
