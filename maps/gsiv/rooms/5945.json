    "Heaps of warped and withered wood litter the ground.  Sections of the old tracks used to carry rocks and other minerals to the outside are visible from underneath the rubbish.  A twisted, slender pipe runs the length of the western wall.  Drops of water seep from a small hole in the pipe, which is creating a small pool of mud."
