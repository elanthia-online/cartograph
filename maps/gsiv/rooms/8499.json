    "The old altar sits overlooking the sanctuary.  From here, the shadows seem deeper, the silence more ominous, as if the sonorous breathing of a majestic life had suddenly ceased, leaving you alone and afraid.  Set into the wall behind the altar is a massive glass window, not yet broken, although a creeping dark stain has spread over it, turning the colors an unwholesome red-black.  Some marble stairs lead down into darkness, providing an alternative to going back to the sanctuary itself."
