    "A thick oak beam runs high overhead supporting the roof of the pavilion, with burnished bronze lamps hanging from it on invar chains.  Rich burgundy ramie silks form the interior walls, appearing lustrous and sleek in the flickering lamp light.  A polished cherrywood table stands atop the plush velvet rug in the center of the room."
