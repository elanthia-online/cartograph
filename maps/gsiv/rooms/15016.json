    "A painted silk wall panel hangs on one of the glazed bamboo walls, and a sturdy bamboo-rafter ceiling rises overhead.  An elegantly woven reed mat sits in one corner of an intricate patterned floor.  There is a warped treasure chest on one side of the shop and an aqua-hued seaglass display on the other."
