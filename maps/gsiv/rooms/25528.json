  "description": [
    "The thin stretch of planking overlooks the lowered main deck on one side, and the Firebird's port propellers on the other.  All that stands between a clumsy passenger and a fatal topple over the side of the ship is fireleaf railing that is heavily gilded and bright with red brass ornamentation."
