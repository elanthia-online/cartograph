    "Thousands of scrolls sit neatly in an oversized bookshelf, each neatly placed in its own beautifully lacquered pigeonhole and clearly labelled.  A drawing table erected in the corner has a piece of fresh clean parchment tacked to it, and several pots of tightly closed ink sit nearby, ready for use.  A huge skylight above showers the small, clean shop with soft light."
