    "A rugged butte forms the southern edge of the pass.   Below it, a concave bowl sweeps down towards the tree line, its curved depression filled with snow.  Wandering through the forest beyond, a twisting trail can be seen leisurely making its way down the mountain.  To the east and west, tall peaks cradle the pass."
