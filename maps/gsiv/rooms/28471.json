    "Separated from the main room of the tent by a curtain of glaes-beaded strands, this small nook is filled with bolts of cloth and baskets of thread.  Various patterns, needles, and scissors cover the surface of a large worktable.  Several small benches are placed about a thick wool carpet covering the ground."
