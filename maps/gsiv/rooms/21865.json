  "description": [
    "Natural pine encloses this compact space, from vaulted ceiling to rough polished floor.  A row of paned windows, set above a long brushed steel counter, makes up the full length of one wall.  Opposite the counter stands a small table, with two benches placed on either side affording a comfortable place to sit.  A narrow red door, flanked by a pair of tall cubbyholes, leads back to the world outside, while a golden oak arch on the other side of the room beckons customers to a small alcove in the back."
