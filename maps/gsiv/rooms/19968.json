    "The expanse of green marble floor is interrupted by a long glass-fronted cabinet with several shelves that stands against one pale, cream colored wall.  A velvet-lined display case rests on the opposite wall, its contents glittering in the light of several ensconced candles that dot the room.  In the southeastern corner, a gnarled ebonwood arch offers a limited view of darkness from the next room, while on the southwestern corner a carved modwir door resides beside a large gold-framed painting."
