    "A thick layer of muddied sawdust covers the area of this small run-down wagon.  A single open-faced glass case case has been pushed up against the far wall.  Below the glass case are shards of glass in all shapes and sizes that glitter just barely in the torch light.  Two single torches, one on either side of the doorway, are the only light provided."
