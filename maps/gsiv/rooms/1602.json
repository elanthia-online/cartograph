    "The color of paving shifts to a pale gold as the terra cotta bricks are replaced by small blocks of white granite.  South of the avenue the view is blocked by a high, white granite wall, although a stonework structure is just visible beyond it.  A large wooden gate, painted with a golden crown atop a circle of white, fills the gateway in the center of the wall.  A sign hangs below the symbol.",
    "The color of paving stones shifts to pale gold as terra cotta bricks segue gently into small blocks of white granite.  North of the avenue, the view is obscured by a high stone wall, although a towering golden fane rises into the skyline beyond it.  Twin columns of shining white stone split the wall, supporting an arc carved with a crown in detailed bas-relief.  Floral scents sugar the air, emanating from a gold-flecked white marble building across the way.",
