  "description": [
    "Torches with unnatural blue flames line the crumbling walls of the mausoleum, lending the plundered vaults a cold and lonesome air.  Nothing of value remains, and even the wooden floorboards have given up resistence, having shattered long ago under the weight of a vault lid to expose a tunnel leading further into the tomb."
