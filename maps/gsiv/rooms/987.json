    "The trail switches back and forth across this squat hill that separates the DragonSpine Mountains from Zhindel's Post.  Aside from where travelers have passed, the snow is an unbroken white field.  There is one place, though, where the snow seems to be badly disturbed.  Directly upslope several trails have been plowed straight down through the powdery accumulation.  Nothing could have made such a trail moving uphill, so whatever made them must have come downhill...fast."
