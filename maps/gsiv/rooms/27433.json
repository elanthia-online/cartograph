    "A skeletal bare-limbed tree looms over a towering glass-walled fish tank filled with murky water, its thin bone-like branches rattling against the sides of the tank whenever the wind gusts.  Several feet away, a bug-eyed scaly gnomish boy stands next to a crude line drawn into the dirt with a metal bucket of slimy eyeballs sitting at his feet.  The pungent scent of fish, some fresh and some past their prime, permeates the area."
