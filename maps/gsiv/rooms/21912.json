    "The walls of the small silk tent have been decorated with strands of tiny silver bells, tinkling merrily with every errant breeze.  Hanging from wooden posts are glass-paneled lanterns that drench the area with plenty of yellow light.  A large rawhide pack hangs open from a wooden rack, and is surrounded by a number of old oak chests."
