    "A lone tanik tree, stunted and gnarled by age and weather, stands in stark contrast to the cloud-dotted moonlit sky.  The tree is surrounded by a patch of low blue-green juniper shrubs.  The chilly breeze makes the junipers rustle.  An ancient wooden shield has been jammed into the prickly shrubs.",
