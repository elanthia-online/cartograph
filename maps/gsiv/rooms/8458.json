    "Thorns and brambles line the path, tearing at the clothing of all who pass.  To the southwest the trail opens into the rugged, rocky terrain of the Sentoph mountains, while to the northeast it widens into the barren landscape around the tower.  Loose stones tumble onto the path, dislodged from the jagged boulders that rise to either side."
