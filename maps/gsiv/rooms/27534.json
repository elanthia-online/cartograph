  "description": [
    "At the base of the slope, a moat-like trench encircles this claustrophobic chamber to collect the rivulets of watery sand that flow ever-downward from the head of the incline.  The stone floor at the center rises above the dregs, and it has been carved with a sigil composed of sinuous, coiling lines and a variety of indistinct symbols.  Concave niches chiseled out of the walls hold glowing violet orbs that shed modest light, but no heat throughout the space, and a narrow ward-carved crevice mars the rear wall."
