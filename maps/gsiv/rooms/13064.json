  "description": [
    "As the trail climbs higher, the modwirs are left far behind, exposing a windswept escarpment.  Though one might expect a path traversing its face to be steep and treacherous, great care has been taken in keeping the route even and the incline gradual.  Scattered detritus indicates that rockfalls are common, yet the path is clear of debris.  Large rocks, all of the same approximate size, are spaced evenly along the outer rim to prevent erosion or, perhaps, to prevent travelers from a dangerous misstep."
