    "Rubble from a ruined alabaster statue lies scattered among the stunted weeds which grow between the cracks of the cobblestones.  The base of the statue remains relatively intact, but the upper third has been reduced to fist-sized chunks of alabaster.  Cracks appear in the wall surrounding the courtyard."
