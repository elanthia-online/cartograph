    "Framed in dark iron, tumbled-smooth stones and pastel seaglass set in enamel form the mosaic table top, the layer of enamel trapped beneath a surface of rippled glass.  A tulip-shaped candle holder sits at the center, with an indigo tea candle flickering brightly within.  From time to time, a subtle breeze stirs the air, carrying with it breaths faint with honeysuckle."
