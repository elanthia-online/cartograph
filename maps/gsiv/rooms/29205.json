  "description": [
    "With a steep passageway being the one way in or out, there is a sharp drop-off into this multitiered room of blackish grey rock.  Channels eroded into the surface of the bedrock have formed plateaus, both high and low.  Numerous flat outcroppings hold small coconut crab shells, upturned and filled with burning oil, to lend light, warmth, and a pleasant fragrance to the imposing space.  Stalwart granite formations give cover for either safety or for ambush, to predator and prey alike."
