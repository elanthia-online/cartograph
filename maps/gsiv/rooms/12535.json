    "A fine-grained wood counter separates the ordering area from the display and kitchen area.  A layer of flour seems to cover the entire kitchen except for the display and counter, which are meticulously clean.  A marble cutting board stands ready for use next to the display case, while pots of steaming coffee resting on grates above a wood fire flank the other side.  Large canvas bags of coffee beans slump against walls behind the counter."
