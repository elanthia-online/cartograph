    "The trail twists and turns, winding around tropical vegetation that grows with lush abandon.  Flowers cluster about the feet of palms and bloom from vines climbing the trees' trunks, with leaves so large, they could shelter a person from a heavy downpour.  The narrow track dwindles toward the south, where the verdure becomes thicker and the flowers more extravagant."
