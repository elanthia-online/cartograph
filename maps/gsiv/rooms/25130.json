  "description": [
    "A carved steel door leads to the east wing of the castle.  The walls of this wing are painted a pristine ivory with decorative golden scrollwork gracing the top edges.  A row of wrought bronze candelabras burn with an ethereal light, their heatless flicker casting shadows on the walls.  Tiles of alternating exotic metals line the patterned floor of the entryway."
