    "Smooth grey stone walls have had numerous niches and shelves carved out of their very rock, creating natural display areas for the wares in this giftshop.  A variety of glassware and other novelty items are neatly arranged on the available space.  Behind an immaculate speckled marble counter is a cheery dwarven clerk ready to assist customers."
