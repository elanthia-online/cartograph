    "Clothing of every size, shape, color and fabric festoons the long, wide room.  Heaps of cloth are piled beside worktables and benches, and garments overflow the trunks and racks used to store them.  Cabinets and chests of drawers line the walls and bright lanterns of myriad shapes and sizes dangle from the ceiling to contribute to the room's brilliant illumination.  A narrow staircase in the west wall is partially obscured by a spill of costumes, but the doorway in the east wall remains clear."
