    "Resembling an hourglass laid on its side, this chamber appears to have been naturally formed, but then embellished and made functional by dwarven design and labor.  The choke-point in the center of the cavern is now almost entirely filled by a steel-topped counter and display case, while beyond it, hammerfalls echo from a dozen or so tunnels that pierce the curved wall of the chamber.  A dwarven attendant stands behind the counter, patiently waiting to provide whatever assistance might be needed."
