    "Silver moonlight flows into the room.  A large dome of clear crystal encompasses the room, keeping the chill night air at bay while providing a view of the inky night sky.  The forest below is lit by the moons above and the occasional spark of a firefly.  A small lamp rests near the ladder, and pillows are scattered about for relaxing stargazing."
