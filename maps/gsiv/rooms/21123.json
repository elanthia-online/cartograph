    "Layers of palm fronds litter the uneven stone floor of the room, the thick fanned leaves muffling the sounds of the thatched temple from the world beyond.  A haphazard path of candles and incense, held within vessels of broken glass and shell, lead to an altar of greyed marble, its smooth unaltered surface a stark contrast to a weathered driftwood figure standing upon it.  Encircling the feet of the statue are several trinkets, some newly offered, while others have succumbed to the effects of the sea air.  An arch set into one wall leads out."
