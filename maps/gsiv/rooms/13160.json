    "Solid walls hewn from subterranean rock enclose the arena, ensuring anything within its confines stays inside.  Notably, a massive iron gate stands before a large granite block archway, the only way in to the stone edifice from this portion of the cavern.  Deep hollows have been created in certain sections of the perimeter, and within their shadows, the savage eyes of monsters seek escape from their prisons."
