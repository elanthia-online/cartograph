    "The broad sweep of the ebonwood floor is interrupted by a sphere-topped black marble fountain.  Halfway to the arched ceiling, a noble elf maiden portrait hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls.  A silk-covered dress mannequin and an intricately carved ebonwood stand are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
