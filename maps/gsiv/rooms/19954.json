    "Ivory-hued walls frame this portion of the long hallway that comprises this wing of the museum.  Hanging on one wall is a reversed white eonake greatshield, a landscape scene covering its concave surface.  Flanking the shield are two oak-framed paintings interspersed with ensconced oil lanterns that light up the room.  On the opposite wall, a leaf-etched rosewood-framed painting hangs beside a long teak-framed portrait.  Beneath the artwork, some short cast bronze otter statues and their accompanying sign rest on the pale mottled-green marble floor."
