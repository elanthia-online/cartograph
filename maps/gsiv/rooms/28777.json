  "description": [
    "A tartan carpet with braided trim runs the length of the hallway, muffling footsteps on the polished pine floor.  Faenor sconces punched with a pattern of tiny snowflakes are affixed to the wall on either side of a glass-paned stained pine door.  The hallway is redolent with smells of pungent, herbal smoke that seem to be coming from the parlour just beyond the doorway."
