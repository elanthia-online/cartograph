    "Weeds striving to grow between the gravel, and the thorn bushes and milk-white trumpet shrubs obscuring the foundation of the crypt provide the only clues that life goes on amid the desolation.  Wisps of tattered cloth and stray tufts of fur are caught upon the thorns.  Several intact gravesites lie to the east."
