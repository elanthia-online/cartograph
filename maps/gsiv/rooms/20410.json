    "Placed in each corner of the canopied area, three mannequins stand as sentinels, their muted garb elegant, yet demure.  A pair of ebon silk partitions creates a circular dressing space centered with the tall oak pole holding the cotton roof in place.  A large ebonwood mirror rests near the entrance, several lengths of material wrapped around the stand."
