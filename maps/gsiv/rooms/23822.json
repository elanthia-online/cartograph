    "The utilitarian interior of the wagon could generously be described as spartan.  Not a single sign of inhabitation graces the area.  An engraved bow rack, a carved runestaff display, and a large weapon stand are the only furniture within the bare confines.  An oil lamp rests in the middle of the floor, illuminating its sparse surroundings."
