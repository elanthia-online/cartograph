    "Crawling over the rocks, you find yourself in yet another chamber.  This one is smaller, with its corners cloaked in shadow.  Looking up elicits a gasp of surprise...cave paintings!  Roltons, velnalins, horses and wolves race across walls and ceilings in wild profusion.  Some are simply outlined in black while others are filled in with bright earth colors, but all show the same uncanny sense of life.  This is obviously not the work of goblins!"
