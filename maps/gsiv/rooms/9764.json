    "The catwalk encircling the lofty chamber seems dangerous, suspended on very thin wire supports attached to the transparent bubble overhead.  At the sphere's center, a colossal machine dominates everything, its gears, arms and pulleys so numerous, no self-evident logic can be determined by looking at them.  A flight of tenuous stairs, likewise suspended on thin wires, leads up to a higher vantage point."
