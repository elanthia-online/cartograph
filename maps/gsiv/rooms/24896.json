    "Lush, dark green moss covers the floor, and thick vines lash split logs together to form the ceiling and walls.  A wind chime crafted from twigs, seashells, and bits of twine hangs in the open doorway.  Tucked into one corner is a triangular shelf with a woven banana leaf basket swinging below it."
