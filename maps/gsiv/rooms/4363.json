    "Mid-chest stacks of unopened storage boxes line the far walls of this cave.  The flickering candlelight from a few sporadically placed candles reflects from glittering ore within the walls, giving the illusion of starlight.  Closest to the entrance, a large wooden strongbox and a heavy steel chest have been left open.  A small iron box and a massive mithril strongbox have been placed close together in the center of the floor.  A few items have also been tossed on top of an unopened storage box."
