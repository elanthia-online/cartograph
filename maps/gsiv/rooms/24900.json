    "A wooden signpost, topped with a carved monir owl and leaning to one side, marks the transition of a narrow footpath to a rutted, dirt lane dotted with small houses and buildings on the north side.  In one yard, overgrown, prickly bushes flank the entrance to a thatched-roof shop constructed of dark grey stone.  An empty cart with a broken wheel is parked next to a deserted roadside stand."
