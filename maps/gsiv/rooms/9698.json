    "The trail skirts the base of a large growth of scrub trees and arrives at the foot of a sheer wall composed of stone.  The boulders are symmetrical and skillfully positioned, betraying the fact that this edifice was built by other forces than nature.  The wall rises for close to thirty spans.  At its summit, the upper reaches of a second and third tier of rectangular sections can be glimpsed.  All around the monument, thick boughs robed with black foliage all but conceal the ziggurat's location."
