    "The wall curves inward in the direction of the structured section of the barbican ahead.  Assorted iron spikes are affixed along the inner wall, each sharpened to a vicious point.  Growing over the wall, vibrant green vines with small, budding flowers shake slightly when the wind gusts outside."
