    "Odd outcroppings of rock and calcium deposits angle sharply downward from ceiling to floor in this part of the cavern, creating the illusion of a giant mouth poised to crunch down on some tasty morsel.  To the northeast there is a break in the stalagmite formation that dominates the center of the chamber."
