    "Two bunk beds reside in opposing corners, their mattresses thin and hard.  A tiny round table stands in the center, the unwashed tin plate and utensils resting upon it already attracting the interest of flies.  A large weapons rack leans against the north wall, with a matching armor stand taking a position along the southern wall."
