    "A dark, brackish, slow-moving stream emerges from under some thick, dangerous-looking brambles and meanders off to the northeast.  Several stones, strategically placed, allow dry passage across the stream to the heavily shaded, moss-choked path running northwest and southwest.  Swarming insects, spawned from the standing pools, add a buzzing, biting layer of black fog to the already misty atmosphere."
