    "Massive walls of vegetation edge the clearing, emphasizing the open, almost barren, nature of the area.  Delicate blossoms, closed tightly beneath the pale rays of moonlight, spread like a patchwork quilt across the ground.  Large boulders rise from the glittering sea, reflecting the soft glow emitted by thousands of fireflies dancing along perfumed breezes."
