  "description": [
    "Standing beneath the ominous shadow of a barely-standing watchtower, the outpost is a small expanse of crumbling buildings surrounded by a broken stone wall.  The sole identifying mark of the former occupants is a ragged banner, faded by the sun, clinging like a hungry banshee to the ravaged remains of a small shop.  Flagstones peek up from beneath the sand here and there, but the Sea's inexorable will has already drowned them and many other signs of human habitation."
