    "[Bard Guild, Winding Stairwell]"

  "description": [
    "The curving stairwell widens at the foot of a window, its view partially obstructed by heavily carved wooden screens.  Beyond the screens lies a panoramic vista of quaint rooftops and minarets, and in the distance, the sparkle of moonlight on water.  An arched doorway is discretely set in a small alcove produced by the stairway's turn, and from inside, the clink of glass and delicious aromas extend an invitation to come within."
