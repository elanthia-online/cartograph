    "Large mushrooms cover the ground in a miniature forest, as if mimicking the pine trees above them.  Their skin is soft and spongy, covered in a thin layer of clear slime created by the low fog.  Several have been toppled by the careless movements of someone or something, exposing the fluted surface beneath the cap."
