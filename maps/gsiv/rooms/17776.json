    "This vast gallery has been arduously excavated from solid granite.  Gigantic stalactites and stalagmites have been enhanced with granite blocks to form massive pillars that uphold the cavern's roof.  Fissures in the ceiling provide pathways for the arctic winds to ventilate the cavern, but the crystalline deposits in the stone surfaces seem to echo the warmth and light, keeping the temperature comfortable."
