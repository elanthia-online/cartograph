    "A leafy border of slender ash trees prevents a clear view of the slow-moving river beyond, but the thick scent of river water and a gentle, lapping rhythm attest to its proximity.  A few corrugated marble columns have been artfully placed amid the narrow line of trees, their stark, white surfaces ensnared by local creepers."
