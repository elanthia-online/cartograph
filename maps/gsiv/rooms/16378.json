    "The rough sandstone walls of the room are alive with an array of various objects and artifacts strewn from nails and lined up along pine shelves.  Sets of brightly-woven tapestries and wind-blown flags hang haphazardly from the ceiling, each displaying an ornate image.  An old fisherman's net has been thrown across a tall bamboo counter, exposing an assortment of stuffed fish and dried sea creatures for purchase."
