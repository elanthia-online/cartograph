    "A contoured counter of polished black oak curves along one side of the room, its high sheen reflecting light from a pair of glowing crystalline orbs which flank it.  Behind the counter, a wall-mounted shelf contains a complex of honeycombed cubicles.  A shallow niche on one wall contains the miniature carving of a leafless tree, the ends of its gnarled branches tipped with tiny luminous nodules."
