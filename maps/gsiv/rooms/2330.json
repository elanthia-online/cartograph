    "A small red schoolhouse brightens the area, the pealing of the bell filling your ears.  An old halfling schoolmistress stands at the door, calling the children in from play.  The air is brisk, made chilly by the glacier to the north, and the flowers in the schoolyard are small and hearty.",
    "A small red schoolhouse is illuminated by moonlight, its bell silently waiting to call the children in from play.  The air is brisk, made chilly by the glacier to the north, and the flowers in the schoolyard are small and hearty."
