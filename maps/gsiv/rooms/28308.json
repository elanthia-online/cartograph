    "A narrow stone staircase winds its way up the side of the tower into this small, domed observatory.  The room is dominated by a vaalorn and coraesine telescope poised at the center, its polished fittings gleaming brightly in the sunlight coming through a slit overhead.  To one side, a large wooden crank is connected to some complicated rope-and-pully contraption."
