  "description": [
    "Witch-balls, suspended from the ceiling by bits of twine, dangle at varying lengths, their candle-lit bodies spilling a golden glow upon the refurbished floorboards.  Recesses carved into the granite walls display a variety of wares under the watchful eye of a young giantwoman.  Near the back of the shop, a coin-edged velvet curtain provides entry to a backroom."
