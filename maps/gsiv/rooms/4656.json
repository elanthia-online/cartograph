    "Moonlight glints on broken shards of glass littering the ground around a ramshackle cabin that is surrounded by rank weeds.  Bursting through the floor and roof of the cabin is a twisted tree.  Barely hanging on its last remaining hinge, a huge rusted lock is the only thing that is keeping the door from falling to the ground.  Not far off, on a scorched piece of land, the bare trees beyond the shed look like fingers stripped to the bone.",
