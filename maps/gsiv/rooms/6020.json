    "Thick, tall weeds cover the ground on this side of the barn, making passage difficult.  The weeds spread out down an embankment to the east, and it is apparent that the soil is poor and useless for farming.  Wide rain gullies cut through the embankment, exposing rocks and stones.  The barn's east wall rises to a height of approximately twelve feet.  Its expanse is flat and unmarred except for a long wooden door set in the northern end."
