    "Reinforced walls crafted from hardened steel and coated in bright gold expand the interior of this vault.  Flickering candles reflect light off the war chests overflowing with silver and gems and onto several portraits displayed in the rear.  An antique bookcase extends along the western wall adjacent a thick glass case with an intricate lock displaying artifacts.  A vintage oak wine cabinet with an assortment of liquors is perfectly displayed for all to see."
