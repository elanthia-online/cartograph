    "The modwir-paneled walls outfitting the spacious storage area are polished to a faint silvery gleam and house a brass-faced porthole that provides a glimpse of the water outside.  Incandescent oil lamps hanging along the bulkheads illuminate a pair of vivid cyan seascape tapestries that frame the sides of a beaded sewing room curtain and provide plenty of light to inspect a neatly labeled sewing pattern cabinet."
