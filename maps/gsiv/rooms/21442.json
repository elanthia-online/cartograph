    "Shades of black, white, and grey dominate the modest wagon, giving it a tastefully elegant achromatic scheme, from the tall fel walls to the pallid marble flooring.  A pale ivory cedar bureau is paired with contrasting carved ebony shelves, mirroring an identical arrangement between an onyx-hued walnut chest and a niveous mistwood cabinet.  As an inviting touch, a lush spray of slender alabaster calla lilies in a crystalline vase is displayed on a glass-topped case at the front of the room."
