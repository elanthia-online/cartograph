    "What once was a cabin has been turned on its side nearly upside down, making the room awkward and a bit disorienting.  Despite the odd angles, a nearby sidebar appears to be well stocked.  Dim light seeps through uneven cracks from both the underside of the fishing barge and the uneven planks that once made up its deck."
