    "A broad oak counter has been set opposite the shop's heavy door.  Its surface is stacked with twine-tied ledgers and a scattering of dry straw, probably pulled from the many crates and boxes stacked around the display cases in the room.  A small note has been pinned to the front of the counter, at dwarven eye-level."
