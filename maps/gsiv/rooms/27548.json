    "Tendrils of creeper vines dangle from above, their trailing ends dangling moss amid their heart-shaped leaves.  Shadows and darkness play across the twisting path as it meanders upward and downward around rotted stumps overgrown with liana vines that are painted an odd indigo hue with silver veining.  With rotted roots exposed to the air, an enormous barnacle-covered tree lies upon the ground, a captive of strangler figs."
