    "Mud-filled paths that might conceivably be called roads wander off in many directions, through a veritable maze of run-down shacks, fences and puddles.  An ancient, corroded brass figure of a mermaid lies half-buried in the muck, as if salvaged from some ship lost on the riverbank many years ago and set here to guard the neighborhood."
