    "Resembling an hourglass laid on its side, this chamber appears to have been naturally formed, then embellished and made functional by dwarven design and labor.  The choke-point in the center of the cavern is almost entirely filled by a steel-topped counter and display case, and beyond it, hammerfalls echo from a dozen or so tunnels that pierce the curving walls.  A dwarven attendant stands behind the counter, patiently waiting to provide whatever assistance might be needed."
