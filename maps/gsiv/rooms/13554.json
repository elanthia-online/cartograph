    "The broad sweep of the dark oak floor is interrupted by a carved ivory lighthouse.  Halfway to the pine rafter ceiling, a iron-hooked split oak oar hangs on one of the knotty oak-paneled walls.  A staved-in treasure chest and a steel-banded maoral rack are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
