  "description": [
    "Purple weeds, which stand tall and sturdy about knee-high to a giantman, blanket the ground.  Swirls of deep green, lance-shaped and serrated leaves, about a foot long themselves, cover thick but hollow purple stems.  Rosy pink, purple and white circular clusters of flowers top the stems.  The purple and cream-colored roots are woody with rough hair-like projections."
