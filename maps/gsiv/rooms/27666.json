    "Unnaturally dark, this northernmost part of the rotunda has a strange, empty essence, as if the flows of mana and magic are inhibited and do not reach here.  At eye level, the dome here has been divided into four large panes of clear glass separated by thin steel squares, distinctly setting them apart from the otherwise frosted material of the structure.  An array of telescopes stands near the dome, each pointed at a different pane."
