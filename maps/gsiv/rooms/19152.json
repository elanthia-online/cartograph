    "The corridor opens out into a somewhat larger space that gives you room to turn around a bit and stretch, albeit carefully.  The ever-present crates and boxes litter the room's walls and corners.  To one side a space has been cleared, and a sturdy modwir table and a black lacquered arms rack have been set up with a few surly halfling clerks lounging around to help potential customers."
