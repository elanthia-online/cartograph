    "As you look around the darkened room, you're presented with a scene straight out of a massacre; you see complete chaos and disarray with rusty-looking splatters that cover every available surface.  As your eyes adjust to the dim lighting, you can make out a dark liquid pooling into several puddles on the floor.  After a moment you notice the piles of mixing bowls teetering on the main worktable, and your olfactory glands are assaulted with the overpowering scent of chocolate."
