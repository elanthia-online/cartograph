    "All along the fetid moat, the upsweeping form of the keep is oppressive, its shadow from the southwest giving no shade or comfort.  The hideous carvings and eaves that mark the upper floors of the Black Swan are evident above the outer walls.  Gargoyles, scaly things, unnamed fell beasts, all squatting atop tiled, upturned roofs at weird angles."
