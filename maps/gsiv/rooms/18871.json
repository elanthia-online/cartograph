    "Rich, bone-white carpeting serves as a foundation for this luxurious and inviting den.  A grand bookcase dominates the right wall, storing an impressive collection of tomes.  Situated against the left wall are an antique desk and a liquor cabinet.  A lifelike statue of a hooded figure stands in the center of the room, seemingly scrutinizing all who enter the room.  Against the far wall a plush, black leather couch offers respite to weary feet."
