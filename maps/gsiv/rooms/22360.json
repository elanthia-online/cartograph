    "Polished cobblestones of the var glisten as the sunlight strikes their surfaces.  A thanot-beamed enclave stands to one side of the road, its silvery blue stone shimmering in the heat of the day.  To the other side, a tall, stone palisade encircles a secluded compound.  Flowering greenery grows about a crystal lantern that hangs from an ornately carved alabaster post."
