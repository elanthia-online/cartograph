    "A boulder stands comically to one side of the path, looking like a huge nose protruding from a mass of flowering vines.  The scent of the flowers is indeed sweet; no wonder the boulder wanted to smell them.  Here the path splits in several directions.  The path to the north is rougher, while the paths to the south and southeast appear to lead toward easier ground."
