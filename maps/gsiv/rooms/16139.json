    "A high crumbling riverstone wall runs to the edge of the bluff to the north and disappears into the jungle to the south.  Set in the center of the wall is a large stone arch flanked on either side with the remains of rusted metal hinges.  Two dirt ruts cut through the grass from the east, passing directly under the arch to the interior of the cemetery.  Along the length of the wall grow several clusters of lilies."
