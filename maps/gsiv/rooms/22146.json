    "Elegant furnishings litter the room, providing a lavish retreat.  Plush scarlet carpeting lines the space between grey and blued river stone walls interspersed with fel panels and decorated with detailed paintings.  Lighting the salon, small crystal chandeliers are decked with scarlet despanal accents, and lofty bookshelves are filled with tomes, scrolls, and aged fine wines, rums, and brandies.  Arranged around a pale blue stained glass table are two cocoa-hued divans."
