    "The distant sound of crashing waves filters in on the cool night breeze present near the lagoon edge.  Several tall trees provide a backdrop to the shadowed foliage that spreads out from the shore, creating a thick canopy of leaves that sway with the breeze and break the moonlight into variegated shafts of pallid light."
