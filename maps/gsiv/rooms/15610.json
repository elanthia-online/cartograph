    "The white marble tile is partially obscured by a round carmine rug, its curves matching the interior of the room and the slightly domed ceiling above.  A circle of ivory doors surround the area, each traced with a different trailing pattern of ebony.  A pair of stained glass doors leads out to a quaint balcony, their panes spilling a soft carmine light from beyond the threshold."
