    "A clearing opens unexpectedly among the columns of stone.  The strange double-layer of fog still obscures floor and ceiling, but you begin to get a sense of how truly large this cavern is.  In the open space, the charred remnants of a fire mar the stone floor beneath the mist.  It's impossible to say whether this was some battle, a camp, or perhaps a religious rite."
