    "Though several feet below the main cellar, this sub-cellar has somehow managed to escape the flooding.  Dark and musty, this small, windowless room is disconcertingly tomblike.  A single oil lamp, atop a large battered desk, provides a meager light source.  Absent any air currents, the twin scents of sulfur and smoke linger."
