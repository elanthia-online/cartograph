    "Flooding the intersection with the light streaming from its windows as well as the aroma of baked goods from its door, a modest-sized building stands on the northwest corner.  Customers enter in ones and twos and leave with cookies, muffins and small loaves in hand.",
    "A modest-sized building stained a pale yellow with dark blue trim around the windows and powder blue awnings sits on the northwest corner, the mouthwatering aroma of fresh baked goods wafting from its open door.  A pair of pushcart vendors are loading up with golden brown loaves just outside, their efforts constantly impeded by the flow of customers in and out of the entrance.",
