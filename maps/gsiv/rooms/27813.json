    "A massive teak desk occupies the center of an oval office, surrounded by tall book shelves filled with leather-bound volumes.  Beneath the desk, a rug covers much of the floor framed by dark slate tiles around its perimeter.  The rug features a pattern of musical notation running around its edges.  Windows punctuate the spaces between the shelves, opening to a view of the Bay in the distance."
