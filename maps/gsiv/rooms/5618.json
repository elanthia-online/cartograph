    "Twisted, gnarled trees fill the swamp with shapes that trick the eye, giving the illusion of a host of creatures standing nearby, peering at the path through the vines and bushes of the swamp.  Large blue flies and dragonflies buzz from plant to plant, crossing the path in a flurry of activity."
