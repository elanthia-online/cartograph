  "description": [
    "Many gravemarkers, some of stone and some of ancient broken wood, have been set into the higher ground here where the land slopes up out of the mire into a rise along the creek bank to the west.  A flicker of white in the mist draws attention to an ancient skull, dangling from a high branch of a moss-covered yew and swinging with an eternal haunting motion in the undulating currents of fog."
