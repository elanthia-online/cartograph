    "Smooth riverstones of several colors cobble a wide pathway within a well-kept forest.  Tall modwirs are spaced far enough apart for their shorter cousins to receive blessed sunlight.  The forest floor shows no sign of debris left from previous seasons, its rich loam scent mixing with the bouquet of well-tended wildflowers lining the path.",
    "Smooth riverstones, their various tones muted in the starlight, cobble a wide pathway within a well-kept forest.  Tall modwirs are spaced far enough apart for their shorter cousins to thrive.  The forest floor shows no sign of debris left from previous seasons, its rich loam scent mixing with the bouquet of well-tended wildflowers lining the path."
