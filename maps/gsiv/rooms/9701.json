    "The leafy canopy overhead lowers, making the path resemble a rabbit warren more so than a trail.  Huge cinnamon ferns on either side almost obscure its progress, punctuated by boulders encroaching at regular intervals.  Ropy vines dangle from the branches overhead, their loops festooned with leaves and tendrils."
