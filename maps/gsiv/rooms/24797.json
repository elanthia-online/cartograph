  "description": [
    "Nestled among the boughs of the ancient rosewood and extending out over the alcove below, this circular platform serves as a quiet workroom removed from common distractions.  A sturdy railing with a deep ledge, wound through with climbing vines heavy with fragrant flowers, surrounds the space, a small gap where a simple rope ladder hangs down the only break in the protection it affords.  Thin, woven grass mats line the plank floor, and a large dip in a branch stretching out from the tree's trunk forms a passably comfortable seat."
