  "description": [
    "Coppery beech trees and bough-spreading white oaks block out nearly all moonlight, making an eery landscape of shadow upon darkness cut with blades of silver.  Barely visible, a crooked path winds around the trunks in a north-south direction, while a narrow ravine leads down to an old creekbed.",
    "Coppery beech trees bearing patches of lush moss, thriving parasitically on the rough grey bark, grow in small groups apart from the taller, bough-spreading white oaks.  Some of the dark green foliage bear spiny orange-red pods, hedgehog galls, temporary home for young wasps.  A crooked path winds around the trunks in a north-south direction, while a narrow ravine leads down to an old creekbed."
