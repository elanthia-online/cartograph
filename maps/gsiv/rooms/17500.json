    "Overturned, small wooden tubs are positioned alongside chairs encircling a long sideboard that has the hilt of a dagger deeply embedded within its surface.  Along the back wall, a dart board hangs above a warped cask.  Placed in the middle of a slightly battered pedestal is a leather-bound black book."
