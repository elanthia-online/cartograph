    "The room, curved back upon itself like a short oval, is nearly claustrophobic.  Into each curved wall has been carved several niches.  From these perches look the Lords and Ladies of Lornon, peering down on all those who have come to pray.  The room is devoid of pillow or bench, leaving nothing but the floor to sit or kneel on."
