    "A glaesine-topped cyprus workbench dominates the cramped laboratory, one end pushed against the wall so it is beneath a nonagonal window.  Atop the window-side of the workbench rests a complicated, bronze gem lens assembly.  A glass alembic and a rune-carved, cobalt blue marble crucible also congregate upon the workbench.  Scorch marks mar the white marble floors, and a curtained arch leads northwest to the main hallway.  A potted foxglove resides in the lone, unscorched corner, bathed in moonlight.",
