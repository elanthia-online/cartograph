    "Serving as the sole source of illumination, moonlight streams in from a small open window, dust particles swirling through the brilliant rays.  A massive, moss-covered cypress tree with low hanging branches and deep hollows has burst through the uneven flooring damaged by a continuous assault of moisture from the surrounding swamp.  Two costumed goblins move hurriedly through the room, straightening the assembled costumes and replacing the dwindling inventory."
