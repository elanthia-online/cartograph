    "Two faceted crystal spheres hang in mid air, to either side of a set of intricately carved haon double doors, casting an eerie yellow light across the passage.  Shadows dance around the rough grey carpeting before leaping onto the wall and taking rest upon the ceiling as the light chases them around the room.  The faint smell of sulphur and rose petals drifts through the air."
