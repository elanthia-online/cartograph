  "description": [
    "A ring of corpses lays splayed across the ground, encircling a clear patch of rough rock as if they had been arranged there.  They are bathed in a source of bile green light that seethes from the south, where the low roof of the tunnel rises precipitously.  A spent lantern sits next to one of the bodies, its metal hood bent and its glass spiderwebbed with cracks."
