    "Despite a hard-packed dirt floor and a heavy haze of tobacco smoke hanging in the air, this tavern sports a cheery decor.  Brightly painted posts hold up a thatched grass roof and checkered cloths and candles decorate several tables tucked beneath the eaves.  A well-stocked bar is flanked with an assortment of barstools.",

Brightly painted posts hold up a splintered timber roof and checkered cloths and candles decorate several tables tucked beneath the eaves.  Dim lighting emits from beyond the far side of the room."
