    "A small, open-air pavilion stands near the center of a clearing in a grove of fragrant persimmon trees.  Tall columns of green riverstone are topped with a dome painted deep blue.  Ivy grows profusely in the narrow spaces between the columns, creating a leafy wall that conceals the interior of the pavilion.  Moonlight glints off something metallic behind the ivy.",
