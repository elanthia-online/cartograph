    "The former office of the ice quarry stands slightly apart from the rest of the buildings.  Blackened timber and a caved-in roof are all that remains of the burned-out hulk, a silent reminder to the former quarryhands.  Thick walls of ice hold up the wood, the water used to douse the flames having become a solid reminder of the fierce weather that rips through the area."
