  "description": [
    "Light blonde ash parquet flooring warmly reflects the ambient light in this immense room.  Vaulted arches soar overhead, creating a vast open space that is accentuated by a brightly burning, elaborate vaalin chandelier hanging from the domed glass ceiling.  Dark cherrywood wainscoting separates the rich cream and forest green wallpaper from the ivory marble walls above.  A small side table sits along the west wall, while a sweeping staircase leading up to the living quarters dominates the eastern wall."
