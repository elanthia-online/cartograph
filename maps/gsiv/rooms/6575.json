    "A strange, flickering blue aurora illuminates this room.  It has no direct source, but seems to be brightest around a monstrous bone chair, the color of old teeth.  The thing is as big as a throne and its surface is polished to a soft gleam.  Facing the chair is a grisly row of pikes, each one bearing a shriveled, mummified head."
