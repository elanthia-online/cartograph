  "description": [
    "Steeped in the pale glow of wisps of light clustering around several low-hanging drapery stalactites, the broad space is peppered with long rows of small dog-tooth stalagmites that pop up from the ground.  The maw-like divisions span between the edge of the cavern and a huge wooden palisade wall.  Settled near the palisade is an unnaturally flat boulder partially encircled by a trio of red velvet couches.  Riddled with the scent of death and decay, the air is crisp and cool."
