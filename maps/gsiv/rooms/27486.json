    "Bright yellow and cobalt blue canvas sails are draped across each other to create a light protective awning over the small oak-sided stall.  Thick ropes of hemp secure the ceiling to the walls and even assist in binding various shelves into place using complex lashing knots.  A single oak counter stretches across the entry, while small wooden drawers hang under the shelves.  A wooden sign dangles precariously on the counter's edge."
