  "description": [
    "The floor of the steep hallway is an obstacle course of floor slabs canted up and piles of boulders braced against them.  Overhead, the ceiling is a convoluted barrel vault, its proportions looking off-kilter from the exaggerated twist of the passageway.  The rock walls exhibit an expanse of runic bas-relief, its intricacy and sheer scope an amazing accomplishment.  Stale air hangs in the corridor, thick with dust and the smell of antiquity."
