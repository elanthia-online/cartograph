    "The soft loam of the trail is cushioned by fallen leaves.  The crest of a broad moundlike formation is silhouetted against the sky to the northeast, its slopes carpeted with purple heather and pink-flowering salorisa shrubs.  The ghostly grey visage of a granite crypt haunts the southwest horizon."
