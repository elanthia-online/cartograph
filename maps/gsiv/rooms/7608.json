    "Here, very near the wooden remains of a small fishing pier, you can still make out the stumps of poles used to hang nets out to dry.  This place is level and over time, sand has drifted in to make a deep enough carpet to smooth the rough stones and soften the harshness of bare rock.  Bits of wood and a few rusted nails lie in a pattern that resolves itself into the outline of a small skiff, long since rotted away.  It has been long since anyone came here to fish, since the coming of the Undead."
