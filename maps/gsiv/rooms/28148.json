  "description": [
    "The path stops abruptly at a circle of glowering tall cedars, where seemingly dozens of ravens have made their home.  The ravens caw back and forth at each other in a sort of dialogue, only to stop altogether at unpredictable intervals.  Violent wing flaps punctuate the cacophony, as the ravens take flight across the circle from one perch to another."
