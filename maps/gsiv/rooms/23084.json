    "Dotted with large, flat rocks, the bleak foliage of the swamp opens up into a muddy expanse speckled with large standing pools of stagnant water.  Yellowish-green clumps of bladderwort fill nearly half of the aquatic bays, while the other half houses a thin scum of rainbow-hued slime.  A pervasive dankness lies heavy upon the air and is accompanied by a wretched stench that is a gagging blend of rotting corpses and invasive mold spores."
