    "A rough stone stairway has been carved out of the limestone that leads up from the watery passageway.  A few steps up, mist-laden spiderwebs hang across the stairwell, their creators long gone from this secluded corridor.  The gentle splashing of water can be heard to the west, carried on a warm, salty breeze."
