    "The intimate boutique is papered an intense viridian hue on the walls, posing a striking contrast with the lustrous black fel flooring underfoot.  Delicate silver chimes strung with paper-thin nacreous shells hang above an ornate crystalline carousel holding jewel-colored bottles.  Faceted sea glass sconces diffuse a soft lotus scent in the air, while illuminating a dark-grained maoral wardrobe and a pale thanot bureau nestled in the back corner.",
