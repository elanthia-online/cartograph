    "Poles, ropes, and huge sheets of brightly-colored canvas lie scattered about the dock.  A group of giantmen, wearing sleeveless leather vests and well-worn pants, move about, working industriously to put up the immense tent.  Performers gather to practice among the hustle and bustle, perfecting their acts for an upcoming show."
