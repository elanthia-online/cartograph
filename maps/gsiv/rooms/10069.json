    "Facing the square sits a well-kept building, its walls made of stacked round river rock.  The structure's clay tiled roof glows with a dull red hue, the tiles chipped here and there from years of exposure to the elements.  Flowers spill over the sides of a wooden planter next to the front door, above which hangs a carved wooden sign.",

Golden yellow light is barely visible in the crevice between the front door and its sturdy frame, above which hangs a carved wooden sign."
