    "At the foot of a cliff wall, the trail circles, doubling back on itself and looping around some boulders grouped at the bluff's base.  The rock face is striated, with bands of color that resemble gently waving ribbons.  Over the pattern created by the sediments, a panorama of primitive beasts is painted.  Depicted there are pyrothags, skayl and other animals that are unrecognizable, but elegant in form and posture.",

The rock face is striated, with bands of color that resemble gently waving ribbons.  Over the pattern created by the sediments, a panorama of primitive beasts is painted, rendered in beautiful earth tones that complement the colors of the rock.
