    "Cold inhabits the chamber as if it were bred here.  Across the floor, debris and dust mark uninhabited time as well as a clock, sifting into the room's corners in gentle drifts.  The odor of decay hangs over the emptiness with its secretive nuances, speaking a subtle language universal to all lands."
