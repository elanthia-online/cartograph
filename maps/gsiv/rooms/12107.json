    "An immense moon the color of drying blood dominates the sky.  It sheds ruddy crimson light over the broken world, seeming to swallow every other color in its red glow.  Horrible beasts crawl over the ground, looking like giant lobsters which raise their claws in tribute to the lunar glow, while man-wolves raise their eerie voices in a primal tribute."
