    "The small space is surrounded by the wooden plank walls of the wagon and taken up by several surfaces that display wares for sale.  A solid oak counter resides near the entry door, while a set of oak shelves sits beside a curtain that leads further into the shop.  Hanging on the walls are some assorted signs with bold writing, and between them a tall cabinet rests against the wall near a pair of flickering torches."
