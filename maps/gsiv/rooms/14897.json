    "Frost-covered trees greet visitors to the garden, each of their leaves lightly dusted with a glittering layer of snow.  Fragile icicles dangle from the branches, many long enough to reach the ground.  A lone wooden bench faces the tallest of the trees and looks to be an ideal spot for contemplation."
