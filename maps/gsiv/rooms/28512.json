    "[A Hidden Chamber, Nexus]"

  "description": [
    "A stone pillar stands in the center of this chamber and is accessable only by a raised stone walkway that stretches over a series of concentric channels carved into the floor around it.  The channels are brimming with water, fed from an unseen source, and their surfaces roil constantly but softly, filling the area with a lulling whisper of the movement.  Several oil lamps mounted along the curve of the back wall offer fitful illumination to the narrow opening that leads deeper into the rocky surroundings."
