    "Dozens of globe-shaped flower buds, huge in size, are nestled within the field of artichoke plants to one side of the dusty path.  The artichokes are a grey-green color, and the petals of the bud are still wrapped tightly around the heads.  A narrow path leads into the heart of many rows of the same plants, while the main path you are on continues along the edges of the fields."
