  "description": [
    "This carefully designed chamber's acoustics make it perfect for singing, the high ceiling magnifying sound without disortion.  Straight-backed chairs next to sturdy, slanted music stands provide a place for the musicians to practice and perform.  A scattering of students work at composing stories, reciting poems or simply daydreaming -- all vital components of the bardic arts."
