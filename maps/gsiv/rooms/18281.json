    "Monoliths of leaf and bark shelter the few saplings lucky enough to exploit rare patches of moonlight speckling the otherwise dim area.  Tucked in the maze of tree branches, a family of golden lion tamarins sleeps close together.  Closer, a dapper-looking toucan rests in a hole in a nearby tree.  Accentuating the cooler climate at night, chilled evening breezes waft through with a cloying perfume lingering in their wake.  In the north, a formless mass rises, its details muted by distance."
