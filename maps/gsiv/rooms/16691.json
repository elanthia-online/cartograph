    "A large ceramic bowl of tropical fruit stands on an iron table on the far side of the room, attracting a host of buzzing insects to the area.  From the direction of the table wafts the scents of coconut and lime, drifting across the room on a subtle breeze.  Propped up against the whitewashed plank walls are collections of signs and notices, surrounded by cans of colorful paints and oils.  Several craftsmen sit along a workbench on the eastern wall, diligently at work with hammers and paintbrushes."
