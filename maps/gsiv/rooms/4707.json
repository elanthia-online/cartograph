  "description": [
    "The trapdoor leading back down to the storage room has been painted with a large bull's-eye in red paint.  Partially hidden behind a huge wall of trees and dimly illuminated by moonlight, the roof provides a perfect spot to rest and relax while contemplating life.  A dart board hangs above a copper urn.  Stored in a glass bowl on one side of a felt covered table are small red and blue tokens.  Brightly colored rocks hold down stacks of playing cards and, on the opposite side of the table, a leather-bound black book."
