    "Handsomely-textured tartans draped and gathered with braided gold silk cords hang from clear glaes rods, symbols from various clans and houses mounted as decoration.",
    "Thickly woven tartans and silks are draped across the room, suspended from burnished rods high above.  Matching animal hides create makeshift rugs beneath the wooden containers set out in the middle of the shop, the various creatures carved into the surfaces of a heavy cedar and oak chest and a lacquered mahogany dresser."
