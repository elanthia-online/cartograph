    "[Ebondrift, Clock Tower Balcony]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The balcony is fitted to what must be called the back of the circular clock tower, as it sits on the side opposite the platform upon which animated figures mark the passing of the hours.  From this vantage point, the view provided of the port of Solhaven is simply spectacular.  Upon the granite wall supporting the suspended gallery, bas-relief depictions of the dark gods are carved and outlined in a variety of metal leaf-work.  The salty tang and cool dampness of sea breezes blow freely through the air."
