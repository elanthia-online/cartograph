    "The broad sweep of the celadon marble floor is interrupted by a brilliant red hibiscus plant.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, an oil-filled silver sconce hangs on one of the brilliant cut-glass walls.  A carved haon armoire and a silk-covered dress mannequin are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
