    "A soft breeze brushes across the vine bridge, causing it to sway back and forth, before returning to a reasonable sense of stability.  Dry leaves on the nearby oak branches rustle in the wind, the quiet sound mimicking the low wheezing of hushed whispers.  A damp murky scent lingers in the air, its source unclear."
