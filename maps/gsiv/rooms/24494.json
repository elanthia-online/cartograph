  "description": [
    "Silver-swirled squares of ebon tile cover the floor of this light and airy kitchen.  A pair of tall arcing windows across from a marble archway allows gusting breezes to flow through the room, countering the heat from a large enameled stove that rests against one wall.  Copper pots hang from a circular rack in the center of the room, their surfaces polished to a brilliant sheen.  Standing against the far wall is a huge mistwood dry sink, with several woven baskets of produce piled to either side."
