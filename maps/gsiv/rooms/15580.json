    "The broad sweep of the wooden floor is interrupted by a hanging suit of brigandine armor.  Halfway to the nightscape ceiling, a tasteful rune staff display hangs on one of the smooth sandstone walls.  A twisted dark metal rack and a large oak table are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
