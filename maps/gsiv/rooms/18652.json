    "Higher than even the tallest spire of the temple, this clear ice chamber looks out over the city of Icemule Trace.  Even the floor is transparent, leaving no angle of the view obstructed.  This close to the heavens, and to mortality, it is easy to feel the touch of the gods upon you, blessing or damning as they will."
