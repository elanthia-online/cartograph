  "description": [
    "This corner of the courtyard offers a quiet spot from which to survey the impressive yard and imposing buildings housing the association of warriors.  Windows here offer a dim view into the interior of the building, where chandeliers hanging from high ceilings illuminate the carved wood paneling inside.  The promenade proceeds along the building's side to the north and leads off southwest to the front gate.  An arm of the cobbled walk also extends northwest, leading to the front steps of the Guild Hall."
