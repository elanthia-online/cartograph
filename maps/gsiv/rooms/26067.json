  "description": [
    "Stone benches line the remarkably smooth walls of the chamber.  Upon one bench, someone has left a pitcher of water for thirsty tourists, while upon another, there is a washbasin and some cloths that have been arranged for the hygiene-conscious.  Standing at opposite ends of the small landing, a pair of downward spiraling stairs affords passage below, while a large stone archway leads deeper into the mountain."
