    "A variety of colorful bricks have been used to create the path, resulting in a breath-taking mosaic that strays close to the ridge's edge.  An ornate invar rail protects the passersby and affords an unobstructed view of the hills below.  An alcove paved with small octagonal stones has been carved into the mountain, and a beautiful fountain wrought into the side trickles with a constant stream of fresh mountain water.",

Two large iron braziers cast a warm glow over the area, providing light and heat."
