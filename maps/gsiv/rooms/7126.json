    "Rats scuttle back and forth across the floor, chittering and squeaking and hissing at you, expressing their displeasure at being disturbed.  In the dust on the floor, you see a few footprints that are far too large to have been made by a rat, or by a normal rat anyway, but before you can examine them, they're obliterated by the smaller rats scurrying across them."
