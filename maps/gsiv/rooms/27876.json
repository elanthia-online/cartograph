    "Mahogany paneled walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above a scaled model of Hearthstone hangs a pearl-handled filigreed mandolin, and a mosaic tiled ceiling completes the picture.  A jewel-inlaid caddy and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet stand side by side in the middle of the room."
