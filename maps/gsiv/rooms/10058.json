    "[North Barrow, Inner Chamber]"

  "description": [
    "The chamber is roughly circular, the stacked stones of its domed ceiling rising twenty feet high under the highest part of the barrow mound.  Every inch of the ancient, pockmarked stone has been festooned with bones set into elaborate geometric patterns, the femurs and fingers and vertebrae and grimacing skulls of countless long-dead corpses.  A gruesome chandelier, crafted of more of the same bones, hangs from an iron bolt at the apex of the dome."
