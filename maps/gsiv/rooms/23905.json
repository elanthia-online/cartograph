    "This small platform is left open to the elements, with nothing overhead except a few sparsely leafed branches and the expansive moonlit night sky.  Wedged in a nook created where the platform meets the supporting branches is a plushly stuffed cushion, and across the rest of the floor is an assortment of colorful cloth mats.  A rectangular silver tray sits off to one side of the cushion, and above it, a windchime crafted of bits of vibrantly hued glass and shiny metals hangs."
