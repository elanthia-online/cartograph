    "Polished black marble peeks out from beneath the edges of a richly appointed ivory velvet carpet which stretches down the expanse of the hall.  A large nautilus shell serves as a vase for a collection of tropical flowers, including pink and yellow hibiscus blossoms.  A single window at the far end of the hall lets in sunlight and an ever-present, albeit faint, hint of an ocean breeze and salty air.",
