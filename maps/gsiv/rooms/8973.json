  "description": [
    "A brightly painted, lifelike mural depicting a forest meadow decorates the walls of this well-lit shop.  Mock-up windows hang upon the walls, giving the impression that you are in a house with an ecclectic arrangement of windows looking out into the wild woods.  Fenster beams proudly as he rocks back and forth upon his heels, his arms clasped behind his back.  A sign reads, \"Installing a Fenster window gives new light and charm to your home.\""
