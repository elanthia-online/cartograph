    "The broad sweep of the limestone floor is interrupted by a dusky blue cotton rug.  Halfway to the white stucco ceiling, a multihued Vornavian silk tapestry hangs on one of the dark blue textured canvas walls.  A Vornavian silk-covered table and a long carved oak counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
