    "Tight fitting stones of various sizes meet seamlessly to form the slightly curved outer wall of this tower room.  Thick flagstones, in a chaotically jumbled pattern, comprise the cold and barren floor.  Devoid of any decorations, save a battered toque atop a simple stone shelf, the room appears lifeless and empty."
