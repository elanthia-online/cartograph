    "This sparsely furnished section of the wagon has been partitioned off by a darkly varnished, panelled wall interrupted only by a silver-framed maroon wooden door.  A simple round wooden table rests against the wall underneath the three tall, rectangular windows beside a long wooden bench.  The shape of the windows causes long, blocky shadows to be cast across the floor, punctuated by stripes of bright sunlight."
