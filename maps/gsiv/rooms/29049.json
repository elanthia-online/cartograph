  "description": [
    "The charred surround of a campfire takes a prominent position beside the muddy pathway through this area.  Blackened bones, tossed haphazardly nearby, have all been cracked open, perhaps to get at the succulent marrow within.  Tall trees surround the space, their verdant growth blocking the view of the lands beyond.  The incessant buzzing of insects forms a symphony with the guttural grunts in the distance."
