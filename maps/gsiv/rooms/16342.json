    "A dirt path leads over a rise of earth and down towards a collection of mismatching tents and huts.  The rotting stench of the encampment's inhabitants lingers in the air, mixed with the aroma of cooked flesh and burning wood.  A heavy grey haze of campfire smoke hangs over the warcamp and drifts down behind the rise of land, creating a pocket of concealment from the eyes of the nearby Grimswarm."
