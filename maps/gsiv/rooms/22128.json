    "The majority of the smooth hardwood floor is free of clutter, though several discarded pieces of brightly colored costumery peek out from beneath a bed shoved into one corner of the room.  Bolted to one pale yellow wall at approximately waist-height is a polished wooden rail that runs half the length of the room.  Opposite, the chamber is reflected in a double-paneled mirror that stretches from floor to ceiling.  Gauzy blue curtains tugged by a playful sea breeze frame an open window beside the bed."
