    "Dimly glowing orbs hang from the ceiling, illuminating the hallway with soft golden light.  Braids of silver and gold trim bound the oak paneled walls and send glimmering runic traceries across the stone floor.  Carved crystalline archways stand in the east and west walls, and beyond them the soft sound of trickling water can be heard."
