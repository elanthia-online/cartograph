    "Sweltering heat radiates from huge copper vats which fill the room.  Suffocating waves of humidity wash over you with each breath you take.  Occasional whiffs of steam hiss, forced out between loosely-jointed pipes above your head, mussing your hair and singeing your ears.  A set of stout wooden steps disappears through the ceiling."
