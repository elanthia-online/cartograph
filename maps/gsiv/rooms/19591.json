    "Tangerine tiles spread across the floor of the foyer to the various paths that converge here, their edges bright white and their centers painted with dark green ivy vines.  Chiseled marble columns rise into the domed ceiling and are laden with wisteria blooms and vines that climb out of enormous earthen pots at their bases.  A pair of doors faces each other across the cool tile expanse, one fitted with a blue cobalt window and the other a rose one."
