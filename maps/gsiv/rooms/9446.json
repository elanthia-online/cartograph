  "description": [
    "Lofty ceilings mark the entry to the jail, the dark wood of the beams beginning the journey into the deep passageways.  The illumination provided by the two enormous torches on either side of the entry reveals the ancient markings of numerous pickaxes, delving into the earth to discover the valuable materials hidden beneath the unrelenting rock.  A large table stands against the wall, the prisoner log opened upon it."
