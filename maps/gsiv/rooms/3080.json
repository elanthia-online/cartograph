    "Rocks are visible within the northern icewall of the former quarry, the farthest projection into the hillside the project managed to accomplish.  Iron ore veins leach slowly out of the stone, leaving a trail of red flakes as dark as blood within the cold surface.  Remnants of avalanches have all but covered the mines, the entrances lost long ago in legend."
