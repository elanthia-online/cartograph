    "The surroundings are cloaked in mixed shades of light green and deep blue, only a few candles about you piercing the moody darkness settled over the area.  Water within a small pool upon the floor shifts and reflects the faint light in wavy cerulean flickers, its heat being more felt than seen amidst the rich hues of the room.  The warm glow of the candles causes a collection of pots resting upon a small table to glint softly as the tiny flames rise and fall continuously."
