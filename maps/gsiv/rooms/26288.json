    "Flatbed wagons carrying wood and rock lumbers slowly down the road, pulled by fiery-maned steeds and driven by ugly ghouls.  The path comes to an end near the wall of a tavern, where a number of grisly zombies and skeletons linger about.  A bone-inlaid stairway leads up to a elven hide curtain, which serves as an entrance to the tavern."
