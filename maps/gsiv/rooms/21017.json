  "description": [
    "Scattered light filters though the branches of tall, black bean-laden trees that surround a small pond.  The bottom of the falls to the east feed into the basin, creating tiny ripples on the surface, where a swarm of bugs skates over the water in a dizzying array of patterns.  Home to a colony of small beetles, a fallen tree leans out into the water.  The scent of fermenting wood rises from the log and lingers in the thick, damp air."
