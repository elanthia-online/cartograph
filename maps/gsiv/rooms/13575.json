    "An ancient battered tower shield hangs on one of the white brocade walls, and a high arched ceiling rises overhead.  A well-pruned lemon tree sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a long mistwood counter on one side of the shop and an elegantly carved oak armoire on the other."
