  "description": [
    "A dimly lit cavern opens up to allow passage of a glowing emerald stream barely a foot deep.  The stream fills the cavern from wall to wall, though, entering from a tunnel to the north and exiting through a tunnel to the west.  In a small alcove on the eastern wall, steps wind upward, following a chimney into the darkness.  A slight amount of fresh air wafts down from the chimney, but for the most part the air in the cavern is still and cool."
