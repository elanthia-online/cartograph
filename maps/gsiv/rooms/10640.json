    "[Neartofar Forest, Ridge]"

  "description": [
    "An enormous granite monolith thrusts out of the earth, towering over the rest of the ridge's stony spine.  Its commanding height affords a view of the entire forest for anyone foolhardy enough to climb its moss-slick sides.  Someone or something gained the apex, as a large circle of spruce branches rests atop the stone.  Where the monolith meets the ridge top, hundreds of spruce cones have been piled against the base, their partially-burned condition accounting for the sooty smudges on the granite."
