  "description": [
    "This sandbar, formed by some long forgotten flood, separates the small pool from the cold, deep water of the Locksmehr River.  The wind blows steady here bringing with it occasional sounds from the distant town.  A boat, the exposed wood broken and rotting, lies mostly buried in the sand, providing its inhabitants with a place of refuge."
