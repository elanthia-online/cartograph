    "[Officer's Mess]"

  "description": [
    "A set of brass gimbals allows the mess table to remain horizontal despite the awkward tilt of the deck.  Two of the four doors of a cabinet have sprung open.  The remains of the ship's china and crystal glassware, scattered about the deck, crunch under your feet.  In the crease of the deck and starboard bulkhead is a pile of simple steel cutlery."
