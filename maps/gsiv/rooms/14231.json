    "Candles line the walls, each ensconced within recessed niches that allows their soft light to fill the room with a warm, wavering glow.  Fanciful mosaics span the gaps between the niches, depicting scenes of nature and other whimsical artistic musings.  Delicate trails of emerald ivy tangle around an ivory arch to the east, interspersed with carved roses and other beautiful flowers."
