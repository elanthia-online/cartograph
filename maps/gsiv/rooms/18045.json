    "Brightly shining wall sconces contrast with the inky blackness of the narrow slit windows around the circumference of this ample, circular room.  The center of the room is dominated by three statues on a gleaming white marble pedestal, around which are clustered several inviting tables.  Stewards come and go regularly, clearing away used crockery and refreshing the food and drinks on sideboards lining the walls."
