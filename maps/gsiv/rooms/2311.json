    "An enormous stretch of city wall has been lightly scored and filled with a variety of local stones to form a mosaic of eye-catching color and wondrous detail.  Citizens and visitors alike stop to admire the piece, which elevates its surroundings from a forgettable backstreet to a key site of pilgrimage and meditation.",
    "Very few visitors disturb the shrine-like stillness of this stretch of Hope Alley.  Even by the light of moon and stars, the mosaic set into the granite defensive wall is worthy of notice."
