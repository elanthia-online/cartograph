    "A pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a mistwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A bronzed drake sculpture sits in one corner of a dappled celadon marble floor.  There is a vine-carved mahogany table on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
