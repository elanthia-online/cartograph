  "description": [
    "Wooden lattices are framed overhead to offer a small amount of shelter from the elements.  The barbican curves outward into a circular shape here, a lone wooden table with two straight-backed chairs arranged nearby.  Atop the table is the remains of a game,  the playing cards and jet-pipped ivory dice stacked alongside a half empty bottle of liquor."
