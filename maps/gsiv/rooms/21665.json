  "description": [
    "The candle-lit path leads to an expansive, circular cobblestone quarter.  In the center of the area rises a large sculpted ice totem surrounded by four dark rosewood benches.  Heavily-clothed townspeople move about, sipping hot drinks while chattering amongst themselves.  A trio of colorfully dressed halflings greet every passerby, offering a kind welcome and drawing attention to a huge frost-covered sign."
