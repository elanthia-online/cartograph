  "description": [
    "This dank, musty room looks like it was used as a cooking area of some sort, by someone not too concerned with hygiene.  Moldy dishes are piled high in a huge wooden tub and the acrid smell of some long-since-burnt animal lingers in the close air.  In the northern wall is a large, rectangular opening, and beside it a vertical slot with a chain hanging down."
