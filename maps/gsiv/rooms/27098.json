    "The wind whistles through the trees bordering the shoreline, rattling the umbrella shading a table occupying the shore and creating ripples across the surface of the water.  The feeling of seclusion in the lagoon's alcove is interrupted by the crash of distant waves, heard over the sounds of the local wildlife and the rush of the nearby waterfall."
