  "description": [
    "A brief glimpse of the cliffs can be seen through the trees as the terrain thins further from the lagoon border where moss and clusters of flowers create a lush shoreline.  Offering a slight reprieve from the heat, the trees manage to provide enough of a canopy to cast shade over a large bamboo hut fashioned with a wide counter."
