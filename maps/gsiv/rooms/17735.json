    "A thin cast iron railing separates this riverstone-paved octagonal patio from a field of blooming wildflowers bordered on a far edge by a line of great oaks and magnolia trees.  Centered in the patio is a polished wood workbench that is accompanied by a weathered yellow wood cabinet covered in simple carvings of phases of the Elanthian moons.  A wood chair sits off to one side with several dried red and gold-brown leaves resting on its arms and seat.",
