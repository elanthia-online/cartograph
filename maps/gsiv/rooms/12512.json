    "Two heavy-set dwarven guards flank the entrance of this large, vault-like room.  A reinforced steel counter and screen near the front blocks off your access to most of the room, but beyond it you can see shelf after shelf loaded with weapons, armor, jewelry, and trinkets of all kinds.  Some of the goods look well used and rather plain, while others display an extravagance typically reserved for nobility."
