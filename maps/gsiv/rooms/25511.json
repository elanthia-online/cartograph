    "Sprawling bay windows curve around the airship's forward bulkhead, providing an extraordinary view of the landscape ahead.  The windows are positioned immediately beneath the ship's massive avian figurehead, and its outstretched metal talons hang within view.  On the opposite wall, a bar of flame maple and golden oak panels is stocked with an impressive variety of liquors, spirits, and wines, the bottles backlit by a row of glimaerstone orbs.  Several stools sit before it."
