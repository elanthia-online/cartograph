  "description": [
    "Sky blue walls are accented with saffron yellow silk fans, each painted with elaborately detailed boughs laden with cherry and orange blossoms.  Pale yellow curtains fashioned of translucent silks drape in artful folds from both the glass-front doors leading to the balcony and the white birch bed that is decoratively carved in the semblance of a fruit tree.  Positioned kitty corner to a paneled door which leads to the hallway beyond is a low teak table surrounded by tassel-edged cushions and bamboo mats."
