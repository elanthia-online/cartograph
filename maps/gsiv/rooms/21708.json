    "The neglected battlements rise and fall along the dilapidated wall as it runs perfectly north to south.  The southern end of the wall ends abruptly with a long drop to the remains of a fallen tower below.  The thick evergreen forest that surrounds the keep's south side has encroached to the base of the wall, nearly obscuring the tower's remains."
