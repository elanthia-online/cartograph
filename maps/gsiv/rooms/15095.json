    "Beneath a skylight-set golden oak beam ceiling, a colorful silk healing herb chart hangs on one of the golden oak-paneled walls.  A series of golden oak shelves and a sunset red silk-covered table sit in opposite corners while a woven sunset red tasseled rug rests on a polished golden oak floor."
