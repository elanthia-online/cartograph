    "A ragged swath has been haphazardly cut through the undergrowth, leaving the remnants of brambles and bushes behind to snag the incautious.  The track clears to the south where a break in the trees beckons, though the nighttime sky pales in comparison to the twinkling lights alive on the track as lightning bugs put on a remarkable show.",
