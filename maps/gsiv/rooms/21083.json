    "Growing from the soft, moss-covered ground is an organized row of palm tree saplings, their broad palms woven tightly together to create a miniature shelter within the clearing.  Bright white stones marking the jungle's border branch off to the north and south, while a small path through the moss leads eastward towards the dock."
