    "Various furs, claws, and other bits and pieces of creatures are hung or mounted on the walls of this shop, displaying the skills of many adventurers.  A chandelier composed of antlers hangs overhead, the long candles in it currently unlit.  Open windows rest between the spoils displayed on the walls, allowing light to flood the room.  A long counter lines the back of the shop, an open doorway visible behind it.  Upon the counter rests a leatherbound ledger.",
