    "A long beech mantel topped with various ointment jars and bandages hangs on one of the faewood-framed clear glass walls, and an arched glass ceiling rises overhead.  An oversized flower pot sits in one corner of a sandstone tiled floor.  There is a tall faewood cabinet on one side of the shop and a spacious silvery beech counter on the other."
