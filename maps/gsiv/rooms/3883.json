    "Soft whinnying, snorting, and the stamping of hooves resound throughout the stables.  Stablehands are constantly on the move, fetching fresh horses for the travelling merchants, messengers, or guards who board their steeds here.  The stalls are clean and well-tended, and the horses seem content with their lots in life here in the Landing."
