    "While the tables are spaced far enough apart to ensure some measure of privacy, they stand in the center of the skylit atrium.  Like all of the tables in the room, this one is round and spacious, its heavy cast iron base supporting a carved black marble top.  Set at an angle into the stone is a black steel plate inset with seven white starstones in the shape of a gryphon--with one star indicating each leg, the tail, the beak, and one glimmering eye."
