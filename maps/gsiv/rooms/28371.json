  "description": [
    "Sheer white curtains of dupioni silk drape along the sides of an elegant canopy bed covered with a matching white spread and plump pillows.  Silver shaded oil lamps rest unlit on a golden oak table and two chairs by the window, and a pale oaken desk rests against the far wall, overflowing with bound parchments.  Centered in the wall facing the door is a hand-carved marble fireplace, over which hangs a painting in a simple silver frame."
