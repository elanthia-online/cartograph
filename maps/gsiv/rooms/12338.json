    "The Performance Hall green room is not a formal room, but instead an area nestled amid the curtains and scenery flats.  Ropes and pulleys hang down from a couple of catwalks overhead that span the expanse of the stage.  An additional array of ropes is contained in an intricate wooden frame, controlling the stage curtains."
