    "Yellow birches give way to towering black oaks that pierce the sky, casting long shadows across the heavy undergrowth of the forest floor.  Pale as fragments of bone against the dark hues of the surrounding foliage, cobblestones from some ancient path peek out amidst moss-coated rocks, thick roots and lush ferns.  Although the air is generally still, a slight inconstant breeze occasionally whispers through the trees.",

Pale as fragments of bone in the moonlight, cobblestones from some ancient path peek out amidst moss-coated rocks, thick roots and lush ferns.  Although the air is generally still, a slight inconstant breeze occasionally whispers through the trees."
