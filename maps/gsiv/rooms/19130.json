    "Pieces of sailcloth hang from the criss-crossed pattern of rafters above, their striped patterns decorating the small space.  Several racks of bows are hung from the walls, a wide variety available to choose from.  Several barrels stand to the side, arrows and bolts filling their hollowed bellies.  A fine selection of archery accessories are displayed on a narrow wooden counter, its length dominating the space.  A small doorway leads back towards the entry."
