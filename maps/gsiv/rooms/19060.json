    "A bunk and a wooden worktable almost fill the tiny cabin.  The bunk is standard issue, strung with hemp and adorned with a blanket.  On the worktable is an assortment of large needles and spools of heavy thread.  Bulky canvas, folded as neatly as the blanket, sits beside the table, waiting to be mended."
