    "Moonlight streams down from above, sending slivers of pale light through the area.  A combination of sounds rings through the air, from the buzzing of insects to the cooing of birds.  Darkness creeps in around the edges of the bare field, which is lit with small lanterns that throw off splashes of illumination.  Adding some life to the night are several nearby open-air booths and tents.",
    "Sunlight streams down from above, warming the air.  A combination of sounds rings through the air, from the buzzing of insects to the chirping of birds.  A small anthill appears in the midst of the bare field, which is otherwise embraced by ripe, green artichoke plants.  Adding splashes of color to the brown soil and nearby green sea of artichoke fields are several open-air booths and tents."
