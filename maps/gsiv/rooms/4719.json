    "Portions of the cobblestone road have fallen down the ridgeline that flanks the road to the southeast.  To the northeast a large chunk of the roadway is missing entirely, and the area is instead the province of a large indentation in the ridgeline.  The forest huddles against the edge, and massive roots from some of the larger trees extend out from the dirt face into the empty air.  The collapse of the ridgeline has forced the road to take a northern turn, sans cobblestones, into the forest."
