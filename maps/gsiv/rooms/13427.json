    "Spindly branches arc overhead, their leaves filtering the sunlight beaming down upon them into a hazy, soft golden hue as it washes over the surroundings.  Collections of rocks obscure the sparkling streams trickling underfoot, while creeping vines shroud the base of the different trees in the area.  Clusters of angelica grow between the gaps in the rocks, their tiny white flowers resplendent in the light.",

Collections of rocks obscure the sparkling streams trickling underfoot, while creeping vines shroud the base of the different trees in the area.  Clusters of angelica grow between the gaps in the rocks, their tiny white flowers like ghostly flames in the darkness."
