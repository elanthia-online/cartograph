    "Sunshine illumines the pale sandstone walls of the compound, heightening their pallor to a hazy ivory hue.  An intertwining pattern of chains and cables is artfully incised into the stone, coalescing at the center of the wall into an intricate coil.  The radiance of the walls is mirrored by the slabs underfoot, which are washed in burning white-golden light.",
    "Moonlight radiates off of the pale sandstone walls of the compound, silvering their pallor and making them shine in the night.  An intertwining pattern of chains and cables is artfully incised into the stone, coalescing at the center into an intricate coil.  The light of the walls is mirrored by the slabs underfoot, which drink in and throw back the spear-sharp glow of the desert stars."
