  "description": [
    "Lengths of viridian linen, bound to the high ceiling by a gold-wrapped frosted orb, create a swirl of fabric that stretches outward to the lacquered bamboo walls.  Opposite a small marble fountain, a mahogany sideboard stands on the birch flooring, and an ornate plaque, displaying a vellum ceremonial fan, hangs on the wall above.  Scattered in small social circles, and set at a distance from the room's various doors, are several settees and divans that provide places to recline.  To the north, a private hallway leads into the back of the villa."
