  "description": [
    "Clinging to the tall, stone privacy wall are the combined vines of white honeysuckle and purple wisteria, their mingled fragrance perfuming the moon-lit garden.  Lush green grass covers the grounds from the wooden door to the small gardening shack in the back section, which is surrounded by blooming flowerbeds.  Stretched between two towering elm trees is a striped canvas hammock, and a white marble bird feeder is flanked by carved benches."
