  "description": [
    "An elegant archway of grey-veined, pale white marble stands as a solemn attendant at the entrance to this small, riverside neighborhood.  Embraced by the thriving local flora, the lower portions of the marble columns have become entangled in flower-laden vines and lush, leafy creepers, whose natural beauty and slender tendrils seem to add to the quiet dignity of the carven stone."
