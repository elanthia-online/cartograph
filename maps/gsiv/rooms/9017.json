  "description": [
    "Faintly briney air serves to remind that the bay is close by, and enhances other smells noticeable.  The scent of cooking meats is redolent with the night breeze, thick with garlic and spices.  A lone bench sits next to a flight of stone steps leading down into a passageway, and offers a panoramic view of this sheltered hideaway and the night sky above.",
    "At this end of the courtyard, someone has tried to create a small vegetable garden.  Leggy tomato plants wind around their supports, profuse with yellow blossoms, yet there is no fruit forthcoming.  Pumpkin vines sprawl along the ground, anemic with yellowed leaves.  A nearby bench sits next to a flight of stone steps leading down into a passageway, and offers a panoramic view of this sheltered hideaway."
