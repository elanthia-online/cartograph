    "Nicks and scratches in the ancient interior of the hollowed-out tree indicate that it was purposefully molded by mortal hands at some point in its history.  Thick slime, brought on by saltwater and decay, coats the walls, which are also dimpled by bone white barnacles that trace a sinuous track from the thick, dirt-covered ground towards the dark canopy where they disappear.  Strangely free of debris, a small stone circle rests in the center of the space and is surrounded by larger sitting stones."
