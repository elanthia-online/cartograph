  "description": [
    "The path begins a slight incline to the north, forcing already weary travelers to exert more energy and willpower to continue onward.  The normal debris of the pass appears to have been physically moved in this area, forming small piles along the base of the stone walls.  Although a few larger fragments of stone remain on the canyon floor, the path seems to be easier to navigate."
