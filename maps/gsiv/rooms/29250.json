  "description": [
    "A bumped out area at the connection between the interior and front-facing railings is festooned with verdigris vines and blown glass blossoms.  The small landing overlooks both the main nave of the building and the former ticketing office at its glass walled entrance.  Across the open space, the far platform appears similar in design and aesthetics.  Even the exhibit cases resemble one another."
