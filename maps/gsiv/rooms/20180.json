    "Several padded chairs are placed about the room upon a thick, dark fur carpet.  Displayed around the small area is a series of wooden sculptures, each one a unique beast of unrecognizable origin.  A large iron-bound trunk secured with a thick metal lock rests against the far wall.  Flanking a thick wooden door banded with strips of hammered copper is a pair of glaes sconces, their light basking the room in a soft glow."
