    "Winter appears to have somewhat loosened its cold grip upon the verdant swath of lawn surrounding the stone building.  Flowers imported from a more mild climate much farther to the south line either side of the path that courses through a green sea of impeccably clipped grass.  A cobblestone path arcs away from the courtyard while a pair of large arched doors leading into the guild stand slightly ajar."
