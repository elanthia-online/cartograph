  "description": [
    "Illuminated by torches that are set at even intervals, this section of cavern has an uneven floor that is pockmarked with rust-hued calcite deposits.  Perched upon a crate, a scrawny half-krolvin lad dangles one foot over the edge of a white stone-encircled pit that is filled with ocean water.  Behind him, an iron-bound warped oak chest sits with a large padlock on it, while just to his right is a knotted hemp rope that leads out of the cavern."
