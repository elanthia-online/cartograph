    "The floor of this huge featureless cavern is covered with clean white sand.  Wisps of steam rise off a small underground pool nearby.  Bright luminescent mosses and lichens cling to walls of the cavern, providing a dim but steady light.  Far to the west end of the cavern, you can see what looks like a massive stone structure."
