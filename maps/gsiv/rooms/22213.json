    "Beneath overtones of woodsmoke, the air of the kitchen is peppered with delectable scents of roasting meat and baking bread.  In stark contrast to the symphony of scents, the kitchen is largely utilitarian.  Beyond a series of wide-bellied cast iron stewpots, wide countertops boasting neatly bunched vegetables devour much of its space.  Huge recesses in the walls host hearths cooking spitted velnalins and gaks.  A swinging oak door in the north wall stands opposite a smaller doorway to the south."
