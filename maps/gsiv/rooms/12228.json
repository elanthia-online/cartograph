    "Countless variety and number of tattered sock puppets have been impaled upon steel pikes planted in an icy field.  A few frozen patches of the once lush wildflowers can be seen; islands upon the sea of cold, packed earth.  Button eyes and some of the stitching have been torn forcefully from the toys, lying scattered around the barren ground.",
