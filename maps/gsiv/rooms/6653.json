    "A circular dais, with three small steps surrounding it, squats in the center of the room.  Standing alone on the dais is an altar formed from a block of black marble, the pale glow from the sphere overhead reflecting off of the veniom inlaid into its surface.  Lurking on the outskirts of this circular room, almost hidden in the heavy brocade tapestries adorning the walls, are statues, one for each of the Gods of Lornon.  Spaced between the statues are large candles on vaalin stands."
