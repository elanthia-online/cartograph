  "description": [
    "Fireflies wink in and out of sight as they flit through the olive grove.  The pallid light of the lanterns hung among the branches of the trees is enough to reveal the outlines of a few stucco buildings.  The air is redolent with the pleasant smell of ripening olives.  A blue riverstone bench sits beneath a particularly well-pruned tree.",
    "Birdsong drifts faintly through the olive grove, providing a delicate and melodious environment for the pastel-colored stucco buildings scattered among the trees.  The air is redolent with the pleasant smell of ripening olives.  A blue riverstone bench sits beneath a particularly well-pruned tree."
