    "Crystal stars suspended on silver filaments of alternating lengths dangle from the indigo velvet canopy, catching and refracting light from nearby candelabrum.  A glass-paneled hoarbeam armoire stands open opposite a set of a set of grey hoarbeam shelves, both displaying a colorful collection of wares.  A draped archway, partially hidden behind the hoarbeam armoire, leads back towards the entrance to the shop."
