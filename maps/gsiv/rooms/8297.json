    "This hut is stuffy and hot, and the air seems to sear your lungs as you inhale.  Through the murk and heat-induced haze, you notice the source of your discomfort is a raised earthen oven serving as a smelting forge in the middle of the room.  The embers glow fierce and red, and a crucible of molten metal is perched on a tripod amid the flames.  Forms and molds of various sinister instruments lie empty on the ground."
