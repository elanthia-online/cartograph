  "description": [
    "Pale golden straw covers the dirt floor of the small barn, while bales are stacked here and there about the area.  A row of stalls are built into the outside walls, their bolted gates are each painted a different color.  Leather straps, blankets, and tools hang from pegs stuck into the rough wooden planks that enclose each pen.  A pair of wooden shelves are built alongside a sliding wooden door at the back of the building."
