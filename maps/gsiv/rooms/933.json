    "The dry, chill air in the tunnel contains a hint of the dankness associated with wet, underground caverns, although a slight breeze occasionally moves through the dim passage, bringing with it the sharp, living scent of the surface.  A high whistle or eerie howl accompanies these infrequent gusts, as the cold wind blows through some opening or crevasse in the mountain."
