    "The walls of the cramped tunnel are pockmarked with a multitude of tiny holes, little streams of water trickling down from each.  Fed constantly by the small streams, the floor is slick and slippery with moisture, slime mold flourishing in the damp environs.  The globules of grey ooze glisten with a multicolored sheen, whorls of color swimming across their lumpy forms."
