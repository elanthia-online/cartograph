    "The lighting here is nearly non-existent, save for a small lantern high on the wall near the exit of a wooden chute and from a small opening in the ceiling.  The meager illumination dimly glows over some small wooden shipping crates, which are lined up against one wall in this crawl space of a room.  Marble-sized iron balls, covered in grit, grime, and rust, are trapped within the cracks of the dirty floorboards near your feet.  A rope ladder tied to an iron grappling hook is coiled on the floor."
