    "A pair of cushioned chairs bracketing a small table offer a great spot to sit and relax.  The eastern wall consists of a floor-to-ceiling wrought-iron screen adorned with intricate scrollwork, providing an excellent view of the courtyard.  Songbirds occasionally emerge from flowering bushes to engage in an airborne dance above the garden.",
