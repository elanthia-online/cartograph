    "Row after row of trays, plates, and utensils are neatly organized on a collection of carved ironwood racks.  A hollowed chamber, lined with giant ice blocks, contains a collection of meats, cheeses, and dairy products.  Sitting opposite the hollowed chamber is a long pantry lined with assorted dry goods and jarred vegetables.  Some small, wooden carts remain half-packed with goods awaiting delivery."
