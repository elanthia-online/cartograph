    "Lush, leafy greenery spreads out within the field, hiding the rhubarb stalks from the moonlight.  Several of the plants bear clusters of tiny, pale white flowers that nearly glow in the darkness.  Further out in the field, a gangly scarecrow hangs from a tall wooden stake.  As the moonlight shines down on him, the surrounding shadows cast him as a frightening figure.",

Further out in the field, a gangly scarecrow hangs from a tall wooden stake.  Despite his presence in the field, several birds circle undeterred though the developing crops.  Some are even so bold as to occasionally alight on his arms, cawing loudly before flying away again."
