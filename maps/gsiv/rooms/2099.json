    "As you traverse the catwalk that hangs suspended over the vats, you are very careful not to break the planking under your feet.  You can now see inside most of the vats and what you see disgusts you.  Where you thought you would see pickled fish, you only see small dead creatures.  It would seem that some came to drink from the vats, falling in and drowning.  Or perhaps some effect of the now putrid fluid caused their almost instant death so that their bodies slipped into the thick fluids in the vats."
