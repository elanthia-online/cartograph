  "description": [
    "This smallish, circular chamber seems to mark the beginning of a series of branching tunnels.  To the east, a long passage recedes into the murk, while a narrower one leads southwest.  Sepulchers line the walls, broken into at random intervals.  A tangle of roots on the northwest side of the chamber conceals the source of a tiny streamlet.  A channel in the floor of the tunnel cradles the trickling water."
