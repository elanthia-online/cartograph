    "The surrounding wold is dotted with plenty of trees, mostly in clusters or small stands no where near as thick as the dark forest to the northwest.  Gently rolling hills are divided by a wide winding road, making it difficult to glimpse much of a view.  From time to time as the pass shifts, a bridge and what appears to be an island can be seen towards the south."
