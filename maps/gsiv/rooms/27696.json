    "Wood-paneled walls in alternating mahogany and blonde coloration flank this portion of a long hallway.  Several brown leather sofas rest against the walls, offering a place to rest or wait.  In the middle of the room, a sign on an easel stands beside a row of metal chairs, while both attendants and barbers hover at the ready.  Set into the southern wall is a frameless full-length mirror and a curved brown arch, through the latter of which glimpses of the lobby can be seen."
