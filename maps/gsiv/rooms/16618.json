    "Beneath a domed limestone ceiling, a large brass Fash'lo'nae symbol hangs on one of the inlaid windowless limestone walls.  A claw-footed large bronze tub and a step-topped dark oak sideboard sit in opposite corners while a flickering tall iron brazier rests on a gold flecked blue lapis floor."
