  "description": [
    "The forward deckhouse sits just behind the foremast, two lifeboats lashed topside-down on its roof.  Raucous laughter can occasionally be heard from the crew's quarters inside the deckhouse, mixing with the melody played by a group of minstrels strolling the wharf below the Spitfire's rail.  Sitting forward of the mast, a forehatch gives access to cargo areas below deck.  A narrow flight of stairs leads up to the forecastle deck, and there is a narrow door leading into the forward deckhouse."
