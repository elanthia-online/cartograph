    "The most striking feature of the rooftop bedchamber is the bronze-framed glass ceiling, providing a marvelous view of the night sky.  The circular room's padded velvet walls are punctuated by curved bay windows paneled in smoked glass, offering a clear view out while simultaneously affording privacy from prying eyes.  A gossamer silk canopy bed is centered in the room with a lor-inset alabaster nightstand beside it.  Against the wall, an oversized clawfoot tub tempts relaxation, and an antique silver vanity set is nearby, supplying a perch for the day's preparation.",
