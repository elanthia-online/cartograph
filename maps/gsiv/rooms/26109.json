    "An overgrown mausoleum of flat grey stone dominates the area.  Shadows cling to it like terrified children to their mother, and a few brave plants climb up the walls in a quest to get closer to the sun.  Sitting atop the tomb is an immense raven, glaring down on everyone with unbiased irritation."
