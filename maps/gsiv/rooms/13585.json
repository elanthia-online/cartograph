    "An ancient Tehiri ritual mask hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an exposed pine rafter ceiling rises overhead.  A wooden ship's wheel sits in one corner of a warped pale driftwood floor.  There is a long brass clothing rack on one side of the shop and a warped treasure chest on the other."
