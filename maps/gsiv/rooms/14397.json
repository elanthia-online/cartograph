    "A brook trickles through a clearing, its crystal water polishing the smooth stones in its way.  Cottages sit in a circle around the clearing, sheltered by a canopy of sycamores.  Their dotted white trunks provide a striking contrast to the green of their leaves and the mossy banks of the stream."
