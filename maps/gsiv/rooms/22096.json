  "description": [
    "Although its ceiling is the predictable Icemulian low variety, the Feast Hall is none-the-less a cavernous room.  Dark-toned beams support the ceiling, and a massive stone fireplace occupies the entire east wall.  Therein, a score of halflings could comfortably stand side by side.  Blocky oak furniture arranged in intimate groupings is illuminated by a number of rectangular lanterns sitting in the room's corners on wrought-iron legs."
