  "description": [
    "Walls painted a shade of blue like that of a summer sky adrift with wispy clouds surround this rotunda.  The detail is so exact and refined that when combined with the wavering light from a row of tiny windows, shadows deepen and highlights change, giving the illusion of movement.  Were it not for the four white marble columns that meet the ceiling in bracing arches, the setting could be in the heavens.  Towards the back wall, a lapis lazuli altar is balanced on the wings of three golden pegasi."
