    "Little remains useable inside the abandoned cutter.  Any access to the rest of the vessel is barred by crumbling or destroyed portals and ladders.  All that remains is the hold which has been modified as a smuggler's hiding spot.  Chains hang from one bulkhead and torture implements sit patiently on a nearby table awaiting further use.  Humanoid bones litter the floor and a nauseating stench pervades the air of the hold."
