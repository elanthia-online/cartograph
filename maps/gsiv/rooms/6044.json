    "The farmland road ends at the western edge of the farmland.  The embankment separating the field and the road levels, allowing access to the corn field.",
    "The farmland road ends at the western edge of the farmland.  To the west the weeds cluster thickly, and beyond them the forest presents an impenetrable barrier to travel.  The corn field that parallels the road to the south also ends, the corn stalks competing with the encroaching forest shrubs and vines.  Many of these wild interlopers have been intercepted as evidenced by the large piles of cut brush and wood."
