    "A ring of weathered grey stones marks the borders of a shallow grey pool, its surface rippling quietly as a triad of tiny streams flow into it.  Fuzzy, deep green moss hangs in trails over the surface of the tiny pool, and miniature silver fish dart within its dark waters.  Sweet alyssums bloom within the cracks between the rocks, their pale white hue standing out amidst the darker-hued flowers and plants cultivated within the tranquil area."
