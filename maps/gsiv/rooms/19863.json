    "Stained glass windows and a matching dome dominate this space.  The blocks of limestone for the floor here have been picked for their imprints of ancient flora, forever entombed in stone.  Each window in the walls depicts a field; one is strewn with wildflowers, another is an orchard with trees bearing fruit.  The dome depicts gentle curves and whorls in myriad shades of blue centered on the portrait of a gentle-looking man with long, curly brown hair."
