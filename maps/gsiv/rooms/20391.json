    "Two sturdy silver stands, devoid of any extraneous ornamentation or embellishment, stand in the center of this room.  Suspended from the mistwood supports are frosted glass globes tinted a pale silver hue that match the overlapping throw rugs on the ground.  Small votives glimmer inside the glass spheres, banishing encroaching shadows."
