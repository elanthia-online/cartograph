  "description": [
    "A floor-to-ceiling ceramic tile stove anchors one end of the room, surrounded by piles of jewel-tone velvet pillows, beckoning residents to gather there.  Against the opposing wall sits an enormous iron-bound chest.  As candles cast their flickering shadows across the hall, members wander off to their sleeping niches singly or in pairs, drawing heavy silk curtains of deep emerald green for privacy.  The sound of soft snoring can be heard occasionally above the soft murmur of conversations."
