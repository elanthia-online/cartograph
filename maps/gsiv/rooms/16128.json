  "description": [
    "Wan starlight penetrates the thick canopy of leaf and vine where the trail meanders along the side of a hill, washing the landscape in cool silver and black.  A sweet smell of flowering vines wafts along the gentle breeze, but their color is lost to the dark.",
    "Darkness swallows the shadows thrown by sunlight through the trees, as the trail meanders along the side of a hill.  Deep green and earthy brown colors dominate the landscape, but flowering vines adorn the trail with a riot of vibrant hues."
