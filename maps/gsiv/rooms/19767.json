    "Water burbles happily down the many tiers of the enormous fountain in the center of the cavern, echoing off the distant ceiling and walls.  Radiating outward, woven verdant runners create distinctive paths against the pale stone floor.  Heavy curtains mark entrances to the guild's training rooms, each one embroidered with gold thread."
