    "Canted precariously to one side, the giant maple tree here seems to be hanging on by just a few roots.  Its trunk, cleft nearly in two by a lightning strike, is dry and charred.  Yet high above your head its branches are bursting with leaves and seed-pods litter the ground in all directions.  A small stream flows over speckled blue granite and plunges down the hill."
