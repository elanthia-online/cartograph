    "A large garden stretches out beneath the shadow of Moot Hall, where rows and rows of apple trees flourish in abundance.  In the center of the orchard stands a speckled dark grey granite fountain surrounded by hand-carved red oak benches.  Thick stone walls rise up behind the building, shielding the area from the rest of the town, and a carved wooden door leads back inside."
