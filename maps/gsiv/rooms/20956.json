    "Wide leathery leaves cover the branches at this height.  The depressions in the center fill with water gathered from the damp air.  Beads of moisture adorn a web that is spread between two branches.  Clinging to the side of the tree is a small black and green frog, its tongue flicking about from time to time.  Several vines hang from some of the taller limbs.  Just above, the canopy of the forest opens to a mist that hides the sky from view, turning it a milky white."
