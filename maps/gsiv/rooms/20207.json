    "Surrounded on three sides by low counters, the stall has an awning of violet that is dingy and faded at the edges.  Long, blackened iron chains dangle from the supports, displaying a wide variety of glass wares, while canvas sheets are arranged upon the smooth plane of the counter to display candles and matches."
