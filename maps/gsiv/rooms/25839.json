  "description": [
    "Rows of gold-wrought crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling and reflect against the lacquered rosewood floor, which stretches the entire length of the ballroom.  Ornate ivory arches line the north and south walls, while the entire eastern wall is set with a wide-paned window.  A marble-topped bar occupies a corner of the room, and various refreshments decorate its surface."
