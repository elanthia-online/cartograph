  "description": [
    "Cloaked in a wet mist, there is very little visibility in the upper limbs of the giant banyan.  A slick layer of moisture coats each surface, dripping down from leaf to leaf.  Fat slugs make their way between clumps of fungus growing up the side of the tree.  The irregular pattern of the branches makes several places suitable for resting.  Thick vines cling to the trunk as they twine about on their way to the ground below."
