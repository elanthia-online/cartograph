    "In lieu of window boxes, the shops lining this lane have hedges and bushes of various species along their storefronts.  The pastel blooms of the hydrangea and buddleia, now wet with the evening dew, glisten in the pale light of the moon.  A few of the shopkeepers have pruned their bushes into various shapes and animals, giving the street a slightly eerie appearance as the shadows cast them into ghoulish forms.",

    "In lieu of window boxes, the shops lining this lane have hedges and bushes of various species along their storefronts.  Hydrangea and buddleia bloom in a riot of pastel colors, while bright yellow berries wrapped in a lantern-like husk dangle from the small shrubs that surround a green-shuttered cottage.  A few of the shopkeepers have pruned their bushes into various shapes and animals, lending the street a whimsical appearance."
