    "Plush cushions lie in ordered rows on luxurious carpets facing a low dais.  Tendrils of grey smoke rise in sensuous spirals from incense burners placed at either end of the dais.  A pair of crossed waraxes hang on the cream-colored plaster wall at the rear of the room.  Brass lamps hang from hinged hooks on the wall.  Rolled bamboo blinds let moonlight filter in through arched windows, casting the room in a cool blue light.  Two massive green glazed urns, tall as giantkin, stand between the windows."
