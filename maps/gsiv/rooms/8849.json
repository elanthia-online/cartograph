    "The dirt road dips into a small depression as it turns, and the wagon-wheel ruts are filled with muddy water.  A patch of bright flowers, nourished by the relative dampness, thrives around a fence that borders a small group of cottages.  The discordant sound of someone engaged in much-needed practice on a fiddle echoes in the air."
