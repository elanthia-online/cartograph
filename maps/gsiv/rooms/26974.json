  "description": [
    "Dry heat radiates outward from the drakar rods that are erected within the dark sands of the surrounding gardens, the air rippling with their intensity.  Fulgurite spires, tall and brittle, cast long shadows across the terracotta pathway, while squat barrel cacti form a pale screen of brown and crimson foliage against the travertine walls.  Zorchar disks, strung from thick rafters beneath the enormous domed ceiling, randomly flare with electrical sparks."
