    "A dejected-looking corpse lies slumped in this cramped, V-shaped bend in the passage.  What remains of his rotted clothing is smeared with dark,  reddish-brown stains.  One frail, bony hand still clutches a crudely-made shovel blade, obviously ineffective against the wall of solid rock he encountered here."
