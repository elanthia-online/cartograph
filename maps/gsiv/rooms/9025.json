    "Thick wooden columns rise up from the dirty stone floor, offering support to the high celing.  Wall replicas fill the area, offering up a variety of furnishings for any owner's business.  Heavy lanterns hang from hooks inset into the columns, providing the area with enough illumination to browse at any hour."
