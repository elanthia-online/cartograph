    "Dangling from bronze chains, several frosted glass globes descend from the lacquered mahogany rafters to provide soft illumination for the various paintings that decorate the feather-patterned walls of indigo and ebon damask.  Opposite the displayed art, a picture window of tempered glass provides a view of the small garden at the heart of the gallery.  A decorative gold-accented loom occupies a space near the southeastern corridor and artistically displays a finished piece of cloth-of-gold embroidery."
