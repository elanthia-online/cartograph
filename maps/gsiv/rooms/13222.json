    "Walls of dark granite paneled in polished redwood encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a snarling timber wolf hangs along one wall, opposite a warm hearth.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the sweet scent of jasmine rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its dark brown linen snugly tucked."
