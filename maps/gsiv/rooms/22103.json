    "Oak shelves filled with music manuscripts stand tall on all sides.  In the room's center, a library table offers a place to sit and peruse the wealth of melody and lyric residing in those impressive stacks.  Wrought iron lanterns with delicate amber-colored paper shades shed a golden illumination, making the parchment of the tomes look like antique ivory."
