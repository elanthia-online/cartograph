    "The skeleton of a long-dead crocodile rests on a small island in the middle of one of the tanks.  Beside it lies what was probably its last meal, the remains of a half-eaten man in rotted leather armor.  The other pool holds a small variety of catfish, and a large school of minnows upon which the catfish feed."
