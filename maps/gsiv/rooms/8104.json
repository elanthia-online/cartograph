    "A bit north of the trail lies a patch of arable land.  Poorly growing turnips and potatos show off their stunted greenery.  It also looks like there is some type of farm equipment on the far side of the fields.  A pathetic-looking scarecrow fails miserably at its task, a black bird resting contentedly on one of its shoulders."
