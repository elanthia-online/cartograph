  "description": [
    "Moss-laden oak planks enclose the rear of the wagon, and the smell of various herbs is thick in the air.  A brass-bound ebonwood chest, its lid open wide, sits beneath a cobwebbed dark oak shelf.  Alongside the wall, an aged wooden stand displays an ornate carved jewelry box and a yellowed glass jar."
