  "description": [
    "Glass from a huge shattered window glistens from the wet grass of the yard.  The parts of the manor's back lawn that have not been drowned by the encroaching bog are lush with overgrown grass and flowering, black-trunked trees, the latter of which have grown into a grove around the ruins of a stone well.  Other trees, less cultured and more wild, grow in abundance to the north, fusing into a dense and foreboding wood."
