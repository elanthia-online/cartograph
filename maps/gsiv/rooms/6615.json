    "[Pentagram Chamber]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "This is a vast natural cavern.  The walls and corners are uneven, hewn from solid stone and cloaked in gloom.  What captures one's attention, though, is a colossal pentagram that covers the chamber's floor.  It is drawn in a multi-colored dust that glitters like powdered gems.  A jagged fissure in the floor crosses the symbol, sundering it completely.  Elaborately wrought braziers stand at each point of the pentagram like silent sentries."
