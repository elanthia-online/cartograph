    "Luscious damask covered benches flank either side of this cozy niche.  Chips of various dyes, bottles of fragrant oils, and wicks made of assorted fibers lay neatly arranged on a spotless worktable in the middle of the room.  Slabs of sticky paraffin and molds in a range of shapes are stacked in rows on some unadorned shelves."
