    "The ferryboat is a shallow draft boat with squared sides.  On the upstream side, two iron rings encircle the thick guide rope that keeps the ferry on its course from dock to dock.  A flat, narrow walkway is built into the downstream side.  The ferryman negotiates this narrow path, planting his pole into the river's bottom, walking backward to propel the ferry forward, then lifting the pole and moving back to the prow to repeat the action."
