    "Smoldering scents of rare herbs and delicate florals saturate the air inside the opulent room.  Anchoring the corners of an ornately carved counter, which is centered between mirrored shelves, are two jeweled censers.  Ringlets of amber-hued smoke lift gently from the vessels toward the ceiling's peak, only to be scattered by a breeze.  Rich in gemlike color, a thick burgundy carpet, embroidered around the border in various sacred symbols, spreads across the floor."
