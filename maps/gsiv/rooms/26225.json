  "description": [
    "In addition to serving as a hastily set up salesroom, this area also serves for quite a bit of equipment storage for the settlers of Reim.  Crude implements, discarded items, and assorted useless metallic shards have been piled into the various corners.  A series of chain loops hung from the ceiling displays a partial selection of the goods made available for sale to the public."
