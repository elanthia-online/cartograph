    "Heavy cloth-of-gold curtains frame a pair of windows, glinting in the sunlight filtered through heavy silk sheers.  A lithe elven woman, elegantly attired in a layered black duponi silk gown, moves serenely among the velvet-draped tables dotted about the room, adjusting their displays of glittering jewels and heirloom pieces to best advantage.",
    "Wooden counters topped with glass cases are scattered around the room, each holding glittering pieces of jewelry.  An elven guard stands watch in each of the four corners of the room, keeping a wary eye over patrons as they glance over the selection.  The jeweler, Tmareanth, glides around the room, helping customers as needed.  Hanging upon the wall is a black-inked sign.",
