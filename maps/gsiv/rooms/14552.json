    "Long-leaved grasses, in all hues from pale flaxen to deep emerald green, sweep across the meadow that comprises the largest section of the Anodhelesian tiger habitat.  A watercourse curves around the base of a rocky outcropping that rises toward the west.  Widening into a naturally slate-lined pool, the river deepens, partially dammed by fallen logs.  Live oak trees, draped in lacy, grey-green moss, provide a shadowy retreat."
