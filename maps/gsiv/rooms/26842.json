    "A massive black stove stretches the back wall, with a roaring fire visible within.  Large pots and pans cover the stove with serving wenches scurrying too and fro working on the stove or serving up a dish.  An equally enormous sink stands filled with murky water and dirty tankards, dishes and pots, with a pair of servant boys scrubbing away within the soiled suds.  Massive barrels of ales line a large pantry, foaming ale dripping from their spigots."
