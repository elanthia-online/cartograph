    "White alabaster and dark mahogany flooring are cleverly conjoined into the image of a giant roulette wheel.  Heavy tapestries hang from the walls, each depicting gamblers winning at different games.  Some shallow steps lead down into the roulette pit that are position between a gold-trimmed rosewood door and an expansive mahogany archway."
