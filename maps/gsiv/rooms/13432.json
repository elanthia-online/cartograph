  "description": [
    "A trio of exquisite chandeliers hang from the crystal dome, ablaze with hundreds of candles, and silvered moldings and elaborate tapestries decorate the walls.  The room is a sea of colors and sounds as dancing couples glide across the highly polished dance floor and others chat animatedly with friends and family.  In the far corner, a small band diligently plays current and local favorites, while through a nearby doorway a cluster of tables awaits those seeking a quieter alternative."
