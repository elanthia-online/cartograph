    "The low wooden eaves of the roof reflect wetly from the polished surface of a blond oak dining table carved from a massive single slab of wood at the center of the chamber.  Climbing through a high arch in the northern wall, some rounded riverstone steps ascend to the second level of the manor.  Mosaic tiles dance over the surface of the arch in interlocking patterns of opal and emerald tesserae."
