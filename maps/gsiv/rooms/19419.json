    "A small office populated by several species of indoor plants and several pieces of small furniture nestles just inside the marble arch.  An iron pipe extends from floor to ceiling in one corner, radiating heat into the room and gurgling happily every so often.  A desk, chair, and several bookcases gather together in the opposite corner as if afraid to come to close to the hot iron pipe.  Torches light the room, their flames reflecting off the white tile floor."
