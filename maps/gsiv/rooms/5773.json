  "description": [
    "A rare formation of red granite provides an opportunity for an odd artistic expression.  A crevice, suggestive of a knife wound, has been carved into one of the walls of this square room.  Thick waves of blood red granite seem to pour out of this crevice and collect on the floor below."
