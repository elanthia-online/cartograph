    "The ceiling has collapsed in this room, and the long row of wooden cabinets that once held the guild records for generations past has nearly been destroyed by the fire and exposure to the elements.  The heat here was so intense, that glass from the window looking out from this room melted, running down the wall to form a puddle on the floor."
