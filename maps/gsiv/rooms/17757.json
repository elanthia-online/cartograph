    "The oiled canvas walls of this expansive tent do little to keep out the chill of the arctic wind.  Hungry warriors sit hunched over the wooden tables, most clustered around the center of the tent, where a blazing fire-pit provides a bit of warmth.  Constructed over the pit is a massive spit bearing the carcass of some huge beast, which sizzles and drips fat into the fire, filling the tent with smoke and the appetizing aroma of roasting meat."
