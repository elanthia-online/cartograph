    "The muted illumination of day is all that the forest canopy allows, in contrast to the south, where a veritable wall of light shines down upon a ruined pave stone road, emerging from a trail leading northeast.  Pale moss hangs from branches overhead, trailing toward the earth and swaying in a barely felt breeze.",
