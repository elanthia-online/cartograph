  "description": [
    "Darkness surrounds this room akin to the inside of a cave.  Stalactites descend from the ceiling and the sound of dripping water can be heard at a regular interval.  A maze of differently sized stalagmites juts up from the floor, leaving enough space to walk.  A greenish glow emanates from a substance on the surface of the protrusions, allowing enough light to see.  A glass wall divides the patrons from the exhibit, the beady eyes of its occupants glinting in the half-light."
