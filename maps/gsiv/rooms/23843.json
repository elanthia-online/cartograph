  "description": [
    "This clearing is ringed by trees of varying sizes that grow so close together in some places as to almost form a living wall, while vines create curtains in the open spaces.  The scent of wood smoke lingers in the air, emanating from a roaring bonfire surrounded by a ring of stones in the center of the space.  Adjacent, a woven grass basket rests on a flat stone, and a pile of iron buckets stands at the ready.  Flecks of ash dance in the shafts of moonlight that penetrate the thick jungle canopy, and winding trails squeeze between the trees in several directions.",
