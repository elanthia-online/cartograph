    "A jumble of oddly-shaped rocks litter the path.  Some of the stones appear to have been worked by tools, but abandoned before finished.  Patches of lichen have taken over some of the stones while others are strangely bare.  A stream parallels the path before flowing off an overhang of rock to the west.",
