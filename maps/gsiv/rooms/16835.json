    "A narrow passageway is roughly cut through the granite rock, and the edges of the passageway's floor are covered with a thin layer of dust, although the center appears relatively clean.  Still, with no lighting sources other than the small bit of lighting that intrudes from the ends, it is difficult to see the exact condition of the area.  At one end, the passageway widens out into a short hallway.  At the other end, dancing firelight flickers beyond mithril curtains."
