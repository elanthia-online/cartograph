  "description": [
    "This area behind the partition is small yet cozy.  Lush tapestries depicting scenes from a royal bathhouse drape the walls.  Resting on the ground by the tent wall is a bed of nails with a small table posted nearby.  A three-legged stool sits near a sharpening wheel, while a standing mirror accompanies a small vanity that is covered with a multitude of lit candles.  Tucked behind the vanity is a wardrobe filled with garments of various colors."
