    "Pressed against the ivory wall of the lunar basin, this section of Liabo is frigid and enveloped in the cold darkness of space without nary a shred of starlight breaking through the protective hemisphere of arcane energy.  Golden tiles, uneven and cracked, traverse the landscape in a sinuous trail that avoids the larger craters that pockmark the rough rock.  Faintly pulsing, the hum of a nearby glass-lined ring does little to mask the irregular thumps of meteorites striking nearby."
