    "An imposing keep rises out of the surrounding mist and fens to dominate the view to the northeast.  Encircling the keep are great earthen bulwarks decorated sporadically with gnarled willow and sycamore trees, designed to prevent any encroachment towards the walls by the fens.  Widening from the animal path that wound through the weeds, the trail broadens into a narrow dirt road leading towards the keep."
