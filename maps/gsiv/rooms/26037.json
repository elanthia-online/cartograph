    "The golvern-edged propellers of the ship glow silver in the moonlight, casting a wavering blur of reflected radiance over the smooth-worn and polished planes of wood below.  Fanciful tracery forms golden vines that twine up the trio of cylindrical supports leading to the whirring blades.  A dark teak hatch fastened with a black iron ring lies to starboard.  Unmarked crates and wooden barrels have been stacked high and lashed down near the railings."
