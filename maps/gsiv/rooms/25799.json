    "A huge black marble island sets off the kitchen from the rest of the house, and hardwood stools lining three of its sides provide dinner seating for twenty.  The kitchen itself is well-equipped with a large steel sink, several ovens, and a stone fireplace, but the fixtures do not appear to have seen much use."
