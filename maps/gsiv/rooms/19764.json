    "A multitude of shelves and cabinets line the smooth wall, filled to the brim with healing supplies.  Neat, linen-draped cots form two rows down the length of the infirmary, each station equipped with a utile, polished metal stand.  Residing in each corner is a giant luminescent toadstool, the glowing fungi providing more than adequate illumination for the delicate work performed here."
