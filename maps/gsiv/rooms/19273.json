    "Fire has destroyed most of this room.  Charred shelves filled with ashes and the remains of countless volumes of books and scrolls line the walls.  Several tall desks occupy the center of the room, like the stumps of lightning struck trees.  The brass lamps suspended from the ceiling on long chains are covered with soot and a patina of green and grey corrosion."
