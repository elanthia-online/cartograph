    "The sharp sides of a small cabin on deck loom nearby, casting a slight shadow on this side of the ship.  The deck holds an immaculate polish, the grain of its deep grey wood coated with a flawless shine.  Several curved silver charms hang from the roof of the small cabin nearby, the wind occasionally causing them to clang against one another to produce a beautiful cascade of melodic tones."
