    "The dirt path ends here.  From this vantage point, you look out over the river and plain which stretch for countless miles south.  Carried from there on a warm breeze, you hear the faint whisperings of secrets waiting to be revealed, treasures to be found, and adventure to had, and the darker promise of death to the unwary and the unprepared."
