    "Sparse but comfortable living arrangements await the guild's servants at the end of the duties.  Several people apparently share this room, as there are four sets of neatly made beds and wooden chests of drawers, one occupying each corner of the small room.  The southern wall bears a mirror set into an oaken frame, greeting entrants with their own reflections."
