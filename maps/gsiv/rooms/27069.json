    "A leafy vine-covered arch offers a break in the thick foliage surrounding the forest.  Fresh animal paw prints mar the soil and veer off the footpath leading deeper into the woods.  Tattered pennants and flags are tangled in the foliage, along with other debris from the celebrations that were once held here."
