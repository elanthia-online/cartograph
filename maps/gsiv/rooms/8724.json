    "An air of opulence surrounds you here.  A large, round aquarium dominates the center of the room.  Scattered in a circle around the aquarium are several extremely large, overstuffed blue lounging pillows which look very comfortable indeed.  This looks like a very good place to sit and talk with friends or merely while away the hours.  A blue silk curtain separates this lounging room from the business area of the shop.",
