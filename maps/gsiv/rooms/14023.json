    "[East Wing Corridor]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "This corridor is quiet, and the decorations here are minimal.  A soft carpet woven with several hues of complementary wintry shades matches the lacquered white monir of the walls.  A soulstone-inset door stands between a pair of triple-pronged candelabrum affixed to the walls, and opposite is a rose-carved white willow door and a black ironwood door.  The hallway terminates here, where a polished mahogany arch leads further into the manor."
