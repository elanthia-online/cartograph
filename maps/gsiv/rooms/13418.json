    "The intricate, sweeping architecture of the manor can be glimpsed between the gaps of the dark ivy that twine about the tall gates enclosing it.  The ivory-hued cobblestoned path curves around a small stack of ancient grey rocks, a small stream of water trickling down them like a miniature waterfall.  Flame-bright tulips line the edges of the water, their vivid hue brilliant against the sunlight.",
