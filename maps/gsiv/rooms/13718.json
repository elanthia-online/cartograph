    "Darkness shadows the hues of the myriad vining roses, but their fragrance still fills the air, and moonlight glints off a mother-of-pearl mosaic depicting women heading to the baths lying at the foot of a vine-covered red sandstone arch with a wrought iron gate.  Each column along this section of the cloister is surrounded by potted herbs such as lemongrass, verbena, and sage.",
    "Awash with vining roses in myriad cheerful hues, this section of the cloister is filled with fragrance.  Blaestonberry vines in full bloom crawl up a red sandstone arch, tiny offshoots tentatively stretching towards its wrought iron gate, and a mosaic comprised of mother-of-pearl and colored sandstone shows women heading to the baths.  Each column along this section of the cloister is surrounded by potted herbs such as lemongrass, verbena, and sage."
