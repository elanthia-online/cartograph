    "Small crevices and pockmarks mar the otherwise smooth surface of the stone walls, providing no more than a few inches of sparse shelter to the small denizens of the pass.  Carefully chosen twigs and strands of dry grass fill some of the tiny nests, although the diminutive engineers that built them remain hidden within the blanket of the night.",
