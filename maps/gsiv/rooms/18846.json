    "Twin twilight blue carpets cascade down the aisles among the tri-sectioned rows of cushioned, mahogany benches.  Suspended above, a glass ceiling reflects and refracts the starlight, sending it scattering to every corner of the room.  At one end of the auditorium lies a crescent-shaped dais of silver-veined alabaster flanked by three large marble columns, each housing brilliant scarlet owl sconces, which cast a warm glow.  The banners of Twilight and the CHE hang in tandem from the translucent ceiling.",
