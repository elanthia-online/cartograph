  "description": [
    "Mangroves, willows and cypress trees shade the broad wooden walkway.  Tangled roots are fenced in by small wrought iron islands, keeping the paths to the surrounding houses clear and level.  A faint chorus of frogs sounds from a northern pond, the sound marking a nearly invisible spot through the trees."
