  "description": [
    "Fresh rushes, comprised of dried chamomile, lavender, and wormwood, are strewn about the floors of the tavern, though their rich herbal fragrance does little to hide the scent of stale ale and vomit.  Chairs and benches are arranged in small groups in the open space, which is illuminated by torches set at even intervals upon the rough pine walls.  An iron-edged oak bar dominates one corner and stands guard over a thick wooden door that leads deeper into the establishment."
