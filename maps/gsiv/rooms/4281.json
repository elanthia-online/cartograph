    "Underbrush gives way to thick meadow grass where the trail begins a steep ascent.  A tall hill fills the southeastern horizon, its gentle slopes adorned with patches of green and gold pasturage.  Dwellings are visible, nestled on the slopes in colorful groups, their sod roofs blending with the hill's thick mantle of grass."
