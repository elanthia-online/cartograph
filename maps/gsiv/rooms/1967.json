    "A pair of massive iron doors are set in the sheer rock wall.  The sharp scent of sulphur from somewhere beyond stings your nose.  Torches in roughly carved red-veined marble sconces flank the entrance, their bright flames almost obscuring the ruddy glow showing from somewhere behind the doors."
