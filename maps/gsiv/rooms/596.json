  "description": [
    "Imbued with a sense of great age, the interior of the Shimmarglin Inn is both dim and chill.  A thick crimson rug flows across the stone floor, its bright rectangular expanse contrasting against the dark marble flagstones.  A pair of lancet-shaped windows frame the silver-inlaid oak doors leading to the outside, their segmented panes casting a pale, filtered light across the scarlet floor.  The entire room feels calm and serene, sensations more akin to a library than a public inn."
