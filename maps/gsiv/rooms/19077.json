    "Richly grained paneling lines the corridor bulkheads and the deck is carpeted with a plush runner in vivid tones of melon, marigold and indigo.  Brass lamps with opalescent glass throw a warm glow over all.  A blue door and a green door lead into cabins open to starboard and port, while a carved modwir door hangs at the hall's end."
