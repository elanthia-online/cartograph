    "The small corner of the wagon has clearly been dedicated to sewing.  Scraps of brightly coloured linen, cotton, and silk are strewn about a large oak work table.  A small tart-shaped pin cushion is studded with needles, while lengths of thread dangle from the edge of the table.  A scattering of small cushions decorate the floor."
