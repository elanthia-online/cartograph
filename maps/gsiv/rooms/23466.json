    "Although the area has a wide berth, its markedly low ceiling, barely high enough for a Giantman to stand, creates the impression of a cramped space.  Plush underfoot, an expansive red velvet rug covers the majority of the wooden flooring, its fabric matched to the velvet lining the shelves and glass cases set upon each wall.  Dappled light spills in through a small porthole that gazes into the ocean outside."
