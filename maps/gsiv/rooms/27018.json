    "The stairwell opens to a floor of obsidian and ivory tiles arranged in an arabesque pattern.  Upon the tile floor sits a series of walnut worktables.  One large central worktable supports an array of beakers, vials, flasks, mortars, and pestles.  A crystal alembic refracts the multi-colored rays of moonlight that filter through a gothic stained glass window.  Resting on another table are bandages, bowls, and a variety of blades.  Suspended from a ceiling beam is a wrought-iron rack holding jars of alchemical ingredients."
