    "Moss-covered ladders lean up against the stout trunks of the metal trees in the area, with barrels and tools near-at-hand.  Tumbled pieces of glaes have been hung from several of the branches as decorative ornaments.  Set behind some of the giant toadstools toward the wall is a large pile of rocks, most likely removed from somewhere else within the cavern."
