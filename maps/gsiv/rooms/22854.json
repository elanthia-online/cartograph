    "Surrounded by a ring of pallid stones, an enormous crater disrupts the verdant foliage of the swamp.  Muddy streaks, cracked and brittle, decorate the upper ridge of the cavernous expanse, while stagnant water pools at its base.  A series of rotted planks lie across the spongy, moss carpeting that lines the eastern edge and provides safe egress from the area."
