    "Rough currents yank and pull you in one direction only -- back toward the inner area of Darkstone Bay.  All around you, the ocean swells rise up high, crashing down in churning splashes of sea foam and water.  Small bits of kelp float along the surface, and beneath you, the kelp beds are clearly visible through the dark, but clear, water."
