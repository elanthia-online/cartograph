    "You're standing at one end of a huge domed cavern that could easily swallow Wehnimer's Landing with elbow room to spare.  The ceiling curves up smoothly, suggesting that the cavern was formed as a bubble that solidified.  A ledge runs around to the north and southeast.  About three manheights below your feet is a pool of molten rock, a deep orange webwork of cracks around solid chunks of black crust."
