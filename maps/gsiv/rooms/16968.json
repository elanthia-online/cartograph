    "The surrounding walls are tinted a deep black, imparting the illusion of being within the depths of a cavernous chamber.  Faintly seen along the edges of the blackness are crystalline spokes, their deep violet hue barely glimpsed in the hazy gloom.  A pulsating luminescence filters in from the north, and the faint hum of power echoes from the same source."
