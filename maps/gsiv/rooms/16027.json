    "The lindenwood walls are stained a light shade and hung with portraits of the Gladberry family.  The room is quite spacious, and the high ceiling lends it an airy, comfortable feel.  A smiling halfling stands behind a low counter, offering free samples of fine vintages.  Sunlight beams down from the skylights, and the delicate scent of a flower garden floats in through an open door to the north.",
