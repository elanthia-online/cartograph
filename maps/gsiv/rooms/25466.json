    "This section of the pavilion is a bit cramped, with a scarred and stained oak table occupying nearly the entirety of the back wall.  A small wall-mounted case is fixed above the table, and across the way is a tiered oaken bow rack.  An aged parchment sign has been tacked to the lower edge of the wall-mounted case."
