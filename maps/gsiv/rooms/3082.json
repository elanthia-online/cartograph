    "A rack of ice tongs lies fallen in the deep snow, unused and virtually forgotten.  A row of houses nestle up against the outside wall of the quarry, having been constructed by an adventurous few thumbing their noses at the avalanche reputation of the area.  The last few scrapes made by the workers can still be seen in the escarpment."
