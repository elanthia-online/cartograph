    "Large gnarled roots run along the walls and roof of this tunnelway, likely the only support for the soft earth forming this passage.  Dim light peeking through a jagged hole overhead is managing to provide a bit of illumination for this otherwise darkened lair.  Curious grunts echo from all about, the sound magnified by the claustrophobic terrain."
