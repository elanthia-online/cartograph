  "description": [
    "Within the gatehouse, a deep shadow is cast by the surrounding granite walls.  Rows of iron sconces are mounted along each thick wall to hold flickering torches.  Above the torches, the walls are dotted with arrow slits, and high overhead, a series of murder holes can be spied.  A massive iron portcullis leads to the keep's formal courtyard, while shining eahnor gates exit to Amaranth Court."
