    "Pale grey-blue masonry surrounds you in this rather small shop, its architecture beautiful in a simple way.  Ivory patterns flow across a crystal-paned counter, and the wares within sparkle in the ample light.  Small gold-studded chests line the walls, each shadowed by the numerous cherry-red shelves above."
