  "description": [
    "One very large tent of green canvas stretches across the entire space overhead, offering abundant shelter from the elements.  The front and side flaps are rolled up and secured with leather ties, leaving the swamp in full view.  Sturdy, hand-scraped oak poles support the weight of the heavy fabric, giving even the tallest guests plenty of headroom inside."
