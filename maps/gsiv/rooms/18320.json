    "The branches of nearby trees on the shoreline extend over the lagoon, breaking apart pallid shafts of moonlight with their leaf-laden forms.  Though the humidity of the jungle is still prominent, the coolness of the lagoon at night provides respite as the water laps back and forth gently.  The calls of nocturnal birds and the distant twinkle of fireflies flitting in and out of the jungle nearby join the moonlight glistening from the black surface of the water, creating a beautiful nighttime escape."
