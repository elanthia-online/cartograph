    "The walls of the alcove are comprised of various crates stenciled with incomprehensible inscriptions.  Toward the back of the enclosure, an especially large container has a series of curious glyphs on it that seem to shift and change if you stare at them long enough.  In one corner, a chipped barrel and a battered trunk have been tucked neatly beneath a chipped and weathered table.  A swaying overhead lantern sheds a pool of warm, yellow light down on a large treasure chest and a brass and modwir dresser."
