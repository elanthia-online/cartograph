    "Pale blue silk panels drape from a silver ring set at the top center point of this small tent.  The space inside the ring is open to the air, and sunlight is reflected in a shining collection of mirrors set around the tent.  A flap of blue silk leads to the back section of the tent, but the opening it makes is almost barred by a sign placed squarely in front of it."
