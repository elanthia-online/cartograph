    "High, thick basalt walls rise in every direction, demarcating the perimeter of the compound.  Outbuildings dot the area, some with the dim glow of candlelight reflecting through their windows.  A red sandstone keep rises from the center of the bailey, its doors directly opposite the portcullis and lit by brass torches.",
    "High, thick basalt walls rise in every direction, demarcating the perimeter of the compound.  Outbuildings dot the area, the industrious sounds of the work going on inside echoing through the yard.  A red sandstone keep rises from the center of the bailey, its doors directly opposite the portcullis.  Grass and gardens grow between the numerous footpaths between outbuildings."
