    "Alabaster slabs thrust upward in the form of a lotus flower, presenting a series of concave walls and hidden conversation nooks.  Reaching twice the height of a pure elf, the tips of the carved stone petals intertwine to form a complex vaulted ceiling.  A despanal-veined pedestal casts a dull scarlet glow from the center of the room."
