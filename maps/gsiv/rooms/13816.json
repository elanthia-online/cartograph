  "description": [
    "Caerphily Creek sings a pretty melody as it trips over the stones and bits of broken logs in its headlong rush toward the lake.  Moss and watercress add touches of green to the clear water, mirrored by thick ferns growing on its banks.  One cottage occupies the clearing formed by a ring of oak trees around the stream.  A trail of stepping stones leads to its door, the way bordered with edges of primroses."
