    "The well-lit tunnel slopes down towards a thick, clear glaes wall.  Hard-packed earth, littered with large stones fills most of the space on the other side of the barrier.  Enormous tunnels butt right up against the viewing surface, offering a look at a juvenile roa'ter in its underground home."
