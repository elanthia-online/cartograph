    "The passage ends here in a roughly circular room that stretches just beyond your sight.  Several iron rings line the entire wall, some with nothing attached while others hold lengths of rusted chain.  Along the north side of the chamber are several wooden barrels that are stacked neatly to one side and chained to the wall."
