    "The tall spires of the citadel itself loom ominously overhead.  Remarkably, the whole structure looks relatively untouched by the raiders when compared to the desolation surrounding it.  Loud claps of thunder and lightning burst above you, the clouds and mists obscuring the uppermost parts of the structure."
