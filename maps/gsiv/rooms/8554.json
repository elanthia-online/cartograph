    "This beautiful meadow is deep within the mountains and slightly southeast of the rugged peak known as Lyftoth.  The wildflowers that grow here are fragrant and plentiful.  The dainty petals of the blaeston seem to reflect the brilliant colors of the alpine sky.  Traesharm berries grow in startling abundance and small patches of the strange Dreamer lichen can be seen clinging to a few of the exposed rocks.",
