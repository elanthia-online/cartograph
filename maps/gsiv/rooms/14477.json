    "Tall, straw-colored grasses cover a long expanse of flat land, its area unmarked by trees.  The tops of a few large boulders can be seen, their sides tickled by a multitude of hollow yellow stems as the wind blows through the hot, dry area.  The grasses roil and fall with constant motions, giving the place an illusion akin to a flaxen sea."
