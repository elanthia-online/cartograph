    "The ancient wall that bounds the field curves from south to northeast, its stones nearly crumbled into rubble by the gnarled roots of a large oak tree which has outgrown the boundaries of its original planting over many decades.  A shady path is visible leading from the other side of the fallen stone to the nearby grasslands."
