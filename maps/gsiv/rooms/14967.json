    "[Small Cottage, Courtyard]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Thick woods surround this courtyard, extending a feeling of security and tranquility.  An outdoor grill made of clay bricks sits to one side, and several modwir chairs sit around a table on the other.  A varied assortment of relaxing sounds drifts in from the woods, and the quiet pool just a short distance out from the cottage.  You find yourself thinking how wonderful it would be to just come here and relax at the end of the day."
