    "[Rogue Guild, Courtyard]"

  "description": [
    "The courtyard before you is roughly square in shape, its borders a melange of textured stone and wooden walls made up of the back and side walls of the surrounding buildings.  The ground is paved with irregular slabs of dark stone interspersed here and there with patches of bare dirt or tufted grass, and a few weeds and bushes have taken root along the walls.  The courtyard is old but well-kept, and a patch of sunlight in the center nourishes a lone tree."
