    "Snow covers the ground, although the snow is not very deep and seems well packed.  Clouds exude from a fog bank to the north, dropping snow flurries for a time before retracting again.  The wind rushing down the eastern slope of the mountains carries most of the snow westward, though, leaving only a small covering.  Occasionally, with the help of the wind, the fog bank rolls back enough to reveal a conifer forest standing to the north and northeast."
