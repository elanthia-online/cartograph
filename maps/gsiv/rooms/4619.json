  "description": [
    "This enclosed area looks remarkably like a graveyard, with a large brownstone crypt standing at the center of a garden of blank white marble headstones.  Beside the crypt, a boulder rests with a brass plaque set into its surface.",
    "Blank white marble headstones dot the uneven landscape of red-veined creepers and thick crabgrass, the bulk of which is yellowed and hovering between life and death.  An immense brownstone crypt stands at the center of the dying garden.  The ancient cypress leaning over it boasts a wealth of gnarled branches, the black, finger-like shadows of which strain over the austere cenotaph.  Some reach so far as to brush the bulk of a boulder with a brass plaque set into its surface."
