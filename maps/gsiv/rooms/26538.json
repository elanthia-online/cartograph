    "Occasional swirls of silvery mist crawl across the dark rock ground, obscuring sandy footprints.  Ragged canvas sailcloth has been draped over an arched wooden frame.  Several wooden boxes and packing crates are stacked near the front area of the tent, while a large woven tapestry divides the space leading to a separate, more secluded area."
