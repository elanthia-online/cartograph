    "Devoid of the mist that covers most of the surrounding jungle, the sandy path ends abruptly in front of a sheer rock face that juts from the jungle floor.  Covered in flowering vines, it is a wall of deep green vegetation covered with white and purple blossoms.  Areas of the rock are clearly visible, as though someone or something had removed the growth.  High above, there appears to be natural cave openings weathered into the stone, but no way to access them from the ground below."
