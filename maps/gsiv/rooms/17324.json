  "description": [
    "Water, warmed by small fires below the tub, swirls around you in a soothing rhythm.  A small silver tray attached to the rim of the tub provides a convenient spot for soap and oils to be placed.  A polished silver spigot pours a continuous stream of water, while excess water spills out into a channel surrounding the tub.  A pair of candelabra, one at either end of the bath, lend a warm glow to the water.",
