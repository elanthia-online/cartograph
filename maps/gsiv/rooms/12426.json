  "description": [
    "This spacious showroom glows with the heat and warmth rising from several sample firepits, the red coals and burning embers within them popping and crackling occasionally.  The rich aroma of burning pine logs floats lazily in the air, enveloping Flavian and his customers in a homely bluish haze."
