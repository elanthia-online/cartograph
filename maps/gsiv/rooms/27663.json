    "Quasi-circular in design, the rotunda-style walkway of this portion of Clovertooth Hall mimics the round shape of the frosted red and ice blue-hued glass dome far above you.  A candle and crystal chandelier adorned with pearlescent saber-tooth tiger incisors on a long, golden chain fills the area with the amplified glow of refracted candlelight.  Set back a few feet from the top of the stair, a tiny halfling child statue leaning casually against a decorative railing serves as a bit of conceptual installation art.  Younger visitors passing by stop to strike a pose beside it before their parents shoo them on."
