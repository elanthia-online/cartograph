    "The winds roar around the peak like banshees frenzied by the ruthless winter.  To the northwest, the slope descends, bearing the path upon its back as if it would shake off the interloper at the first opportunity.  In an eastern direction, the trail levels off a bit before it begins to climb around the steep slope in a precarious cant."
