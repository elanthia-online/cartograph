  "description": [
    "Occasional trickles of dust slowly sift down from above and cover the veins of pure white quartz that run through the walls of this large, hollowed out section of the mine.  Small indentations and holes, where ore was removed from the rock, scar the walls like pock marks.  Along one wall, an old wooden door has been placed upon two sawhorses to form a makeshift table.  Beside it sits a small mine cart, which is missing three of its wheels.  Amid the rubble of a collapsed tunnel to the west, some of the broken timbers have been split up and used as a set of rough shelves."
