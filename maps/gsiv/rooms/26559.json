    "Dark iron spikes and lengths of chain secure mismatched lanterns to the high ceiling, each shaded flame shedding a corona of amber in an otherwise black headway.  The entirety of the back wall is dominated by multi-tiered shelving set behind a stained driftwood bar attended by a row of high-backed stools."
