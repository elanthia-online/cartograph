    "The bulkhead and ceiling near the small ship's oven are badly charred.  Smoke-blackened pots and pans hang from a grating overhead.  Sacks of flour, bags of rice, and burlap packets of cocoa have all split open, covering the tilting deck with a slick, crunchy, sweet-smelling mess.  Wooden ladles and spoons, once neatly organized on a shelf, lie a-jumble in the corner."
