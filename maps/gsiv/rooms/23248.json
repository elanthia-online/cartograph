    "Smooth granite walls rise from a stone-tiled floor to a concave gilt ceiling far overhead.  A gargantuan tiered stone dais supports a massive white marble table in the center of the chamber.  Empty suits of full plate armor, each wielding a sword-shaped crystalline lantern, stoically stand guard in each corner, facing the dais.  The north wall bears an elaborate fresco of both muted and vibrant colors, and the walls to the east and west are decorated with long tapestries depicting acts of virtue."
