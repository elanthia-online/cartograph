    "The earthen walls of this tiny burrow are shored up by thick modwir beams that have been polished to a soft dark golden sheen.  Flames dance in the grate of a small fireplace centered on the back wall, bringing a warm cozy glow to the space.  Colorful braided rugs carpet the hard-packed earthen floor.  Displayed on stands and on racks hung from the wooden beams are musical instruments of various types."
