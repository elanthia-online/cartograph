    "Small ebonywood dining tables are situated such that every diner has a magnificent view of the countryside:  River's Rest, the river below and the Citadel of Elanith above.  Oaken frames supporting massive panes of glass make up the walls and ceiling of the circular dining area.  Bustling servants seem to be at your shoulder at your slightest whim to satisfy your every need."
