    "Cross-beamed and wainscotted, the room is rich with the aroma of wood oils and the dry, woody scent of preserved timbers and parchment.  A necessarily ample array of illumination is ensconced upon the darkly panelled walls, alternating with stuffed, deck-to-overhead bookcases.  The scattered small reading tables are not without their own sources of lighting."
