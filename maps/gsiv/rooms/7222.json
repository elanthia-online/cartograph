    "A low altar made of grey stone sits against the far wall of this cul-de-sac.  The markings that once covered it have long since been obscured by spiderwebs and ice, leaving the god it once honored a mystery.  Gnawed bones sit haphazardly about it, perhaps gifts to appease the forgotten deity.  A chill breeze stirs the air, tickling over your skin."
