    "Once-beautiful flower gardens surround you.  They are dead now, dried into corpses of the colorful blooms of the past.  The rubble of ruined stone benches litters the ground, and the walls containing the area are crumbling slowly into dust.  To the north is a bower of dead vines, which arch over the remains of a modwir trellis.  A warped door leads back into the sanctuary to the east."
