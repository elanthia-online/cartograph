    "Resting on an elevated section of the faded wood flooring, a serving cart appears ready to topple over from the weight of its burden.  Thick layers of sawdust mixed with straw cover the floor completely in some places.  Strategically placed to offer a modicum of privacy, as well as to hide gaps in the floorboards, a tall serving counter is centered amidst a score of wobbly tables with stained and discolored tablecloths."
