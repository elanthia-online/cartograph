    "The mineshaft ends abruptly in this cavern.  The rear of the area is a huge pile of randomly strewn boxes, crates and chests.  Along the north wall of the cavern is a hastily made display rack while the against the south wall sits a stack of long wooden crates that have been pried open.  Various dwarven workers move gruffly about their business paying you absolutely no attention."
