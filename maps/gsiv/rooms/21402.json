    "The shabby staircase exits onto a long, narrow platform that is framed between a feeble, broken railing and mannequin foot-mounted wall.  Protruding into the walkway, the feet force travel to the far side of the hallway - the side which supplies a straight-down, stomach-dropping view over the railing of the lower floor of the shop.  Opposite the staircase, on the other end of the hall, is an archway leading further into the shop."
