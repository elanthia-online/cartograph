  "description": [
    "The clang of bells and the shouting of dockworkers announce the arrival of each inbound vessel at the deep water end of the pier overhead.  Dark, dry sand filters through cracks in the walkway above as the heavy boots of the workers dislodge the accumulated grains and send them raining down atop the heads of those below.  Tiny rivulets of water seep from the moisture-laden ground and trickle outward toward the water's edge."
