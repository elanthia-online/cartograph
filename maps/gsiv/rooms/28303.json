    "Bathed in shadows, an unusual garden encircled by seven trees spreads across this side of the long rectangular platform surrounded by darkness.  The northern area of the platform is sectioned off, demarcated by a tall wall of woven roots that protrude up from the distinctively dark soil.  Clogging the air with its intensity, the stench of cruor and decomposition gleefully cavorts around weaker nectarous notes.  Descending down to ground-level is a stairway of small boulders, with a gate situated midway down."
