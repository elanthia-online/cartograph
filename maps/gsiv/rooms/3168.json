    "The trail is slippery from the patches of ice that intermingle with the snow drifting down to the frozen embankment of this once fast flowing stream.  The surface of the stream has long since solidified under the merciless arctic conditions.  A light breeze blows across the frosty surface nudging the snowy particles to dance about in chaotic swirling patterns."
