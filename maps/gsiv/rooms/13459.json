  "description": [
    "A grove of trees stands around a grouping of stone cottages at a bend in the pebbled lane.  The dwellings are picturesque, with steep eaves and red-clay tile roofs.  The doors are painted bright colors, and shutters on many echo the doors' hue.  To the southwest, Tyro Pond is visible through the tree trunks, its surface shimmering in the moon's caress.",
