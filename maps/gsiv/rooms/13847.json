  "description": [
    "A squat cavern is ringed with carved granite beasts, which consist of a wolf, a lion, and a bear, that sit between the mouths of tunnels leading away into the underground gloom like silent sentries.  The fantastic statues are exquisite examples of stone cutting, each one displaying a lifelike demeanor.  Almost below a level of hearing, the low susurrus of rushing water provides an undercurrent of sound in accompaniment to flickering mithril braziers along the stone walls."
