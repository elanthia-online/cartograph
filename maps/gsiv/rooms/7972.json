    "The courtroom is uncomfortably chilly and plainly furnished.  Several benches are lined up to face a raised platform at the far end of the room.  The town magistrate dispenses justice, swiftly and summarily, seated in the straightbacked chair behind a simple table on the platform.  An armed guard leans against the wall, next to the door, looking casual but ready for trouble should it arise."
