    "At the center of this small alcove sits a sizeable boulder, its surface craggy and dark, with a silver-limbed jewelry tree perched atop it.  The twining roots of the tree spiral and twist down to embrace the boulder in such a way that belies the fact that silver is inanimate rather than a living substance.  From high above, moonlight falls in multihued shafts across the tree, tinged in silvery jewel-toned hues by the stained glass window.",
