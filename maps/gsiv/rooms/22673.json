    "The absence of a ceiling allows the moonlight to come flooding in, lighting up a bright blue pool in the center.  Teak chairs surround the pool, each with a closed parasol attached to the top of it.  Seashells and crab husks are tied to the teak planks circling the room.  A bamboo male mannequin and a teak female mannequin stand neglected in the corner of the room.",
