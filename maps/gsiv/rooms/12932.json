  "description": [
    "A pair of large, stone memorial statues flank a narrow rutted muddy road leading to the graveyard.  The statues depict figures kneeling in humble supplication, and the shattered remnants of a silver-edged onyx sword lie in the path.  To the north, an overgrown path leads to a dark, unmarked building."
