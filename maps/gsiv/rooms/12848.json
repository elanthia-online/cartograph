  "description": [
    "The alley is narrow, passing between two large stone buildings whose eaves almost touch far above.  Oddly shaped cobblestones have been laid at an angle, sloping towards a trough that is littered with small scraps of leather and broken feathers and runs towards the market.  Large crates, some broken, line the walls."
