  "description": [
    "Clouds of misty air roll out of the corner of the passageway, their presence caused by the existence of water warmed to the point that it flows freely over the wall of ice, in a steady, gentle sheet.  The water disappears through a narrow gap between the floor and the wall, with no sound betraying how far the water might fall once below the walkway.  Several brightly blooming flowers are planted in clay pots that hang from the ceiling, enjoying the benefit of the mist-warmed air."
