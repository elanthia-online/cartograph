    "The partial skeleton of a troll hangs from a pair of manacles bolted to the wall of the small damp cell.  Discarded bones lie beneath the skeleton and scattered across the floor, next to a pile of rotting skins, hides, and even more bones.  A dark green moss covers much of the wall opposite the door, filling the room with the smell of earth, and a cold dampness that lingers in the air fails to overpower the stench of decomposition emanating from the pile."
