  "description": [
    "Dozens upon dozens of colorful flasks and ampoules are strewn across the worktable and a counter spanning across a goodly portion of the low-ceilinged room.  The remainder of the room is filled with a scattering of benches and chairs, several of which are topped with various odds and ends.  Especially startling in the dim lighting, glowing stains of bright blues and greens are splattered across the black walls in a sort of artistically messy display and reflected in a series of tall mirrors."
