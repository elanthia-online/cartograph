    "The trail emerges from the claustrophobic stand of trees into a clearing overlooking the bank of a lake.  To either side, the trees block more than a cursory view of the water's edge.  On the lake's opposite shore, the trees continue in an even thicker wall reflected within the blue mirror of the lake's surface.",
