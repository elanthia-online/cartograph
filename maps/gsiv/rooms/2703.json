    "The great glacier grinds its way down the canyon, pulverizing rock and mountain alike.  An icy slope serves as the leading edge to the mighty frozen river inching its way towards the flats of the polar cap.  Deep tracks in the permafrost hint at creatures eking out an existence in this bitter climate."
