    "[A Dark and Damp Grotto]"

  "description": [
    "A middling amount of wan light slides in through the craggy fissure in the rock, affording just enough illumination to see the shadowy profile of juts in the earthen walls.  Underfoot, the ground slants sharply down within the first few steps, the incline deluged with streams of watery indigo sand from outside.  The way is treacherous, but at the base of the slope is a feeble violet glow that originates from points beyond."
