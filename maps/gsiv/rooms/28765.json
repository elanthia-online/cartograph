  "description": [
    "Ice sculptures depicting rampant mules guard the entrance of the courtyard, shaded by old maples with snow-heavy branches.   Across from an expansive pine-framed lodge, a genteel resort is framed by the forest beyond, its roof of blue slate aglisten with rime and graupel in the starlight.  At the center of the yard, a white marble statue of a halfling woman in a heroic pose dominates a cylindrical plinth of polished obsidian.  The contrast between the colors is striking."
