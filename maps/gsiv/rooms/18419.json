    "Big cross-braced doors lead into the red barn, though one of the doors hangs slightly crooked.  A dilapidated stone well sits near the white-washed fence that borders the property.  On the opposite side, a rusted-out plow overgrown with weeds and wildflowers has been partially covered by a dirty black tarpaulin."
