    "This area of the workshop is clearly intended for alchemical research.  Everywhere you look there are beakers and globes of various colored liquid.  The air has a heaviness to it, and the combination of scents in the area are nearly overpowering.  An elaborate cupboard dominates one wall, replete with tiny cubbies, each of which is filled with a different small vial.  Skins filled with liquid hang from pegs on the other wall, each one labeled in a cramped, hard to read script."
