    "The southeastern curve of the plaza looks out onto the eastern rock face of a torchlit stone grotto far below.  Carved into the face are countless contorted bodies, sculpted as if caught in paroxysms of pleasure.  The features of its base are concealed by the curve of the surrounding rock formations.  Out on the waters near the grotto, the silhouette of a dock is barely visible in the darkness."
