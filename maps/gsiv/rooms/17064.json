    "The stone room is absent of any sign of the devouring jungle.  The only sign of disrepair is a sizeable hole in the ceiling and the associated rubble on the floor beneath it.  Illuminated by the moonlight entering through the celing are the floor stones, revealing multiple random discolorations and a workbench of matching appearance.  Empty glass jars and beakers line several wood shelves along the walls."
