    "Widening from the walkway into a large rectangular area, the paved courtyard is flanked on the east and west by low palisades of traceried stonework at a comfortable height for sitting.  To the north stands a sturdy, grey granite building with a banner of lavender silk draped above its double doors.  In the center of the court, a glass bubble protects a patch of bright red-purple flowers surrounding a scroll-shaped reflecting pool.  Wintry sunlight refracts in prisms off of the glass and water."
