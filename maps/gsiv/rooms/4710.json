  "description": [
    "The road meanders through a cluster of blue spruce trees, their short, light blue needles standing out in sharp contrast to the long, deep green needles of the conifer cousins surrounding them.  The layer of needles underneath the spruces has been disturbed, the needles pushed up into clumps in several areas and the bare ground exposed as if someone or something had purposely cleared the spots.  A small brook cascades down from the north then veers west and disappears."
