  "description": [
    "The murmuring of the falls echoes from the east, mirroring the mellow babble of the northern river as it joins the diverse melody of the jungle inhabitants rustling about the wilds.  Densely clustered vines dangle from the sweeping branches of high-reaching trees, their leafy spirals sprouting blooms of amber, apricot, and carmine flowers.  A family of spider monkeys hops from one tree to the next, their curious chatter resonating within the hazy mist of the jungle canopy."
