    "With a lacquer in its final days, the dark hardwood flooring appears dull under bright lantern light.  A display case, accompanied by a shoe rack and equipment hooks, clutters the front half of the room opposite a stage backdropped by a tall burgundy crushed velvet curtain leading to the backroom.  The pale yellow walls are embossed with ornate columns separated by top-fastened black velvet drapes, offering the appearance of windows."
