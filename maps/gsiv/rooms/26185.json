    "Underneath a protective sheet of glass, a thin layer of sand has been glued onto the pine table in the shape of a majestic castle.  Tiny sandsilvers and shells have been imbedded into the wood, forming an alternating pattern just beneath the turrets of the castle.  Silken flags top the turrets, having been tacked to the table in a rippled pattern as if they were fluttering in a breeze."
