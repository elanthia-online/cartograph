    "Beneath an uneven soot-stained ceiling, a ship's lantern hangs on one of the smooth stone walls.  A plain pine casket in a freshly dug hole and a jumbled pile of unmarked boxes and crates sit in opposite corners while a ship's figurehead carved in the shape of a bawdy mermaid rests on a sand floor littered with debris."
