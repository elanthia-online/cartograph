  "description": [
    "Huge odd-shaped boulders form a ring, perhaps a crude shrine.  Glyphs and runes have been scratched into the stones, their origin and meaning both unknown.  This is as high as you can climb, and the breathtaking view gives the illusion of being atop the clouds, gazing down upon the world from heavenly heights."
