    "Drilled into the brick walls are floor to ceiling shelves, their expanses spreading north on both walls toward the library.  Frosted glass-front cupboards frame a small closet which is hung with a dark green curtain that hides its contents.  A copper and oak footlocker is set at the curve of the wall and has rags, cloths, dust pans, and several brooms propped up inside it."
