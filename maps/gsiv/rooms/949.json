    "Trapped within a thin, needle-shaped crevice in the rock wall, a tattered length of leather dangles limply, its thread-like ends undulating slightly in the breeze, like the strands of a horse tail.  Perhaps at one time a belt or harness strap, the leather strip has been harshly weathered, its original purpose unknown."
