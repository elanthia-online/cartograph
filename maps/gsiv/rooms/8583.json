    "The cool breeze off the mountains in the east offers little respite from the sticky air as you travel along the bank.  The east wing of the castle complex can be discerned, and the pall of the menacing edifice is ever across your path, the jagged gaps atop the ruined outer walls casting sharp, fang-like shadows.  The breeze suddenly shifts, bringing the lapping sounds and rotting water weed smell of the moat to you.  A tall, gaunt structure atop the small hummock due east diverts your attention."
