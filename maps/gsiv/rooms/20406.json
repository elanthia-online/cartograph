    "Spanning the entire room is a wide algae-stained glass tank filled with brackish water.  Within the depths of the liquid is an enormous peat-covered burgee.  Strewn across the floor are the decaying remains of fish heads and other various sea creatures.  A large sign hanging over the tank reads, \"Noos tap da glass!\""
