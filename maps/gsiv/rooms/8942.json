    "Wax-sealed jars, each labeled in neat, yet spidery script, are deployed along the shelves in orderly rows.  Apothecary's chests, their drawers labeled in a matching script, stand beneath the shelves on sturdy legs.  A granite workbench with mortars stationed on it at even intervals occupies the center of the floor."
