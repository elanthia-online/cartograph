    "Wandering between boulders the height of a giantman and even thicker, the path of stones branches into four arcing lines.  Ferns are interspersed with bird of paradise plants, their heads nodding in the breeze.  Dragonflies bring their colorful display, hovering over geometric, yet curvilinear, drawings on the boulders.",
