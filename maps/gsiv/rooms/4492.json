    "A rolled-up rug placed near the entrance to the room provides a small obstacle to the patrons entering and exiting this corner of the shop.  A partially empty weapon stand rests near a heavy hide curtain leading further into the shop.  A few framed paintings of various mountain landscapes lean against the walls, waiting for someone equipped with wire to suspend them from the reinforcing beams around the edges of the ceiling."
