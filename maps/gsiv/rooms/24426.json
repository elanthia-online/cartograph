    "Bales of straw in ranks on the northern edge of the clearing prop up colorful archery targets.  Most targets are traditional concentric circles, but some have been embellished with whimsical caricatures.  None of the comically rendered faces are recognizable, thanks to the archers' accuracy.  An expanse of pale river sand spanning the length of the clearing makes arrows easier to find and keeps grass from overtaking the range."
