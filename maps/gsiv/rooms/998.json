    "Water trickles out of a clay pipe set high up on the north wall.  The water falls into a long, deep, metal trough.  Dwarven men and women arrive from the south and west carrying various types of containers.  They dip the containers in the trough, filling them with water, and then return in the direction from whence they came. The action of filling the containers slops a great deal of water on the stone floor, creating a slippery, slightly treacherous surface."
