  "description": [
    "Rising sharply along the mountainside, the grounds are green and well-tended despite the stark banks of snow scattered here and there.  The hewn blocks of native granite that comprise the the abbey are dark with time and worn by the elements.  Huge stone urns are spaced along the walk, holding blossoming roses bushes that seem unfazed by the cold.  Nearby, broad stone steps lead to a wide, uncovered porch with a low balustrade."
