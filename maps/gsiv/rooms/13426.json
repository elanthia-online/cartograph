  "description": [
    "The high walls of the manor rise far above the shady boughs of the trees, its intricate architecture shrouded by the leafy branches.  Swaths of colorful flowers of every hue grow along the edges of a gate that bars access to the massive estate, while tendrils of dark green ivy twirl around the wrought-iron to further obscure what lies beyond.  Clusters of snapdragons grow alongside the cobblestoned walkway, their dark blue and violet hues blending in among the surrounding foliage."
