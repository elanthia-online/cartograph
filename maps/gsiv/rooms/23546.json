  "description": [
    "A row of oak shelves, holding a wide variety of food and stored goods, lines the walls of this rather large pantry.  Three globes, hovering soundlessly just below the teak ceiling, cast a warm, bright glow around this tidy space.  Nestled under the shelves, a white enameled stove sits between an onyx marble wash basin and an arched stained oak door, which leads back out to the parlour.  The floor, done in black and white marble tiles and inlaid with the golden wyvern of House Vaalor, is spotless."
