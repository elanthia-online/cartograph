    "The natural beauty of sinuous rock formations hanging from the ceiling and rippling along the walls is offset by the rows of primitive cages squatting on the cavern floor.  None of the cages have living occupants, and though some contain evidence that they were once used, the dim yellowish light from swarms of glowing insects reveals no specifics about the cages' contents."
