  "description": [
    "The trail winds around the western side of a particularly large glaes formation.  Its opposite side is blocked by a bubbling pool of magma.  Steam mixed with smoke drifts up from the pool, enveloping the rock form in a shifting mantle.  In the haze, it takes on the appearance of an old, stooped giant clutching its cloak as the wind whips the garment about."
