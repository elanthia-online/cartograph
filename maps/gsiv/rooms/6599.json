  "description": [
    "This western tower offers a good view of Lough Ne'halin and the vast, green 'ocean' that is Noralgar Forest.  Save for the splendid view, the room is empty.  The walls, built of solid stone, are now inhabited only by the small-minded creatures scurrying around in the ruins of past greatness -- when horns had sounded and swords had glittered, and armies had marched out through the castle gates."
