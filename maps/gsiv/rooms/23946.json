    "A large driftwood raft serves as flooring in this makeshift tent of dark sailcloth draped on rope-strung wooden poles.  A battered, steel-banded oak trunk sits next to a fluttering tent flap across from a pair of featureless mannequins.  A hammock of patched netting is strung from the poles in one corner, next to a small table."
