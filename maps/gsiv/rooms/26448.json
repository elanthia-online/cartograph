  "description": [
    "Mis-matched boards of various sizes and woods create the walls of the shack, more shipwreck salvation than original design.  The slight scent of wood smoke wafts in from the shuttered windows, rattling slightly with each gust, adding hints of hickory, maple, cherry, and other fragrant flavorings used for the varety of wares on display and for sale here.  One wall features a large yet faded diagram of porcine anatomy, the various cuts marked with dotted lines."
