    "Stretched along the far wall, a beautiful tapestry depicting the symbols of the six Dai layers with the woolen walls to ward off the damp cold from outside.  A pair of brass lanterns hang from the rough pine framework of the tent.  Thick woven carpets cover the rough plank floor, their lengths buckling slightly under the weight of a small wooden counter.  Several crates are tucked to one side, their contents shadowed in the corner of the room."
