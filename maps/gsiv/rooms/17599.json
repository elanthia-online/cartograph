  "description": [
    "The path twists and turns, opening into a small clearing of lush vegetation and clusters of wildflowers interspersed between blades of grass.  From the moss blanketed trunk of an oak, tendril-like branches overhang a clear, deep pool of water, bordered with verdure and flat stones.  An untidy stack of wood rests adjacent to charred earth upon which a fire pit nestles."
