    "The passageway ends at three extravagant-looking doors.  In the north wall, a gilded crimson door bears a plaque that reads, \"Warden's Office,\" while to the east is a heavy silver door and to the west a heavy golden door.  The latter two doors are obviously cell entrances, evidenced by the heavy locks securing them from the outside.  Some steep stairs lead up to the higher parts of the prison and eventually to the exit."
