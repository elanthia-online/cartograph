    "Scraped clean of snow all the way down to dirt level, a long narrow lane is delineated by long stripes of white paint set with white-painted pebbles.  A chasm lies at the far end of the runway, and a row of yellow warning flags has been hammered into the ground about two giantman-strides short of its edge."
