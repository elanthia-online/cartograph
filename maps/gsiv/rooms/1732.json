    "Despite the harsh climate of the area, life does seem to take hold even here in the frigid heights of Gossamer Valley.  In a pocket of daytime warmth by a dark boulder, bunches of light grey sawgrass poke up tentatively from the exposed ground, waving slowly in the filtered wind.  The serrated blades stand no more than a couple feet high, and, judging from the pruning done to some of the plants, something has been grazing on them.",
    "Despite the harsh climate of the area, life does seem to take hold even here in the frigid heights of Gossamer Valley.  In the reflected sunlight and sheltering warmth of a dark boulder, bunches of light green sawgrass poke up tentatively from the exposed ground, basking in nearly twice the sunlight of the surrounding area.  The serrated blades stand no more than a couple feet high, and, judging from the pruning done to some of the plants, something has been grazing on them."
