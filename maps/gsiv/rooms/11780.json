    "It looks as if the residents have attempted to scratch out a clearing, but already the tenacious growth of the marsh can be seen sneaking around its borders.  A few scant gardens are dotting the front yards of the modest shacks, but most of them have been overtaken by the wiry vines of the swamp.  Clearly it's a losing battle."
