  "description": [
    "Through a series of holes in the wall, the wind howls with great ferocity.  Bits and pieces of shell have broken free from a sculpture when it was flung into the westernmost pillar in the chamber.  A faint yellowish grey tinge covers the stone tiles and blocks in streaks.  The frame of a painting sticks out of a pile of rubble."
