    "A large wine-hued silk tent occupies this relatively flat spot on the expansive meadow.  Small flowerpots have been placed at intervals around the tent's exterior, each boasting a different hued rosebush.  Flanking the tent's open entrance, twin pink rosebushes climb miniature trellises affixed to their pots.",
