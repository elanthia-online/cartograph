    "The passage dead ends here into a small room with bits of chain strewn across the cavern floor.  Several small piles of bones are scattered throughout the chamber, apparently discarded after being picked clean.  The stale air reeks of death and decay causing you to gasp for breath as the stench overcomes you."
