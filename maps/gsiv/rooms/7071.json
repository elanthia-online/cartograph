    "Deep brown wood panels this room, making it look even darker and smaller than it actually is.  A solid-looking trapdoor with heavy hinges is set into one corner of the floor, surrounded by tightly fitted grey stone.  A burned-out torch lies discarded in the corner near the trapdoor, which looks blackened and singed in places, but is still as solid as ever."
