    "A narrow walkway edges its way around the wide base of a stalagmite that rises up into the darkness.  Pale stone, almost leprously white, forms the enormous tooth, gleaming in the darkness.  Ridges and bumps, as if the stone had partially melted and then re-solidified halfway through the process, decorate the exterior of the formation.  Walls of grey-streaked ebon stone surround the tooth, like the maw of a great beast with a single fang projecting from it."
