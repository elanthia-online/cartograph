    "A fresh layer of soft straw covers the weathered oak floorboards, softening the sound of rumbling wagons as they carry their loads of fine leathers and rare furs to the back of the warehouse for storage.  Tanned hides lay stacked in piles against the smooth stone walls, waiting to be shipped to distant markets, or sold to local merchants and artisans."
