    "The sound of slowly dripping water echoes from somewhere behind the black and crimson tiles that line the chamber.  A deep black porcelain bathing-tub stands empty of water, glistening in the light of a few flickering candles set around its edges as if someone had been recently putting it to some use.  An ornate black iron incense burner emits wisps of a thick, almost overpowering fragrance."
