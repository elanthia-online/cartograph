    "Chipped and broken votive candle holders sit entombed by melted wax on a niche in the wall.  The years and elements have hardened the wax to the consistency of mortar, making the lumpy mass a permanent fixture.  The scent, probably pleasant at one time, now only adds to the cloying stench of rot."
