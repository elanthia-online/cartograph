    "Periwinkle violets wink in the golden sunlight as they mingle with the verdant ivy that encircles the stone base of the wishing well, their petals glistening with moisture.

    "Periwinkle violets wink in the silvery moonlight as they mingle with the verdant ivy that encircles the stone base of the wishing well, their petals kissed with dew from the night air.  Though the roof is missing, the arms rise from the plump body and still hold aloft a pulley that suspends a hemp-tied bucket over the glittering waters at its base."
