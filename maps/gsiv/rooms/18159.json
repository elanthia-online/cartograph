    "Ringed by a variety of splintered bone shards, a circular ivory building covers the entirety of the small island -- its surface slick and gleaming with the ghostly blue light of the surrounding torches.  A pair of arched doors leads into the structure, its surface carved with intricate designs of scrimshaw that form complex sigils that wreath the entire building in three distinct bands.  A vague rhythmic hum ripples outward from the building, its presence more felt than heard."
