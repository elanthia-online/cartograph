    "Crafted completely of glaes, the table's center contains a sunken aquarium full of creatures and plants.  Sea urchins, corals, and anemones wave slowly from the rocky bottom and sides, while tiny, colorful damsel fish and basslets dart between them.  A single starfish has attached itself to the tabletop from the bottom, splaying its legs in the general directions of the driftwood chairs placed around the remarkable display."
