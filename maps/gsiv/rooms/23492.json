    "Hanging from the ceiling are mobile lobsters, dangling like puppets ready for a show.  A large lobster-shaped display case is prominently featured, neighbored by a bowtie-wearing lobster statue.  A black shoe rack stands adjacent to a claw-shaped oak armoire.  A massive, hand-knotted lobster rug covers nearly the entirety of the oak floorboards."
