    "You are inside a very dark, smelly, cramped space.  There are rusty bolts overhead in the top of the box, and spilled food and other noxious stains are on the floor.  Looking around the edge through a gap between the box and the wall, you can see a broken, rusty chain that may have served to move this box vertically when pulled."
