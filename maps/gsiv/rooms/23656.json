    "Plum screens painted with white lotus blossoms create a protective barrier around the western and northern curve of the room, while the eastern curve is fashioned of dark green bamboo poles.  A glass-topped white rattan desk is positioned catty-corner to the room's only true corner and is arranged so that the person sitting in the rattan chair can watch both the eastern and southeastern corridors with an unhindered view."
