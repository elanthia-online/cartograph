    "Sloping gently, the terrain shifts gradually, edging into the rainforest of the mountain's foothills.  Smaller trees take the opportunity to reach upward, crowded at their bases with thick ferns.  Exotic blooms break through the greenery, splashing the plants with color.  To the south, the mountain looms, its peak shrouded in mist."
