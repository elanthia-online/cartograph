  "description": [
    "A wide outcropping of flattened stones has accumulated enough sandy soil to support the growth of vegetation.  The verdant ground cover and emerald-leafed saplings stand in stark contrast to the white, vertical face of the bordering cliff.  A heavy mist rides the air currents drifting up from the ocean surface below."
