    "Surrounded by large and small boulders, the enclosure is filled with packed dirt and edged with bushes that are laden with verdant leaves.  Small stone basins, recessed into the ground, house water for the ponderous thick-shelled tortoise that wanders around.  A cluster of dead logs leans against an enormous boulder near the rear and creates a sturdy shelter for the enclosure's ancient denizen."
