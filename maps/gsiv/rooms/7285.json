    "The air is filled with gnats.  They have swarmed in an immense cloud just off the creek, filling the air with an unpleasant hum.  You wave your hands about your head in an effort to keep stray insects off your face, but it seems to do very little good.  There is plenty of room around the gnats to continue to the west, and you could still make it into the creek around the black mass."
