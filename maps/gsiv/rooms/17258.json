    "Scenes of battle in a gilded frieze stretch along the walls, each pair of combatants cleverly arranged so that some protrusion--a spear, a raised fist--touches the ceiling.  Below the frieze and evenly spaced apart, pairs of weapons crossed over burnished shields hang on the white marble walls."
