    "Yellowed parchments peek out from underneath a collapsed column and the cabinet that once held them has been smashed to pieces.  A decorative urn has had a large chunk punched out of its body, bleeding fine-grained sand onto the floor.  A gaping hole in the eastern wall looks out onto the endless blue-grey sea."
