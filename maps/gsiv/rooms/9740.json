  "description": [
    "This spacious landing serves as a junction for twin, spiraling stairs leading up and some steep steps leading down into the misty darkness below.  The walls facing the interior of the tree here are porous with small, irregular holes allowing glimpses of the hollow area outside.  The omnipresent veins run through the floor and stairs in all sizes and configurations."
