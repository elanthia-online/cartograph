  "description": [
    "Suspended from the illuminated ceiling, a chandelier takes the form of interlocking bodies, its bronze construction salaciously emulating supple, preternaturally beautiful forms.  All of its candles burn a blanched yellow-green, casting their dancing light upon a sculpted stone arch that leads further into the temple.  The narthex continues to the east."
