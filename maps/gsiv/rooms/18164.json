    "A large niche deeply recessed into the stone walls holds a myriad of shelves, most laden with lidded jars and tightly stoppered flasks.  Next to it, a stout wooden ladder offers the obvious means to reach even the highest-stored items.  Further back into the cavernous room, numerous tall cabinets offer a glimpse of the vast stores within."
