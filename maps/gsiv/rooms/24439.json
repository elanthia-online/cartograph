    "The natural stone chamber slants upwards, opening up the area to a carved black marble keep.  Surrounding the keep are several carved rhimar sculptures, each representing a grotesque winged demon ready to take flight.  Alternating white and black marble tiles spiral outwards creating strange, rune-like patterns."
