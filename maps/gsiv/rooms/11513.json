  "description": [
    "A faint, sour odor of mildew and mold suffuses the small bedroom.  The bed linens have rotted, leaving only a thin mattress with the ticking poking through the seams.  A straight-backed chair is set near a small oak writing desk.  Heavy wooden shutters bar the two small windows, leaving the room rather dark.  A copper brazier in the corner has toppled onto its side."
