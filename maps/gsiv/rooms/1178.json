    "The trail moves through a long section of wildflowers that have taken root between the edge of the bluff and the forest.  Fireflies flit about gaily among the flowers, their colorful lights winking on and off.  Owls add to the music of nature with their calls from nearby trees, and the river below ripples as a steady undercurrent in the harmony.  The wind completes the composition by intermittently rustling the higher leaves on the trees.",

Bees flit busily from flower to flower, collecting the important materials for their hives.  Birds add to the music of nature with their calls from nearby trees, and the river below ripples as a steady undercurrent in the harmony.  The wind completes the composition by intermittently rustling the higher leaves on the trees."
