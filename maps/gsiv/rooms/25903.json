  "description": [
    "Rows of nettle trees line the perimeter of the garden, their branches full of ripe honeyberry clusters.  Benches sit along the cobblestone path as it winds through the carefully tended cultivars that lend their perfume to the air.  Wrought iron shepherd hooks placed throughout the garden hold ornate lanterns, their soft flickers complementing the moonlight that weaves through the tree branches."
