  "description": [
    "Each armchair of the pair positioned in this cozy alcove looks comfortable.  A wrought-iron stand beside each, topped with a thick beeswax candle, hints that the nook is a tidy place to find amusement or solace in a good book.  On the table, a decanter is filled with liquid, the rich golden color of a wheat field on a sunny, late-afternoon day."
