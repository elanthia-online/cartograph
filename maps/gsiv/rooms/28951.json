  "description": [
    "As busy as this kitchen is, every effort appears to have been made to keep it as tidy as possible.  All manner of herbs, vegetables and fruit sit sorted into a variety of woven baskets and bowls stacked high to the ceiling.  Uniformed cooks tend to numerous pots and pans, while stoking and feeding the fires that keep them simmering."
