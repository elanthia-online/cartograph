    "Brilliant displays of flora in methodic rows thrive in the garden, creating a quiet, soothing peace of calm and beauty.  Moonbeams shine on the surface of flat rocks serving as stepping stones and reveal deeply embedded flecks of color.  The carefully placed stones are arranged in a symmetrical pattern to allow movement through the garden without fear of trampling the delicate flowers.  Directly in the center of the garden, an oval-shaped, thick block of clear crystal encases a deep pool of water.",
    "Brilliant displays of flora in methodic rows thrive in the garden, creating a quiet, soothing peace of calm and beauty.  Iridescent flecks of color shimmer under the sunlight like shards of gems from within huge slabs of flat rocks.  The carefully placed stepping stones are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, to allow movement through the garden without fear of trampling the delicate flowers.  Directly in the center of the garden an oval-shaped, thick block of clear crystal encases a deep pool of water."
