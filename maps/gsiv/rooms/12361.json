    "A maoral desk built to giantman proportions dominates the center of the cabin, while a quilt sewn of diamonds of maroon, gold, black, and white silk covers the large bunk along the port bulkhead.  A circular, oaken table takes up the starboard third of the cabin, serving as either a chart table or for dining as needs dictate.  A single, small window in the port bulkhead and another in the starboard bulkhead are shrouded with curtains that match the quilt."
