  "description": [
    "The room looks down on a kidney-shaped pit, within rests a lethargic komodo dragon.  The massive lizard is perched on a boulder-like rock, surrounded by gravel and a small, clear-watered pool.  Occasionally a thick, forked tongue slips from the creature's wide jaws, and the reptile blinks its eyes."
