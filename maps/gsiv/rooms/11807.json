    "Mud, nothing but mud, is all around.  The dark, wet ground reflects heat and light back intensely, filling the air with cloying wetness.  Nothing grows in the mud, perhaps due to the heavy reddish tinge, indicative of intense iron deposits mixed into the soil.  It does attract one form of life in abundance, however.  Massive clouds of gnats flit back and forth across the roadway as if searching vainly for something lost.  Occasionally they find an adventurer with very uncomfortable results."
