    "A chill draft sweeps in from the dark stairwell that leads down into the stone floor at the intersection of the walls.  Precious little light reaches this corner of the hall, and the air is cool and slightly damp.  An ancient rolaren shield, its surface etched with the visage of some helmed warrior of ages past, is mounted on the inner wall."
