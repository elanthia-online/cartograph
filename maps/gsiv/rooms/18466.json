    "The meadow stretches out in all directions, left wild and green, brushed with streaks of color in the form of flowers that have taken root here and there.  So far from the town, the buildings are little more than distant shapes, unrecognizable and faint.  Amid this field of nature's creation, there is but a single man-made object, but it has been crafted in such a way as to blend with the surroundings, rather than detract from them.  Set among the blossoms and the tall grasses is a painted wooden statue."
