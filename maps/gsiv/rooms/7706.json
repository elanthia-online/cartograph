    "A few hastily placed half-rotting timbers help to support the roof, and rough chunks of stone and dirt hacked from the tunnel cover most of the floor.  A few skeletons lie on the uneven dirt floor of the low cavern, their mouths agape and a few stringy bits of dirty hair still clinging to their pale yellow crowns.  Faint rivulets of muddy water trickle steadily down the rough walls, collecting in shallow puddles that seep across the chamber floor."
