    "Located snugly behind the armory, the area is secluded enough to cause minimal disturbance.  A set of wooden stairs leads up to a raised platform, adorned with decorative banners and display cases.  A brilliant cloth banner hangs from the counter, bearing the crest of Vaalor.  A stone walkway leads back around to the thoroughfare."
