    "A large, many-tiered fountain immediately attracts attention, obviously intended as a centerpiece for the garden as it rises high into the air.  The neatly tended beds surrounding the courtyard are full of pansies and other small, brightly hued flowers.  Fancifully carved marble benches are set around the perimeter, providing a spot for visitors to rest and enjoy the display."
