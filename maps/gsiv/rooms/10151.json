    "A vast copse of tree trunks creates an impassible barrier, preempting any chance of northern progress.  The swamp bubbles at recurrent intervals, releasing putrid green gases that swirl just above the muddy ground.  Misshapen land and footprints surround a stagnant pool, the tracks look to be fresh but have no visible source."
