    "A trail winds southwest from the hillock.  To the sides, numerous stumps protrude up from the forest floor, and deep gouges in the earth indicate that felled logs may have been dragged south.  Numerous branches litter the forest floor, and the stars twinkle through the opening created by the absent trees."
