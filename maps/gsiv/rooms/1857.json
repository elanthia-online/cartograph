  "description": [
    "The broad edifice of the Kharam-Dzu library dominates this corner of the bazaar, its beams and pillars of thick timber supporting massive granite blocks mortared seamlessly top-to-bottom and end-to-end.  Wooden benches flank an arched entryway, extending to the structure's corners in either direction.  Sitting cross-legged on the cobbles, a young elven academian rests his back against the building as he peers attentively into his book."
