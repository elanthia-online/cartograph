    "The footing is uneven at the base of this hill.  Rocks and rubble litter the ground.  There was apparently a landslide here some time past.  A narrow path winds down from the top of the hill, then continues off to the west.  Saplings and undergrowth prevent you from moving off of the path, and what little light filters down through the thick foliage lies in splotchy pools on the ground."
