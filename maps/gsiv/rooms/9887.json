    "Tall, well-spaced linden trees lift their mantle of branches in an attitude of nobility and grace.  At their feet, a path winds through the boles in a haphazard course, ushered along the way by large mounds of silver-edged ferns.  An occasional boulder stands alongside the trail here and there like spectators at a parade, the stones' massive shoulders covered with lichens that look determined to outdo the ferns with their amplitude of silvery patina."
