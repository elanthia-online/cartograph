    "Reserved for larger projects, this particular stall is long and fitted with an enormous tin tub.  Wooden paddles, each baring residual traces of different dyes, are fitted into a long oak rack, which takes up the entire facing of the brick wall at the rear of the stall.  Buckets of water stand beside a small step stool set at the edge of the tub, while a series of low shelves house neatly stowed tools."
