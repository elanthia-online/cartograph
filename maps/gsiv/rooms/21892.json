    "The pavilion's soft vermillion silk walls are held up by slender ebony poles and stir with the slightest of breeze or nearby movement.  Huge, orange and yellow pillows are positioned around the area, each one placed near a small stand and bowl of fresh fruit.  You also see a beaded crimson curtain and some velvet-lined shelves."
