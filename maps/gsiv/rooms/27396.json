    "The pathway underfoot is cast in deep shadow, and the sound of buzzing insects reaches your ears.  Bright streamers decorate the lower limbs of the treees to either side, and the scent of honeysuckle is heavy in the air.  A light haze drifts through the area, rendering the entire area somewhat myopic."
