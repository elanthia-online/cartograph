    "A sphere of rainbow glaes sits within a wide green marble bowl, and cool, clear water burbles merrily out of the fountain.  Tiny pink-spotted, cream-hued toadstools and deep verdant moss encircle the fixture, the contrast in colors yet another example of the surprising attention to aesthetic detail shown throughout the guild.  Five smoothly cut openings have been created in the neighboring cavern wall, each portal curtained off by bright, embroidered canvas."
