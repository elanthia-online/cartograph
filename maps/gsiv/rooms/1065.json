    "The edges of the boulder define the direction of the trail: north and southwest.  The long, tall grass closes in against the boulder, but near the rock the grass is slightly matted down, perhaps by the travel of someone or something.  Overhead the mist glows a soft white hue in a gentle reminder that the moons still exist somewhere up there beyond the covering veil, but only a little light penetrates to the ground below.",
