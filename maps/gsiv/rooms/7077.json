    "Feeling around in the dark, you discover a cold stone altar.  It's covered with a rough, dried crust that you suspect is old blood as well as some sticky patches that appear to be fresher.  Deep grooves are cut into the surface, and you can imagine the blood pouring down during a sacrifice.  The shackles at the four corners of the altar are smooth to the touch, not rusty at all."
