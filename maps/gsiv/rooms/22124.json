    "White trellises lean against the walls to either side of the arches set into the northern and southern walls of the art gallery, while fruit trees flank the picture windows that are fashioned of tempered glass.  Enormous planters, filled with tea roses, are positioned around a stone slab that rests upon the backs of peacock statues.  The focus of the small garden is a decorative bird bath that is surrounded by blown glass hummingbird feeders."
