    "The sheer vastness of this uncharted wilderness makes determining directional locations somewhat tricky.  The sound of rushing water to the west serves as the only constant sensory clue as to current position within the dense jungle.  Tightly clustered trees ascend to the sky, blocking visual detection of the sun, and a thin mist rises above the forest floor, distorting visibility with regard to recognizable landmarks."
