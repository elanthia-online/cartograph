    "Plump cushions of viridian and ebon velvet are scattered about the small, circular space, a great many of them hugging the thick walls of crushed silk.  Here and there, a frosted globe is suspended from the ceiling, providing the area with a soft, almost intimate, illumination.  Positioned within the center of the room is an easel-supported sign of painted canvas."
