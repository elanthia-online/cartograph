    "Mountains surround you, stretching high into the bright green sky.  Before you, towering at least thirty feet into the air, is a giant snake.  It has been impaled on a pike, blood trickling down the pole and seeping into the grain of the wood.  The tip of its tail still twitches, as if its death were a recent happening."
