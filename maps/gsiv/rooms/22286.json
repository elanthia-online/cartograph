    "Long wooden tables and chairs run the length of the center of this hall, various spots still littered with old greasy plates and stains.  Stretched entirely across one whole wall is a faded tapestry depicting the image of two black towers on a field of dark green.  The sweet scent of cider wafts through from the kitchen in the back."
