    "Neatly ordered gardening tools hang on pegs along one side of this cramped room, most of which is occupied by long tables on which various flora, exotic to mundane, grows beneath rows of strangely flickering globes.  Alongside the pegs stands a wooden broom closet, while the far corner of the room is occupied by a battered desk and similarly time-worn chair."
