    "Mannequins, grouped together as though gossiping, stand in front of the window, wearing headwear and fashions designed especially for fashionable women.  An armoire, a set of hooks, a rack and a shelf are neatly stocked with some of the featured clothing in a variety of colors and sizes.  Carved into the eastern wall is an opening leading to a small alcove."
