  "description": [
    "A store of extra boards for strengthening the walls and ceilings leans against the west wall of the pocket in the tunnels.  Dirt, dust and spiderwebs cover them, and it seems that a family of marmots has built their nest in the dark spot behind them.  A variety of odd bits stick out from the rodent den, including several dead flowers and an old pair of shoelaces."
