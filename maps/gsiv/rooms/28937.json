  "description": [
    "Surrounded by a steel railing, the wagon's roof is spacious and affords a panoramic view of the Wandering Eye Market.  Positioned side-by-side, a large wastebasket and a sturdy wooden table rest along the eastern edge, the railing rising above them by several handspans.  A ladder bolted to one side provides easy egress to the cobblestones below."
