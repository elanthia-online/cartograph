    "Large bay windows to either side of the door display a variety of goods dyed with the products of this establishment.  A prismatic chandelier sheds a rainbow of light across the thick aubergine carpet.  Items of clothing in rich shades are displayed next to bottles of the dyes that brought them to that color on several glass shelves and a long display counter.  The arch to the back of the room is hung with sheer curtains in the same color as the carpet."
