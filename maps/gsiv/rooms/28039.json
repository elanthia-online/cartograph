  "description": [
    "Three shining, nearly scintillating suits of armor hang at the front of the stall, clearly meant to draw attention.  Cramped and disorderly describes much of the rest of the stall, which is tented over the top with off-white canvas stretched out over thick wooden poles.  Near the rear of the stall, just before it opens up into a set of forges bustling with activity and sound, is a worktable set with exquisitely lacquered and gilded engravings.  Pieces of metal scrap litter the floor."
