    "The sound of Archer Falls is almost deafening, its cascade visible in part through breaks in the trees.  The creek turns here, widening and picking up speed as it courses alongside the trail.  A decaying tree trunk that once blocked its path has created a tiny pool that spills over the lichen-covered wood in a silvery curtain."
