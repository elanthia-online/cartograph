    "Charcoal black sand extends the length of the beach, changing from dark and richly hued where the waves constantly lap at the granules, to lighter and dull where untouched by water.  Iron bars stuck into the ground and set with flaming torches run midway between the sea and the cliff, leading the way for those seeking to dig.  A dingy outhouse sits at the base of the cliff face flanked by a pair of lit torches set into jagged basalt.",
