  "description": [
    "A tall archway of spiral-wound twigs frames the entrance to the thriving grove.  Two ancient faewood trees stand at either side of the arch, like consecrated idols marking the path of their venerated guardian.  The trees emerge from rich layers of soil, florid with wild blooms and expanding groundcover."
