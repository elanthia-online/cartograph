    "A trapdoor is propped open, revealing a brass ladder leading down into the wagon's front room, while the flat roof has been enclosed with painted oak rails, providing a view of the surrounding marshland.  A heavy metal chest is propped open in one corner next to a large wooden rack, and a cushioned bench is pushed against the railing, with several footstools scattered around the area."
