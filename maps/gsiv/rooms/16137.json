    "A well-tended gravel path leads through the section of the cemetery bordered by white lilies.  A low, wrought iron fence runs between the edge of the bluff and the many orderly set headstones.  A riverstone marker is set by itself and surrounded by lilies.  A linden tree stands silently over several graves, including a simple white marble headstone.  Below, rivercraft pass up and down the Tempest River while moonlight reflects off the water like threads of pearl suspended in a dark night sky.",

A riverstone marker is set by itself and surrounded by lilies.  A linden tree casts its shade across several graves, including a simple white marble headstone.  Below, rivercraft pass up and down the Tempest River while sunlight reflects off the water like threads of gold suspended in a blue sky."
