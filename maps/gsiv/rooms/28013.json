    "Uneven stones, greyed with age and smooth from exposure to the mountain winds, are haphazardly stacked to form a low wall along the eastern edge of the aspen glade.  Finger-thin branches from surrounding trees interlock above to create a decorative canopy of crimson, saffron, and golden leaves, which are sparse enough to permit the golden light to slip through.  Resting to the west of the pathway is a pristine white geteld that has a triangular entry framed in interlocking emerald green embroidery.",
