    "The forecastle deck overlooks the jib-boom, which juts out of the bow with its figurehead mounted beneath it.  Catheads protrude through the railing to starboard and port, and a small pawl bitt boasts a shining brass ship's bell.  A couple of burly halflings, their trousers rolled up to the knees, wield large brooms, scrubbing the spotless deck with sand sloshed in buckets of salt water."
