    "In contrast with the niche to the south, this space appears both comfortable and pleasantly colorful, with its plush carpets and vividly embroidered tapestries.  A large, overstuffed couch adorned with silken pillows rests against one of the walls, while an elegantly set buffet table provides appetizing refreshments and further enhances the cozy atmosphere within."
