    "Round pools of stagnant water are bridged by thick oak planks, which are nearly as wide as the puddles themselves.  Twisted vines and young saplings have been braided together with colorful ribbons to create a decorative railing to either side of the walkway.  A small dirty boy stands near a pile of mud-covered pails, his bare feet playing in a large puddle of mud that flows around the base of an iron water pump."
