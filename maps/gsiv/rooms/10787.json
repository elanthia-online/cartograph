    "The faint outlines and twisting pathways of the animal run seem to terminate in a small trampled clearing.  The black oaks which dominated the run have given way to tall pines, whose fresh aroma now fills the area.  The clearing is bathed in a strange silence and a tense, semi-perceptible energy lingers in the air, as if in wait."
