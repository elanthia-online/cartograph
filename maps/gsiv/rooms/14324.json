    "Large wooden doors mark the entrance of an expansive warehouse, the crest of the Mercantylers' Guild engraved prominently upon their dark surfaces.  Only a few travelers or workmen pass by on their way in or out, their footsteps the only sound interrupting the rhythmic sound of the sea lapping at the pier."
