  "description": [
    "The icy cold, inky black water is quick-moving on top but feels sluggish underneath, bringing a langorous chill to your bones.  It is impossible to tell how deep the water is, your feet never touching the river's bottom, and the current, which is, oddly, flowing in an upstream direction, is forcing you to struggle to stay afloat.  It is too dark to make out more of your immediate surroundings."
