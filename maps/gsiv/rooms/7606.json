    "This stretch of beach is mostly rough boulders and broken rock.  The going is slow here, as you must carefully pick your way along the rounded rocks in the dark.   Here and there, huge flat slabs of rock lie where they have fallen, broken loose from above by some long forgotten storm or cataclysm.  You travel more easily along these but occasionally, one will tilt slightly as you cross it, making you guard your steps.",
