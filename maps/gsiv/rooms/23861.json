  "description": [
    "Wide branches of a beech tree support this sturdy wooden platform.  The only passage away from this area is a woven ladder of natural fibers that hangs down toward the ground far below and a single rope bridge that stretches to a platform to the southwest.  No bridge connects to the nearest platform to the north, though the span seems small enough to jump.  A small gourd attached to the tree collects rain water, and a steady dripping cadence is generated from the water that overflows."
