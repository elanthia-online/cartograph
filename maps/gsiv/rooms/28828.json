    "The plateau occupied by the small plaza comes to a jagged end toward the north and looks out into pitch darkness.  Though oppressive, the sodden blackness is not complete.  Here and there, patches of moss glowing unsettling green or striking blue reveal swathes of boggy cavern floor or other vast rock formations in the extreme distance."
