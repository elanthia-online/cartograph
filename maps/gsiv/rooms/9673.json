    "From the mouth of the aqueduct, rushing water plummets over rocks and fallen trees, dividing it as it roars down into a deep chasm.  A break in the tree canopy overhead allows several of the sun's rays to shine directly on the cascading waters.  The concentric bands of color in dazzling shades of yellow, blue, purple, and green creates the rainbow that gives the falls their name.",
