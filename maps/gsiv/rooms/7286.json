    "The ground here is quite sodden, making walking unpleasant, and your feet make squishing noises each time you take a step.  It is likely that your feet would get less wet walking in the creek, and strolling through the creek might be less messy than slogging through the mud.  A hum can be heard from the east, the sound sending a shiver down the back of your neck."
