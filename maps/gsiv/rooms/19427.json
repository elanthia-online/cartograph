    "Water flows from the tops of various rock formations to cascade down into pool after pool before eventually disappearing from sight.  A brightly burning candle floats in each pool, their flames like miniature volcanoes among the rocks.  Small baskets hang down from the windowed ceiling, each basket containing one candle of a unique shape and size.  No more than one basket candle is alight at any one time.  Steam issues from fissures in the rocks, adding a warm fog to the room."
