  "description": [
    "The heady scent of mixing essences wafts fragrantly around this section of the boutique.  Several porcelain bowls filled with crushed coloring agents line the back shelf, where a dwarven woman works mixing them.",
    "Colorful bits of powder and cream decorate the rose-embroidered linen upon the glass display, the stains creating watercolor-like designs that complement the vellum paintings along the walls.  An etched iridescent glass counter dominates the center of the area, the glass container diagonally facing a tall wood-framed mirror, both pieces decorated with an elaborate floral motif."
