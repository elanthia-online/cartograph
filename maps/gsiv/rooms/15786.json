    "A billboard proudly proclaims the grand opening of a now-closed treasure shop, its owner driven out of business by the numerous false maps sold to him, resulting in some really unhappy customers.  One of those fake maps is tacked to the sign, with some comments questioning the merchant's ancestry written in red across the face."
