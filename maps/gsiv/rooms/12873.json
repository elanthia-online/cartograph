  "description": [
    "The road continues with little notable change.  Small, thatch-roofed houses line the plots of land to the east and west, most accompanied by a small storage shed or garden.  A wooden fence has been raised before three houses along the strip, and one of its posts has been crafted to hold a single lantern."
