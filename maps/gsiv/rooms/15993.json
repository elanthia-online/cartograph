    "Massive walls of pure white granite bear numerous scars from both recent and long past assaults.  Towers stand sentinel to either side of an open modwir gate and raised portcullis, providing a suitable post for any guard.  Four flaming sconces frame the imposing entrance, and an intricate gem-inlaid crest is mounted proudly above it.  A narrow alcove near the northern tower reveals a granite staircase leading under the fortification.",
