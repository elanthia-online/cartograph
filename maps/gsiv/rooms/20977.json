    "The hills here are completely devoid of trees or other foliage that would normally provide shade or protection from the elements.  The grass and flowers are vibrantly colored and lush, seeming to thrive in the moist atmosphere.  A lone pair of giant red heliconias nearby has grown tall, standing higher than the average giantman."
