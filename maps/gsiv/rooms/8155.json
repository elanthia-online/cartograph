    "A dense hedge boasts a thick mantle of bright yellow blossoms.  It follows the road for a piece, then turns to run beside a cottage with shutters painted a shade of yellow that rivals the flowers.  Sitting on a pole anchored in the ground rests a flat platform of wood, filled with seeds and nuts.  Birds cluster around it, chirping at each other in an effort to gain control of the feast."
