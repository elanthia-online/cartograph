    "This small area houses several open-air cells.  At one time this may have been where prisoners awaited their turn to be tortured or questioned.  The cells look surprisingly well-kept and there is no evidence of rust on the bars or locks.  Bundles of fresh rope lie off to one side, while above them some keys dangle just out of reach."
