    "The large windows in the Hall's office offer a view of the moonlit garden outside.  Three desks positioned beneath serve the Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer.  Papers are heaped and scattered on their surfaces, indicating a preference for spending time in the wilds to being confined to a dreary desk.  A long cherry wood table stands in the room's center, surrounded by willow chairs, and occupying the east wall is a curious-looking hammered ora door, crafted in the shape of a standing fish.",
