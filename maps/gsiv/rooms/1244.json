    "The atmosphere in this shop is one of quiet contemplation.  The walls are covered with somber murals depicting the gods and heroes of Elanthia in their ongoing struggles against the forces of the Undead.  Racks along the walls hold gleaming weapons that seem almost to glow with an inner light of their own.  The shop's proprietor, Brother Wuldreth, attends to business with serene determination."
