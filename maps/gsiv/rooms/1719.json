    "The face of the mountain is steep, although the climb is not particularly difficult.  An abundance of protruding rocks provides ample handholds and footholds.  Occasionally a small shelf presents itself as a stopping place, but the harsh wind colliding with the mountainside makes for a rather chilly rest area.  Stones, dislodged by heavy feet, careen swiftly downward to smash noisily into the forest below."
