    "A set of ornate palm frond chairs have been set along the side wall of the shop, beneath them, a thin woven sea grass mat.  Along the opposite wall, a striking mural has been created of a sinking pirate ship, its billowing masts painted a shimmering white hue.  Tall palm trees inhabit the corners of the room, each placed in a shell-trimmed terra cotta pot."
