    "A black raven perches on the sill of a small window set high in the curved wall, its eye turned toward a curtained opening in the black stone.  A single lantern glows atop a long worktable crowded with alchemical equipment, which is covered in dust and cobwebs.  The faint odor of sulphur and burnt hair lingers in this small space."
