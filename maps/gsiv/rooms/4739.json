    "A broken cobbled path spreads out across the forest floor, half-hidden beneath creeping foliage and a thick layer of dead leaves.  In places, a few of the cobblestones are still held together by a chalk-colored mortar.  A stout cord has been tied around a nearby tree, its torn end frayed.  The sound of flowing water echoes through the woods, its source hidden within the shadows.",
