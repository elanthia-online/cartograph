    "The path continues to follow the iron fence and the gentle slope of the land makes walking here easy.  Ivy flourishes on the fence, its tendrils almost obscuring the iron pickets.  The stump of an old oak tree provides a home to family of chipmunks.",
    "The path continues to follow the iron fence and the gentle slope of the land makes walking here easy.  Ivy flourishes on the fence, its tendrils casting eerie shadows in the moonlight.  A pair of tiny eyes blink at you from the darkness of an old oak tree stump."
