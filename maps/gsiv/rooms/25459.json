    "Decorated almost entirely in shades of black, this excessively decorated tent could almost be mistaken for a funeral home.  Death masks, somber portraits, and other grim mementos clutter nearly every available wall and surface.  Only a solitary display of champagne bottles, guarded by a somber sales clerk, betrays the fact that this is a shop at all."
