    "Built to fit the interior of the tree, the room is circular in shape, with the staircase leading back downstairs in the center.  Several shelves have been cut into the walls of the shop.  Soft, verdant moss grows on the floor, giving the feel of rich carpeting.  Pale light streams in from a small opening above.",
