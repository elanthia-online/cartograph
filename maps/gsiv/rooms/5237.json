    "The hold is dark here and the walls are charred, despite the fact that the angled deck is covered nearly to the center of the room by gently lapping sea water.  Sand collects on the floor, showing how far the tide reaches daily.   Some of it has been turned to glass by great heat.  A crumbling and burnt louvered door leads to the southeast, and an open arch leads to the northwest.  To the southwest, a doorway leads to a small ladder room."
