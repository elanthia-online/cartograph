    "The northwestern wall has partially collapsed, pushing a long mound of rubble onto the floor of the tunnel and forcing passage against the southeastern side.  The subsequent constriction causes the water to race along the narrower channel before slowing considerably when the tunnel widens out to the southwest.  Shiny particles sparkle from some of the submerged rocks, indicating a possible source of mica may be nearby, but the volume apparent to the naked eye is not worth collecting."
