  "description": [
    "The landing is a convergence of two flights of stairs, where the turn of the steps has been enlarged to accommodate a large palm and a teak bench.  From a terra cotta urn standing in one corner comes the peaceful sound of bubbling water.  An arch occupies the east wall, through which one can see the upward slope of an elevated walkway."
