    "A faint trail winds through a series of indigo blue pools, each one surrounded by irregular rings of color ranging from russet to gold to brilliant white.  Here and there, deep pockets of boiling mud churn endlessly, spurting out dollops that stain the lips of rock around them brown.  The landscape is entirely devoid of plant life, other than a fringe of jungle on the far eastern edge of the flats.",
    "A faint trail winds through a series of black pools, each one surrounded by irregular rings of moonlit tone ranging from dark grey to silvery white.  Here and there, deep pockets of boiling mud churn endlessly, spurting out dollops that stain the lips of rock around them.  The landscape is entirely devoid of plant life, other than a fringe of shadowed jungle on the far eastern edge of the flats."
