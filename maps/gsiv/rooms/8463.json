    "Mountains tower to either side.  At irregular intervals rocks slide down the slopes, but how they were dislodged you cannot be certain.  The trail is obstructed by several small boulders, obviously from the mountainsides, and you fervently hope that another does not choose this moment to fall.",
    "Towering mountains blot out the stars to either side of the pass, making the darkness almost absolute.  At irregular intervals rocks slide down the slopes, but how they were dislodged you cannot be certain.  The trail is obstructed by several small boulders, obviously from the mountainsides, and you fervently hope that another does not choose this moment to fall."
