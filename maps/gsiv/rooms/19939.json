  "description": [
    "Occupying most of the room, a large bed flanked by a pair of small unusual tables sits atop a mottled moss green and tan rug, a velvet-covered bench at its foot.  A woodland mural wraps around the room and up to a vaulted ceiling.  Moonlight streams through a large circular window set high in the wall, reflecting off leaves of potted plants and giving the room an impression of a forest glade."
