    "Beams of dust-filled sunlight flow in from a small broken window high up on the wall, showering the room with a faint, pale light.  A splintered crate lays awkwardly atop a broken slab of granite.  Pieces of crushed rock partially obscure a small dented trunk.  Cracked along the frame, a stone archway leads deeper into the chamber, while a bunch of old toys are piled up to one side, forgotten in a corner."
