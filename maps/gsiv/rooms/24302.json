    "A large semi-circular bench surrounds a large fire pit in the center of the room.  A polished flared conical hood hovers above the pit from the rafters.  Thick stone pillars topped with candles stand in each corner, and intermittent shelves line the walls, displaying an assortment of odds and ends.  A well-stocked bar is flanked with an assortment of barstools."
