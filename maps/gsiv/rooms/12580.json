    "Where granite gives way to the native basalt of the mountainside, any further movement upward is blocked by a deep slash.  It sunders the peak's side in a grievous wound that penetrates so deeply, the bottom is lost in darkness.  Nothing grows on the lips of the abyss other than a few patches of moss.  Mist drifts on air currents rising from the depths, illuminated by moonlight playing over the fog's insubstantial undulations.",
