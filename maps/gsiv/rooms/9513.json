  "description": [
    "The tunnel proceeds perhaps six yards to the southeast before stopping abruptly.  Weak traces of quartz snake through the granite, but no mining appears to be going on here at the moment.  Several long, timbers lie strewn about, perhaps to be used for shoring up later excavation, and a heavy pile of rubble is heaped against the west wall.  A wide crevice yawns in the east wall, a few feet from the tunnel's end, and an unmoving waterfall of bones cascades out to the tunnel floor."
