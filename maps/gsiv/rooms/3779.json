  "description": [
    "Neatly appointed and exuding a brisk, business-like air, the office holds only a trace of the warmth given off by the fireplace in the lobby.  An octagonal display case occupies the back of the room, partially blocking the walkway to a sturdy mithril-barred door that takes up a good portion of the rear wall.  A tall apothecary desk stands parallel to the west wall."
