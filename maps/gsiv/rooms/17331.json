    "The trampled path across the courtyard leads to an enormous stone complex.  The central portion rises high above the ground and obscures the stars above the northern horizon, while the east and west wings sprawl comfortably close to the earth.  Massive double doors of carved maoral stand open and permit a glimpse of the guild house's warmly candlelit interior.",
