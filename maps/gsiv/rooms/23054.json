  "description": [
    "Thickly knotted wildrye grass stretches across the landscape and fills every available space.  Blue-green blades gentle bend back upon themselves and, despite the hardy nature of the plant, display signs of browning upon their edges.  Upon the northern edge of the area, several tufts of grass have been uprooted, their worm-knotted roots exposed to the air.  Barely visible through foliage, an opening heading north can be seen, deep muck on both sides of it."
