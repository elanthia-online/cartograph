  "description": [
    "The greenish water of the creek moves sluggishly.  The air is tinged with the primal stink of saltmarsh and ocean.  Reeds, slimy and dark, grow thick along the banks of the creek.  Tall trees, their lower creekside branches trimmed back, lean out over the banks.  Chilly wisps of fog eddy drowsily over the water."
