  "description": [
    "Large silk rugs woven with patterns of gold and white whorls cover the ground and provide a soft, yet firm, footing.  A golden oak table stands along one wall with a grey linen runner spanning its length.  Sitting flush against the far silk wall is a curved pearwood display.  An imflass chain curtain leads into the rear of the pavilion."
