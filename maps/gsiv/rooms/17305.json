    "Beneath an elegantly arched fel ceiling, a gold and crimson wyvern tapestry hangs on one of the textured red silk walls.  A carved oak table and a gold-veined black marble counter sit in opposite corners while a serene golden wyvern fountain rests on a glossy black ebonwood floor.",
    "Enclosed by textured red silk walls, the shop features a horse-mounted female statue in the center of its ebonwood floor.  A gold and crimson wyvern tapestry hangs under the arched fel ceiling.  Right near the front is a carved oak table and a gold-veined black marble counter."
