    "A crumbling stone doorway leads into the abbey's guest house, part of an old stonehold that masks the trail to the valley.  A thick stone wall hewn from massive granite blocks circles the courtyard and continues along the edge of the abbey.  To the northwest, a timber-framed building sags against the wall."
