    "The ceiling arches high over a set of three interlocking circular pools.  Light shines up from beneath the pools' churning water, sending sparkling reflections off a mosaic of crystal embedded in the stone above.  The aqua water shimmers in the light, as if trying to outdo the crystals, and glistening droplets lofted by the water's agitation dance in the air above like tiny sprites."
