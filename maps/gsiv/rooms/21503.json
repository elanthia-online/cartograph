    "A polished teak trefoil arch, carved with an overlapping leaf design, separates this room from the lodge.  The scent of smoke is heavy here, emanating from cigars left on a circular dark leather table, its surface stained with moisture from several short crystal-cut glasses sitting half-full at its center.  Five high-backed blue velvet chairs encircle the table, each seat faded from use and spills along the arms.  Various trophies dominate the walls of this room, ranging from pairs of antlers and heads of bears to oddities like handkerchiefs and locks of hair."
