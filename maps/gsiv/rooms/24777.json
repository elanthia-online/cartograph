    "Well lit and starkly furninshed, this room appears to be the perfect place to study in peace.  A single rectangular table, surrounded by plain looking chairs, sits perfectly in the middle of the room, while a giant glowing orb hangs from the ceiling, providing ample illumination.  The only other fixtures are a small storage cabinet and a single bookshelf that is populated with some light reading material."
