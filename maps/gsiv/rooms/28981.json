    "Starlight trickles in through a set of double glass doors, the silvery light pooling on the polished linden floor and illuminating the narrow hallway with its pale radiance.  White stucco walls stand opposite the entry, their dimpled faces pristine and unmarred by decoration or design.  The sound of laughter and general merriment trickles in from the northwest."
