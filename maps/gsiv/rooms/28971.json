    "Mountains of ledgers, each labeled in a tidy script, are arranged numerically in ascending order on a counter that starts just to the east of a windowed brown door and wraps completely around the room to end just west of its start.  A hurricane lantern cranked up to its highest setting emits black smoke from its top and casts brilliant white light on a tidy oak desk where a weathered old clerk sits engrossed in his records."
