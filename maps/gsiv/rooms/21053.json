    "Shimmering moonlight streams down from a star-studded sky to cover the area with a gentle light.  Fallen trees ring the area, their loss creating an opening for sweetly scented breezes to sweep through.  Various shades of green compete with vivid colors exploding up and down the trunks of trees.  Low chirrups echo through the still air, the mating call of numerous frogs accenting the low chatter of unseen animals.  Cradled by sturdy branches, a small clouded leopard lazes beneath a shelter of leaves."
