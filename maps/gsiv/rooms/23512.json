  "description": [
    "Dusky grey planks of wood form a small rowboat, though the oars seem to be completely absent from the scene.  Nearly rotted through, the bottom of the boat holds a healthy amount of putrid water, and several broken fishing wires have been carelessly tossed atop one of the plank benches.  Leading off of the entire contraption is a small gangplank."
