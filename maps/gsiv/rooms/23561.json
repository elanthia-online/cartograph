    "Rows of rhimar-edged crystal cabinets line both sides of the spacious chamber.  Encased within each are ancient but well-maintained suits of armor, their styles indicating their great age.  Hanging between the cases are royal blue banners, each embroidered with a curious, indecipherable glyph in rich golden thread.  In the center of the room stands a large gold and brass brazier, the warmth from its red-hot coals giving the chamber an almost cozy feeling despite its chilly decor."
