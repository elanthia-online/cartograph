    "This small cabin is furnished with a pair of woven blue and white rugs that cover the planked flooring.  A lacquered modwir bookshelf is pushed up against the starboard wall next to a glass wind lantern and a riveted brass port hole.  Tiny scraps of vellum partially cover the discolored portions of the floor next to an ink-stained white oak desk."
