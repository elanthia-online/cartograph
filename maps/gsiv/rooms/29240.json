  "description": [
    "A mixture of hardwoods and softwoods intermingles with verdant shrubs, thorn-laden vines, and a few hardy grasses.  Denuded stripes of yellow pulp deface the stately trunks where the antlers of large stags have stripped away swaths of protective bark.  Game trails crisscross the area, leading to and from the deeper forest."
