    "A broad stair of gigantic proportion has been carved into the face of the north wall of the huge cavern.  The gargantuan stairway trails upward, out of sight, following the wall of the cavern to the east.  The unnatural flora of the cavern ends abruptly at the edge of the stone platform that forms the landing of the great stairway.  The huge cavern that stretches out to the south is an eerie, other-worldly vista, filled with tall spires of stone and growths of giant mushrooms and huge fans of lichen."
