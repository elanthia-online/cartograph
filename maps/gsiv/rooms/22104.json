    "Painted panels adorn the music room's walls, showing scenes of woodland vistas and country lanes all blanketed with a pristine covering of snow.  Overhead, the ceiling arches into a small dome, likewise decorated with a painted firmament.  A ring of chairs sits beneath the dome, with a music stand placed before each chair.  Large cushions are arranged around the grouping, providing comfortable seating to an audience."
