    "Dark ebonwood doors are set into the southern walls, their surfaces engraved with arcing crimson designs.  Images of felines grace the surroundings nearly everywhere -- from the subtle carvings upon the columns marking the northern hall to the huge, elaborate murals upon the wall.  A faceted ruby brazier is set in the middle of the room.  Wispy grey tendrils of smoke rise from it casting a faint, odd scent to the air."
