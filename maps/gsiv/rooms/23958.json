    "[A Small Wooden Shack]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The old timbers that form the walls and floor of this shack are greyed with age, but still strong, giving the structure stability against the rushing of the river, which can be heard beneath.  Along the back wall is a low counter, several stools visible on either side, and off to the side near a wood stove is a simple oak table.  An oblong river willow basket sits atop a low counter, edged in curled green satin ribbons."
