  "description": [
    "The creek curves from the northwest to the southwest.  The barnacle-encrusted pilings of an old dock stand forlornly in the elbow of the foggy creek.  An overgrown path from the pilings wends its way northeast between two large, oddly-shaped hummocks.  Thick, thorny brambles grow in wild profusion on the hummocks.  Beyond the hummocks can be seen a knot of dilapidated wooden buildings."
