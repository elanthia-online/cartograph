  "description": [
    "The smoky illumination of a brass oil lamp reveals the hold to be a dark, dank room.  Bags of grain are stacked haphazardly against the moldy bulkheads.  A tattered notice and a slate board are affixed to one of the walls.  Against the base of the aft bulkead is a low, screened enclosure attached to a small box.  The smell of mold, mildew and rancid meat hover in the still air.",
