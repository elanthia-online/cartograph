  "description": [
    "Luxurious silk and velvet divans rest in a half-circle by a set of glass double doors.  White cedar shelves circle the room above gold-washed drawers.  Silk screens painted with golden roses upon wandering vines provide privacy in the treatment areas.  A padded table with pillows and a blanket rests beside a large white porcelain basin set atop a cabinet.  A full length tri-fold mirror with a small stool before it stands in the corner near a golden door, a dressmaker's mannequin waiting nearby."
