    "The high-ceilinged room is bright and cool with a fruity aroma.  A low haon-topped table, a brown leather sofa and two overstuffed blue chairs sit before a cozy fire in a stone fireplace.  In one corner is a neatly made bed with oaken wine casks as corner posts and an elaborately carved haon headboard depicting young maidens harvesting grapes from vines entwined about long rows of fences.  There is a small orchard in pots in front of a wide window through which streams sunlight and a pleasant breeze."
