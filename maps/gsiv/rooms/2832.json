    "The trees crowd the edge of the precipice, as if eager for a change to gaze out over the expansive horizon.  Majestic mountains rise up from deep green forests dotted with snow and caressed here and there with drifting fog and low-lying clouds.  The conifers are so thick, further passage through them is impossible."
