    "Several pieces of broken furniture are scattered on the ground, bits of wood and glass are buried in the leaves.  A group of mushrooms thrive in the rotting bottom of a splintered drawer.  The shattered glass of a large mirror reflects the moonlight back into the night.  A light wind swirls around the debris, disturbing the dead leaves.",

The shattered glass of a large mirror reflects the sunlight into prisms of color.  A light wind swirls around the debris, disturbing the dead leaves."
