    "This corner of the cavern is bigger and oddly cleaner than the rest of the catacombs.  Four stone caskets are centered in the room, intricately carved on the covers.  Long wooden torches are mounted on the walls, long burnt out.  A shattered vase lies on the floor in the center of the room on top of a painted family crest.",

Long wooden torches are mounted on the walls, long burnt out.  The brickwork between the torches differs from the surrounding masonry,indicating it has been repaired.
