    "Held in place by thick brass fixtures, a series of brass poles ranging in height and width are affixed to two of the shop's three walls and display a variety of wares designed to please the male shopper.  An enormous bay window, wreathed in green linen, stretches across the third wall and allows silvery moonlight to illuminate the shop, while the fourth wall is dominated by an enormous archway that leads to the foyer.  Several trunks housing boots and shoes are arranged beside a table heaped with hats.",
