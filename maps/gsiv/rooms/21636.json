    "Airy and spacious, this comfortable room is a fitting office for the Grandmaster.  A few papers are stacked tidily on the corner of a broad mahogany desk.  A bay window overlooks the grounds, letting in a shaft of silvery starlight.  Pulled up to the desk is a chair fit for nobility, from its velvet upholstery to its majestic size.  Behind the chair a large heraldic crest hangs, the only adornment on the otherwise plain teak paneled walls."
