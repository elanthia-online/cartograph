  "description": [
    "Brass lantern posts have been evenly set into the ground along the street and are lit to provide a little extra light.  Brick and wood shops of differing sizes and shapes flank either side of the road, their facades adorned with large display windows.  A wooden archway, sealed with a heavy, iron-bound door carved and painted to resemble a black gate, is set into the base of the hill."
