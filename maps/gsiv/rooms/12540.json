  "description": [
    "The tunnel crew drilled through to the open air above the baths in Stone Circle, letting light stream through and brighten up the cavernous neighborhood.  The surface of the roadway, although solid stone, was carved by artisans to resemble a flagstone road.  Some stones even bear swirling designs to further dress up the street."
