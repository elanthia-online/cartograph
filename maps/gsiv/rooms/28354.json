    "Dazzling moonlight streams in through a deep, narrow window cut high on the eastern wall, causing the moonstones set into the polished onyx floor to glitter and sparkle like stars against a nighttime sky.  A tall spiral staircase rises from the center of the chamber, each step inset with a single perfect white opal.  The clink of glassware and sounds of easy camraderie drift up a passageway to the southeast, and a marble arch leads down into a great chamber to the west."
