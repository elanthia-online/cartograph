  "description": [
    "A sweeping curve of tall linden trees enclose the expansive estate of a pale sandstone manor house and provide shade over its immaculate lawns and gardens.  Bordered on one side by evergreen boxwoods and several grey granite benches, a wide gravel pathway wends its way around alabaster statuary and a shallow reflecting pool, leading all the way to the semi-circular portico of the residence."
