    "At the foot of the torrential seventh waterfall, spray creates a continuous downpour, showering the imposing ferns and palms growing here and making footing uncertain on the slippery rock.  Moonlight plays off the mist generated by the moisture-laden air, a silvery haze that bathes the scene in a dream-like ambiance.  The noise of the falls is deafening, a low roar that reverberates off the stone cliffs beneath the torrent.",
    "At the foot of the torrential seventh waterfall, spray creates a continuous downpour, showering the imposing ferns and palms growing here and making footing uncertain on the slippery rock.  Rainbows waver in the moisture-laden air, appearing first one place, and then another as ocean breezes shift the spray raining down from the falls.  The noise of the falls is deafening, a low roar that reverberates off the stone cliffs beneath the torrent."
