    "The entry hall of the inn is small and stuffy, smelling as if the place hasn't been aired out in years.  A ratty tapestry covers the wall opposite the front entrance, its fabric too moth-eaten to discern what the scene upon it may have once depicted.  Raucous noise comes from behind a swinging door in the south wall."
