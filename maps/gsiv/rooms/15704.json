  "description": [
    "The chamber is circular, its high domed ceiling ridged by eight arches stretching from floor to ceiling, culminating at the roof's apex.  There, carved into the stone, hangs the body of a huge spider, its blank, multi-faceted eyes directed down at an altar occupying the center of the floor.  Within the room's lofty heights, the light is meager and fraught with thick haze that drifts overhead like slow-moving spirits."
