    "A tower of red sandstone rises above the forest in proud defiance of the trees that crowd against it.  The massive rock faces carved high on each side of the edifice direct their gaze to the black and trackless forest beyond, their enigmatic smiles and lowered eyelids revealing nothing and suggesting much.  Dark soil dusts the flagstones that lead past a pair of thick pillars and through an arch in the tower's base."
