    "The chamber's light is diffused, giving it an illusionary quality.  Sand, tinted a vivid crimson, covers the floor.  On one half of the room, fingers of green sand invade the red, while on the other, the scarlet is offset with stark white.  Two altars sit opposite each other, one white and the other red.  Statuary stands beside both altars, towering up into the shadowy heights of the chamber, while murals decorate the walls behind the sculpture."
