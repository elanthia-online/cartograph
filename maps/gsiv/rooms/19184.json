    "Hanging from the ceiling is a dimly lit chandelier which casts flickering light and long shadows over the area.  Lining the two opposing dark-paneled walls of this long, narrow space are a series of upturned hooks displaying several greataxes and naginatas, while a tall wooden weapons stand takes up the entire back wall, brandishing a neatly lettered sign and a number of smaller weapons for sale."
