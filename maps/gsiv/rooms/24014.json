    "The wide flagstone walkway opens up into an expansive plaza.  Bubbling fountains and decorative pots filled with indigenous flora mark the entrance to a massive limestone coliseum that dominates the area.  Small benches line the northern edge of the expanse, providing comfortable seating for those waiting to enjoy the spectacle."
