  "description": [
    "This expansive balcony edges the eastern portion of the house.  A low wall separates the edge of the balcony from a dizzying drop down the mountainside, where sunlight is engulfed by deep canyons filled with jagged outcroppings.  The air is brisk, and the area is empty except for an elaborate platinum stand."
