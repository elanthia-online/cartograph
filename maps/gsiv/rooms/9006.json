  "description": [
    "Large closets line the walls beside the heavy curtain leading out to the main room.  Costumes and plumage spill from the open closets in a colorful disarray.  Cluttered pine tables hold a full-length mirror against the wall, and several chorus girls chatter as they vie for a chance to check their reflection before returning to the stage.  A soft breeze from the open window ruffles a feather boa draped casually over the sill."
