  "description": [
    "The walk meanders along, its flagstones bathed in warm circles of light cast by lanterns hanging along the roof.  The aroma of brewing mead spices a comfortable breeze traveling the tunnel.  Doorways to either side of the passageway are painted in bright colors, interspersed with an attractive border of flowers carved into the stone between them."
