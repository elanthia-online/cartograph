  "description": [
    "The var comes to an end in a pleasant little cul-de-sac, framed on three sides by blue-grey marble buildings.  Several elves are taking advantage of the polished marble benches resting in the shelter of two dwarf maoral trees.  In an open window high above the var, a pale golden light illuminates some blue and silver curtains that flutter in the gentle night breeze.",

    "The var comes to an end in a little cul-de-sac, framed on three sides by white marble buildings, including the Ta'Illistim Royal Arboretum.  A dwarf maoral tree sits near the Arboretum's doorway, hung with a silver lantern and shading a low bench.",
