  "description": [
    "The tunnel ends abruptly at a sheer rock face.  Pick marks in the shapes of deep gouges and long channels mar the granite surface.  At the foot of the workface, a pile of rubble leans against the wall with chunks scattered out across the floor.  Several timbers rest against the wall, waiting to be put to use in the tunnel extension.  No work proceeds at the moment, though.  Perhaps the work crew is on break, sleeping, or has been called away to do a task elsewhere."
