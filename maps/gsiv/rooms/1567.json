    "The road climbs as it circles the base of the tower.  The massive paving blocks and fitted stone walls obviously of earlier construction than any other visible structure, including Vornavis' West Wall that rises to the east.  Although small shops and dwellings cluster about the base below, none have encroached upon this roadway that leads up to the ancient structure.",
