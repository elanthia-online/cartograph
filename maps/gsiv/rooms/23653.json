    "Orange-dyed zebra wood spreads across the floors of the foyer and branches outward towards the eastern and western corridors, while warm tangerine-hued paint decorates the bamboo-framed paper screens that form the walls.  Two screens, one on the southern wall and the other on the northern, stand wide open and allow cool moonlight to filter through the air.  Several couches and chairs are arranged in social circles throughout the area amid a plethora of palm-potted urns and lotus-filled vases."
