    "Branching out to the east and west, Sandstone Avenue provides a refuge from the busy surroundings of the mudbaths.  Signs of dwarven craftsmanship appear everywhere, from the heavy chains strung between stalagmites as fencing to the strong metal fastenings and stays on doors throughout the neighborhood.  Sharp barks echo off the walls of the houses and tunnel, originating from a rather small dog in one of the nearby yards."
