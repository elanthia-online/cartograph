    "Located on a handful of beams that are partially rotted through, the loft towers high over the unfinished barn, which glows with the light of candles and torches.  Moonlight glints off of the tendrils of spiderwebs, though much of the light is absorbed by the draping green moss that hangs all around.  From this vantage point, the loft has a sweeping view of the darkness surrounding the barn.",
    "Located on a handful of beams that are partially rotted through, the loft towers high over the unfinished barn.  Daylight suffuses the bird's nests tucked into the higher areas of the foundations, and tendrils of spiderwebs mixed with draping green moss hang all around.  From this vantage point, the loft has a sweeping view of the immediate surrounding area before large clusters of banyans block further sight."
