  "description": [
    "Curving in hairpin fashion, the street bends away from the edge of the cliff that leads to the frolicking waters of the ocean below.  Crafted in the semblance of a boat and fitted with round port hole windows, a sprawling restaurant is built along the sloping incline and supported by stilts.  An enormous wrought iron fence complements the wide courtyard that stretches before the structure, while an elegant sign is positioned before the closed wrought iron gate."
