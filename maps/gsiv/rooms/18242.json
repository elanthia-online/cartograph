  "description": [
    "Polished walls of ebonwood gleam mutely in the light from evenly spaced lit torches within the inside of the wagon.  A large arrangement of violet delphinium blossoms rests atop a low black marble table and provides a powerful musky scent that fills the space.  Arranged in a circle around the table, a group of mannequins is posed as if in the midst of conversation.  A placard rests against the delphinium-laden vase.  Ornately carved wooden slats over the windows prevent any view outside."
