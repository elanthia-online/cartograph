    "The slope grows steep here, with a long stone bench carved into the cliffside.  Loose rocks give way underfoot for those journeying to or from the large wooden dock to the west.  The wind-whipped sway of dock-bound lanterns flash swathes of light sporadically across the blackened seas, displaying only briefly the deep swells from afar, as well as the roiling white caps closing in on the rocky shore.  The surrounding towering landforms are alternately illuminated and then plunged again into darkness on the whim of the powerful breezes.",
    "The slope grows steep here, with a long stone bench carved into the cliffside.  Loose scree gives way underfoot for those journeying to or from the large wooden dock to the west.  Deep swells in the distance transition to roiling white caps closer to the rocky shore.  A steep, lichen-covered cliff face rises to one side of the narrow pathway, forming a mountain whose peak is shrouded into obscurity by a thick mantle of deep indigo fog."
