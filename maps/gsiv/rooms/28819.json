    "The northwestern curve of the plaza ends in an irregular crack where several feet of stone have been shorn violently away from the plateau.  Veins of sickly green jade gleam from the rock exposed by the break.  Past the ledge, dark wooden scaffolding has been constructed to shore up the structural instability."
