  "description": [
    "This cramped space holds a few ratty bunks.  An oil lamp swings from the ceiling and illuminates a work table where various needles and other instruments lay covered in a thin layer of dust.  Upon the walls are pictures drawn by some homesick sailor.  Some are of sea creatures and an old town, but most of them are of women.  A trapdoor above one bunk leads abovedecks."
