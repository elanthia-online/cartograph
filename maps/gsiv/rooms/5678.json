    "A pair of polished jet statues stand to either side of a massive, cloth-of-gold cushion lying unoccupied at the top of the high dais.  Similar in physical magnitude, one statue is an oversized representation of a sleek-coated housecat, while the other is a sabertoothed tiger resplendent with golden canines.  Both are adorned with gold tiaras, torcs and earrings, although the smaller statue's jewelry is set with primarily red gemstones, while the tiger's jewelry is set with a variety of blue stones."
