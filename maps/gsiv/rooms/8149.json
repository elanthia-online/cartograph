    "The alcove harbors a figure embodying the quality of action-in-repose, the figure of \"Day\".  A warrior with a face of classic beauty, he kneels on one knee, resting an arm upon the hilt of a formidable sword.  Grasped in his other hand is a scepter crowned by a snarling lion.  His visage is fierce as he gazes forward with a resolute expression in his blank, marble eyes."
