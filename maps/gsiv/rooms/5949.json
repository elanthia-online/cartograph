    "Hooked onto a mooring ring, a gig and its crew sit with shipped oars, evidently waiting for the return of an officer or the arrival of a passenger.  Seemingly oblivious to the comings and goings of people, dozens of tiny, dark green crabs scavenge along the algae-coated steps between the tide marks."
