    "Swatches of flooring materials pasted to large flat boards stand in a row against the back wall.  Each board has casters to make it easy to wheel out a sample for closer viewing.  Tiradell sits quietly at her small oak desk, reading a book and occasionally glancing disinterestedly at you before pursing her lips and returning her attention to her novel."
