    "A pile of braided lines blocks most of the southern hallway, aged but in good condition otherwise.  The smell of old, dry timbers is thick and sharp in the air.  What little illumination there is in the cramped space comes from sunlight burning through crevices and knots in the veniom-riveted planks forming the bulkheads."
