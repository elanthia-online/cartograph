    "Narrowing to an ultra thin track of solid ground, the pathway meanders through wide pools of stagnant water.  Duckweed and bladderwort create a verdant border to each of ovoid bodies and rainbow mold stretches across the stale surfaces.  Clouds of gnats thicken the air, their tiny bodies clinging to everything in their path."
