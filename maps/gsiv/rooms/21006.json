  "description": [
    "Moving along downstream, the current of the river is noticeably strong, tugging and pulling at the branches and hanging vines that hang down into it.  Several smooth grey rocks jut out of the blackened path, providing easy stepping stones through the otherwise leech-infested mud.  As if to provide handholds, bamboo stalks are intersperced alongside the path.  A strong buzzing sound emanates from all around to mix with the hypnotic sounds of the river."
