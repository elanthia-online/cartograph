  "description": [
    "Stretching high into the horizon to the east are the tall, white-capped peaks of the Dragonspine Mountains, sheer cliffs adorning the slopes like armor.  Battered cobblestones line the road, with tall buildings lining either side of the thoroughfare.  A crumbling stone wall is all that separates the town from the beginning of the mountain slopes."
