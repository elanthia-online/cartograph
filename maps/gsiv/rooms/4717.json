    "Bees fill the area, attracted to several flowering privets growing in a small clearing.  The bees buzz about furiously, collecting food for their hives.  Birds flit through the nearby trees, calling loudly to each other, and bushy-tailed squirrels scamper up and down the tree trunks as they seem to search for food or just play games with each other.  The area is alive with creatures large and small, and the occasional call of a lone wolf in the distance indicates the proximity of even larger animals.",
    "Moths fill the area, attracted to the reflections from the white flowers on several privets growing in a small clearing.  The moths flutter about furiously in seemingly random agitation.  Night birds flit through the nearby trees, diving in to capture a moth before retreating to the safety of the upper branches.  The area is alive with creatures large and small, and the occasional call of a lone wolf in the distance indicates the proximity of even larger animals."
