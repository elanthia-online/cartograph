    "Built of-a-piece, a half-timber manor house peers over its protective half-timber wall at the end of Scaup Lane.  Clearly not the most secure, with the multiple handholds and footholds that the protruding timbers provide, the manor's gate, doors and shutters -- all with obvious locks -- appear to be ironbound oak by way of compensation."
