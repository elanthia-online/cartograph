    "The low, vaulted ceiling contains a myriad of cracks and fissures, the depths of which seem to be intensified by the dim torchlight.  From time to time, a hazy shower of dust falls from some of the larger cracks, threatening to bring the rest of the ceiling down on top of you.  To the south is an expansive stone door which appears open."
