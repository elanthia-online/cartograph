    "The trail passes through an intense swath of maelstrom damage.  Intense, swirling winds uprooted ancient oak trees and snapped tall pines like twigs.  Enormous hail pelted the ground, leaving it pockmarked and nearly void of grass.  A faint ammoniac smell rises from the mass of dead and decaying vegetation that litters the ground in the twister's wake."
