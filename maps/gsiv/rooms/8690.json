    "A Wehnimer's guardsman stands before one of the graves, talking in low tones to the headstone.  As you listen, he tells a humorous story about the time he sat in the tavern and his friend poured ale on his head.  A gentle feeling of sadness washes over you as you realize that his friend now lies in the grave."
