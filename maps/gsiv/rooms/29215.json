  "description": [
    "The air is warm here with tiny wisps of steam rising from shallow pools of placid water.  Flecks of mica reflect a scintillating light across the expansive cavern, an ever-dancing light bouncing off their surfaces from burning candles housed in niches carved into the walls.  Little outside sound reaches this depth, lending an air of serenity to the visually calming space."
