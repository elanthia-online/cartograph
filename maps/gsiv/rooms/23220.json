    "Bright torches rest in polished gold sconces, casting a warm glow over the entire room.  Wide shelves line the side walls, stuffed with all manner of books along with various scribbled notes and scrolls.  An overstuffed leather couch sits before a large fireplace, giving a cozy place to rest or study.  A small rosewood altar rests before a large tapestry on the rear wall."
