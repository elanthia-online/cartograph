    "Lengths of thin netting overlap across the weathered oak planks forming the walls of the shop, the makeshift displays held aloft by tarnished silver hooks.  Some overturned wooden barrels stand scattered amongst obscure relics of the sea, the anchors and bits of driftwood entangled in strands of seaweed that have been left to dry upon the salt-stained floor.  Jammed into the chaotic mix is a carved mahogany kraken, the creature's glass-inset eyes glinting alongside the tallow candles held within its tentacles."
