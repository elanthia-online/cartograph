    "In the center of the room is a large canopy bed covered with a plush, crushed black velvet comforter with squared and rounded pillows.  On the floor before you lie several rugs made from various hides that have been sewn together with golden thread.  The walls have been covered with ancient pelts and claws.  In one corner of the room you see initials of the various warriors who once made this room their home away from home."
