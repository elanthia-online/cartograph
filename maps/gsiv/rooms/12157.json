    "A woman in a tattered shift, bound by strips of cloth and blindfolded tightly, staggers wearily up the beach.  She walks a path lined by swords, four on each side.  With each step she trips and fumbles, bouncing against the blades and cutting herself badly.  Still she staggers on, seemingly unable to find her way out of the deadly steel trail."
