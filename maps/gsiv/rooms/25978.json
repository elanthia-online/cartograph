    "[Siren Suite, Cold Bath]"

  "description": [
    "This room holds a chill as the water from the bath evaporates into the air.  No steam wafts up from the surface of the water in the rounded pool.  Benches, both underwater and against the walls, serve as seating for the room.  Oil lanterns that hang from hooks in the wall release the aroma of rain and ozone, the subtle scents giving the room an energizing ambiance.  A shelf near the curved wooden door offers its surface for bather's belongings."
