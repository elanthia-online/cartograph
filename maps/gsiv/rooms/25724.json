  "description": [
    "Violet and grey-banded umbrellas rest within the center of the white wrought iron tables that are spread throughout the small patio and are surrounded by matching chairs.  Fragrant trees line the edge of the small area and provide shelter from the persistent seaborne breeze that causes their limbs to shift and sway.  Covered with trailing pennants of white, grey, and violet, a small shack, with a long wooden counter stretched across it, offers refreshments to guests and zoo workers alike."
