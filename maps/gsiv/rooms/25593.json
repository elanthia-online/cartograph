    "A low ceiling painted in exquisite natural colors adorns this room.  A skylight set with panes of clear mica lets in the light to nurture the plants and flowers that line the panelled walls.  Several unpretentious chairs face the warm, inviting hearth of a brick fireplace in the east wall.  Against the opposite wall, a leather sofa with plump cushions beckons, a tempting spot to doze in front of the fire while contemplating esoteric matters."
