  "description": [
    "The entryway of the structure immediately opens up into a wide space.  Thick blood red carpeting streams across the floor, contrasting with the pristinely white walls, which are decorated with elaborate molding, and chandeliers dripping in black, red, and clear crystals create opulence within the spare, museum-like room.  Scattered between the various gold-inlaid display racks and stands, cushioned benches provide respite.  All but one door are shut and barred closed, and a rope hangs across the staircase leading upstairs."
