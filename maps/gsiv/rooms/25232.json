  "description": [
    "Draping down from a quartet of cracked alabaster columns are several shredded ebony raw silk banners.  Their threadbare remains are like sinewy strips of decay-blackened intestine, curling and shifting with the currents of air wheezing through the hall.  The domed ceiling above lets a few streams of light through, the rest of its surface obscured by a constant blanket of sand scraping across it from the outside."
