    "Partially obscured by an azure canvas, an old ramshackle stall lies in disrepair upon the ground amid the low scrubs and creeper vines.  Planks which have rotted, some darkened and fire damaged, are neatly piled to one side of the ruins, while the other side has fresher looking pieces of timber and smoothed planks.  Stakes, which are now mostly concealed in the ground, mark where new construction might have been planned, but the overgrown grass covering the area tells those looking that a different tale unfolded."
