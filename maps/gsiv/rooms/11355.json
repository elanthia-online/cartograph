    "As would be expected of wizards, the normal drawbridge construction is missing from the entrance to the citadel.  Traversing the ravine that surrounds the citadel is a large contraption which resembles a balance with several levers and ropes attached.  On the other side of the ravine you can see two doors which form the entrance to the citadel."
