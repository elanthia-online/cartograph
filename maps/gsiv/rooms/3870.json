    "A dragonfly hovers over the path momentarily before landing on a yellow flower growing beside the sandy trail.  A weather-beaten wood boat with a large hole in its hull sits to one side of the path, half buried in the sand.  Clumps of grass and hardy purple wildflowers have taken root, threatening to overtake what little is left of the craft.",
    "The sounds of insect life can be heard, but in the dim light here you can't see them.  A weather-beaten wood boat with a large hole in its hull sits to one side of the path, half buried in the sand.  A lantern with five or six glow worms in it has been set on the boat's hull to light the area.",
    "The soft sand of the path comes to a crossroads here with a less traveled route proceeding west and fresh footprints leading to a large sandstone building to the south.  An empty cart with a broken wheel sits off to one side of the western path, the axel propped up on a wooden crate awaiting its owner's return.  Flowerpots filled with bright yellow-leafed plants and deep green ivy fill the cart, their journey to a new home interrupted by the wheel's untimely demise."
