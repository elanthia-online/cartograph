    "Covered in leafy ivy vines, a riverstone wall runs along one side of the meditation garden, enclosing it against the inside of the monastery.  A series of five large arching stone windows gaze out onto the garden from the interior of the monastery, while simple pebbled paths encircle four small reflecting pools bordered by closely sheared emerald green grass in the shape of squares.  Worn stone slabs are nestled into the grass facing the pools."
