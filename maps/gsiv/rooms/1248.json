  "description": [
    "Once in the alcove you are surprised to see a room of quite comfortable dimensions.  A window slit looks out on the log walls of the surrounding stockade and across the choppy waters of Darkstone Bay.  A hooded cloak and a floppy-brimmed felt hat are laid out on a dressing table, and beside them are scattered some notes in an unrecognizable cipher."
