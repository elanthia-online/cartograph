    "Stark and utilitarian, this room still carries the slightest hint of fresh paint.  The walls are a neutral beige color, and the carpet underneath is only the barest shade darker.  Unobtrosive candleabras are placed in each corner, and their combined light illuminates all four corners evenly.  A series of wooden benches are arranged neatly in angled rows, each facing a small mahogany desk which sits directly beneath a frosted glass window."
