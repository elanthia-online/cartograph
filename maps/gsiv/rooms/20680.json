  "description": [
    "Thin streams of smoke drift out of a pair of marble double doors set into the eastern wall, smelling strongly of cloves.  The polished marble floor has been buffed to a mirror-like sheen, with the tiny flecks of silver within each tile glimmering under the illumation of giant toadstools.  A trio of eostones have been inlaid into the ornate lintel over the doorway to the Guildmaster's Office."
