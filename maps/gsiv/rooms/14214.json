    "A small bar takes up the end of the cabin, its top crafted of a sleek, highly-polished black marble.  Above, a large emblem bears the image of an ancient willow tree, its silhouette adding a touch of somber elegance to the area.  Several plush crimson velvet couches are placed along the sides of the cabin, and small tables for two are spaced evenly at its center."
