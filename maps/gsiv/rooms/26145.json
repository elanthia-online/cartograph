  "description": [
    "Biting winds crest the crenellation and howl through the roofless chamber causing the flames of a nearby fire to splutter and hiss.  Sitting upon the flame-wreathed logs and stones, an iron cauldron boils a sinister black liquid that fills the space with its noxious fumes.  An uneven bench occupies a space on the oak flooring that is near enough to the conflagration for warmth, but far enough for safety."
