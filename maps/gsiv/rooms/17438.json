    "Several rows of beribboned benches rest on an immaculately manicured lawn.  Running through the center of the gathering area, a small aisle leads up to a dais, which stands four steps high.  The stage is neatly tucked between towering beech trees that have colorful streamers tied to some of the lower branches.  Dark blue and thick, a swathe of fabric draped over the podium on the platform has a single star on its center embroidered in shimmering white thread.  In the distance, tiny pine trees dot the snow-capped mountains."
