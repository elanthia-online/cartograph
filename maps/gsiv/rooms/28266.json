    "[Green Marble Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The square marble table's top matches perfectly with the marble in the fifth tier of the huge fountain that looms to the southwest.  Thin golden strands course through the green marble, causing the surface to sparkle in the light.  The table's top has been buffed to a fine sheen, and the edges and supports are exactly chiseled.  An umbrella with a grey-and-green awning spreads out over the table in an attempt to shade the occupants from the sun.  A freestanding torch occupies a place near the table."
