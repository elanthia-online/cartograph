    "The broad sweep of the light pine floor is interrupted by a dusky blue cotton rug.  Halfway to the pine rafter ceiling, a fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls.  A hammered copper hanging rack and some hammered copper display hooks are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
