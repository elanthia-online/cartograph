    "Several small shops crowd along the street, which is composed of the back walls of the high buildings bordering the central square.  Each storefront vies with the others for street space and the attention of the many travellers who pass through here.  A few traders, hoping to take advantage of some late business attracted by the nearby temple, have set up stands and pushcarts filled with clothing, trinkets and souvenirs.",
