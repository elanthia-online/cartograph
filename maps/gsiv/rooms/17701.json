    "Little more than a shelf extending from the side of the Citadel, the balcony is hidden by a low wall with several arrow slits.  Metal quivers attached to the wall await arrows, while a glimpse through the arrow slits reveal the land to the east of the Citadel.  Small flares of fire come and go on the pathway below, while further away, a series of hills give way to a wide vale."
