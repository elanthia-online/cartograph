    "Placed throughout the area, several armchairs are the only indication of thoughts of comfort in the area.  Claiming a central spot on the rough plank flooring, an artfully stained wooden table is topped with an archaic conquest wheel.  An important notice is set just in front of the table, and above and behind the setup, a rules sign and a payoff chart are carved in precise detail."
