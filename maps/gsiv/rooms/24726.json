    "The dirt here is stained with a dark ruddy hue.  Small footprints leave a few trails and circles in the ground, but it appears whatever once blemished the ground happened long ago, the color of the earth having never returned to normal.  An old wooden wagon rests along the side of a dilapidated building, its wheels and sides overgrown with brush."
