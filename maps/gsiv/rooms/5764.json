    "Designed to show off the stonecutters' skill and the natural beauty of the granite, this room resembles the center of a pyramid with three triangular walls sloping to meet at a point overhead.  The stonecutters left the grey marble rough, polishing only the corners in order to accentuate the distinctive shape of the room.  A small vein of iron ore lies exposed in the floor, its surface beginning to rust in the damp air."
