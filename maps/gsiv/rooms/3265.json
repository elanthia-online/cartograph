    "Around a slight bend in the path you spot another dark opening cut into the foothill.  The remnants of an iron gate lay broken to one side of the opening set against a small, snow-covered boulder.  Pieces of iron and small rock lie scattered about as if some great force had shattered this section of the structure."
