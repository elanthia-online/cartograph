    "The massive bough of some gargantuan tree hangs in arcing tendrils to the north, completely enshrouding the hill in its leafy embrace.  A small archway appears to have formed naturally out of the dense thicket, providing the only entry into the shadow-strewn interior.  The constant current of wind that flows through the area whispers softly as it passes through the thicket of leaves, casting a mysterious feel to the air."
