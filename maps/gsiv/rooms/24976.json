    "Clearly in a state of distintegration, the catacomb's northern bank of tombs has completely crumpled, a veritable cave-in having crushed any skeletal remains.  Filling the other walls are sets of thirty-six shelf tombs, save for the western wall, which instead only has seventeen.  A collection of urns, some intact but most nothing more than broken shards, lie in a jumbled pile beneath the watchful eyes of a statue with the body of a mutilated human and the distorted head of a serpent.  Tinged with the odor of mold and decay, the air here is cold and dry, yet somehow also stuffy."
