    "At the base of Jirkirl's hill, a glade of frost-covered heather exists in stark contrast to the huge forest of aspens which surrounds it.  Trickling down from the crags of the hillock, a shallow creek of snow-melt makes its way out into the clearing, winding towards the trunks of the wood nearby.  The fading remnants of a footpath follow the tiny rivulet into the forest."
