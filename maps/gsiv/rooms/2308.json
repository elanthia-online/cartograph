    "The street ends in an ivy-covered building.  Small herb gardens grow in the window boxes, tickling your nose with pungent aromas.  A small wooden sign hangs from the roof of the building, suspended by bright gold chains twined with creeping vines.  Geckos no bigger than your little toe crawl through the vines, catching insects happily.  At the side of the shop, some empty paint buckets have been filled with dirt, and several varieties of hardy young plant grow within."
