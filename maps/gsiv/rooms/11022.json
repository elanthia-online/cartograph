  "description": [
    "The foliage is so dense that it is jungle-like.  It's difficult to determine the direction of the path.  Segmented grasses, some as tall as an adult halfling, shift and rattle with the breeze.  A slight smell of decaying vegetation filters through the air.  Giant, primitive-looking ferns grow in abundance."
