    "Tangled beards of dark green moss hang heavily from gnarled limbs, tiny forest beetles crawling within their hair-like strands.  Tall oaks shelter the ancient path from the light of the sun, blanketing the wild undergrowth in cool shadow.  A muffled chittering, similar to the jeering cry of restless squirrels, echoes through the woods.",
