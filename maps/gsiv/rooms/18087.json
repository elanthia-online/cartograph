    "Banks of candles, giving off a great deal of light but shed very little heat, illuminate a magnificent antique desk and colorful tapestries.  The bookshelves along the walls contain titles pertaining to leadership as well as magecraft, a subject especially relevant to guild masters.  A small aquarium, its vivid blue striking amidst the warm colors of its surroundings, rests atop the desk."
