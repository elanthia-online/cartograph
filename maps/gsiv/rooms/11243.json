    "An ornate carpet, moth-damaged and faded with time, covers the floor.  On the far wall hangs a vividly-colored tapestry.  The shelves of an iron etagere are filled with multi-colored glazed clay pots which still retain the stalks of long-dead plants.  Bamboo rats have nested in the once-thick down-filled mattress on the monir bed."
