    "Orderly rows of herbs and flowers line a bright white riverstone walkway that ambles between the shop and the healer's pavilion.  Filigreed eahnor lanterns suspend frosted globes along the walkway, which has benches sporadically placed among the lush flora.  A birdbath fashioned of moss green marble rests at the center of the garden beneath the cool shade of the surrounding modwir trees."
