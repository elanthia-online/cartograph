    "A cake-shaped gift box wrapped with a cherry-topped ribbon hangs on one of the polished oak walls, and a varnished golden oak ceiling rises overhead.  A brilliant red hibiscus plant sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a three-tray bakery display case with a colorful treat motif on one side of the shop and a smiling sylvan waitress statue presenting a serving tray on the other."
