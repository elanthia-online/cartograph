    "Polished black marble flooring peeks out from beneath the edges of a richly appointed ivory velvet carpet which stretches down the expanse of the hallway.  Sunlight streams from a large, opened bay window at this end of the hallway.  A collection of seashells and other gifts from the sea line the ocean blue velvet cushion beneath the window, and an ever-present hint of an ocean breeze and salty air fills the area.",
    "Polished black marble flooring peeks out from beneath the edges of a richly appointed ivory velvet carpet which stretches down the expanse of the hallway and terminates at a large, opened bay window.  Moonlight streams from the window and dances across the floor, highlighting glittering golden threading amidst the ivory.  A collection of seashells and other gifts from the sea line the ocean blue velvet cushion beneath the window, and an ever-present hint of an ocean breeze and salty air fills the area."
