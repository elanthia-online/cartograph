    "The crude, dirt-floored hut is decorated -- if it could be called decor -- with dozens of carved bones and bright feathers and primitive totems of wood, hung haphazardly from the thatched ceiling and stuck into the gaps in the walls.  A musty, stinking straw pallet rests at the back of the hut, next to a crude wooden bowl filled with some dark, reeking liquid."
