  "description": [
    "A shadowy archway in the rock wall reveals a narrow stairway that has been cut through the rock, spiraling down towards the entrance of the aviary.  Clusters of pale lavender spider lilies, their angular petals edged in a vivid amethyst, grow at the base of the archway.  Lacy networks of vines drape across the face of the rock, displaying showy white and yellow striped morning glories."
