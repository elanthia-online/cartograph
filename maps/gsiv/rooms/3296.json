    "You have entered upon what looks to be a gathering room for the upper class of this small colony.  Two large wooden tables are set parallel to one another around a large fire in the center of the room.  The fire has just been tended to and generates enough heat to warm the entire area.  Several cupboards line the far wall and hold eating utensils and primitive crockery."
