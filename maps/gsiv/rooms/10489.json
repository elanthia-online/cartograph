  "description": [
    "The rear of the barn appears as new and sturdy as any of the other sides.  A sliding door is mounted on the west end of the wall.  Paths extend through the weeds in different directions.  The path to the southwest appears well traveled, as does the path to the west.  Those to the east and southeast are somewhat more overgrown with weeds and more difficult to follow.  A large mound rises to the east, and it appears to defy the weeds that cluster around it."
