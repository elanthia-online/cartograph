    "Tiny sparks of light drift through the air, swirling up from the lower level in a lazy, multi-hued spiral to bathe the area in soft illumination.  Off to the side, a small arched window set above a narrow ledge offers a glimpse outside, and beneath the ledge is a natural niche in the wood.  The ramp underfoot continues its gradual climb upward."
