    "Even in the dim light which barely illuminates this small booth, it is impossible to miss the dense litter that covers the floor, especially around the table in the corner.  A very inept bowyer, or perhaps a very angry archer, has left behind splintered piles of what appear to have been bows of various types.  Pity."
