    "Along the northeast flank of the great earthen barrow, some loose stones and mud have washed down the slope, slashing a narrow gully through the sod and spewing detritus out onto the trail.  You detour around the debris, stepping back onto the turf.  From this perspective, you pause to get your bearings, gazing up thoughtfully at the silent, inscrutable heights."
