    "A sheet of solid rock forms one wall of this showroom, its craggy surface a stark contrast to the smoothed and packed dirt on the facing walls.  Spikes of iron have been driven into the stone to allow the suspension of colorful wool panels, lending a bit of warmth to the otherwise cool atmosphere.  A large stand covered with greaves takes up the wall opposite the passageway to the main area of the shop.  A densely woven rug of burgundy, navy, and gold pattern decorates the floor."
