    "The rising steps level into a tiled floor sheltered beneath a velarium of heavy onyx-hued fabric on a latticed metal frame.  Unable to weather the unrelenting gusts that seige colosseum at times, the cloth is badly frayed at the edges, thin strings left loose and tangled, while rents in the canopy reveal the crimson sky above.  A trio of pillars support the velarium, while the rear slants back directly into the cradle of the stone wall.  This leaves the view from three sides almost entirely unfettered."
