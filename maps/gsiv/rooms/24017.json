    "A red and white tent sits proudly along the southern edge of the flagstone walkway.  Faint streaks stain the stones leading away from the tent's entrance toward a massive limestone coliseum to the east.  A row of flowering plum trees lines the northern edge of the walk, creating a civilized barrier against the wildness of the Siren's Wood beyond.",
