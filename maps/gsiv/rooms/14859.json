  "description": [
    "Colossal ferns line both sides of the shadowy path, their waving fronds speckled and intricately scalloped.  In this part of the wood, the deciduous oaks, ash, and maples are giving way to an encroachment of pines and cypress.  A chorus of tree frogs and crickets fill the night with their raucous songs.",
