  "description": [
    "Wide red brick walkways lead up through wooden gates to intricately carved front doors on the homes in the neighborhood.  Each door on this street bears some charm for luck, ranging from a simple rabbits foot to the unusual four-leaf clover.  A family of ducks makes its home in a small pond behind one of the residences."
