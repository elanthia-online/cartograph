    "A half-moon worktable sits in this central area of the tent, and behind it is a leather-cushioned stool with a slatted wooden back.  Displays of bowstrings and arrowheads hang from the support beams in ready-reach of the worktable, and a crate sits off to one side, half full of split pieces of wood, frayed bowstrings, and other sundry items."
