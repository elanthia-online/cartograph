    "With a single gateway at the corner of Salters' Road and Trade Row, a plank walled workyard fills the northeast corner of the intersection.  A tin-roofed warehouse rises above the wall at the back of the yard.",
    "Bordered to the west by the crushing surf of Solhaven Bay, the intersection of Salters' Road and Trade Row is an expansive street lined with even cobbles.  A plank-walled workyard fills the northeast corner of the intersection, festooned with garlands of rose and lily that do little to mask the briny smell cloaking it.  A tin-roofed warehouse rises above the wall at the back of the yard."
