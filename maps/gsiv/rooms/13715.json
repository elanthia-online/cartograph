    "A wide glass skylight allows sunlight to stream liberally into the room and also provides a view of the sky overhead.  Plush, snow white carpet compresses softly underfoot, and the white matches the paint on the walls and ceiling.  The combination brilliantly illuminates the spacious walnut bed, with its purple bedspread and pillows, and the walnut chairs, with their purple padded seats and backs.  On the east wall, a brass eagle splays its wings wide, and a panoramic painting adorns the opposite wall.",
