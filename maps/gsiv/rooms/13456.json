    "A community fire pit sits at a junction of three lanes.  To the northeast and east, the arms of the road are much narrower and less defined, and they meander through a grouping of cottages.  Surrounding the fire pit is a collection of carved benches placed near -- but not too near -- the pit, which has a generous diameter of over fifteen feet.  Flower gardens have been cultivated around the whole collection, lending a serene ambiance to the buildings and their environs."
