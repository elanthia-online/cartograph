    "Long wooden planks hang from the exposed rafters of the ceiling, each with a plaque tacked to the planed surface listing the type, color, and finish used in its creation.  Along the southeastern wall, a series of cubbyholes housing a variety of receipts, paperwork, and order forms stretches from floor to ceiling, while a wide oak counter separates the open space of the shop from the recordkeeping section.  Lenny, the shop's merchant, keeps a watchful eye from behind the counter."
