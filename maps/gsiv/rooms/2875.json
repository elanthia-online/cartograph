    "A jumbled landscape of boulders stretches down toward the sound of rushing water.  Small, hardy bushes that have succeeded in conquering the chill sufficiently to produce leaves in vivid oranges and reds add color to the bleak terrain, growing among the rocks with aplomb as if it were an easy feat.  Through a light fog, the shadows of spruce trees extend ragged arms out like sleep-walkers."
