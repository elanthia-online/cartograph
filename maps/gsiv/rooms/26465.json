  "description": [
    "Brightly glowing lanterns frame a few crooked stone steps that lead up into the main shop and do little to dispel the general gloom in the corners of this somewhat tidy room.  Four tables displaying armor, weapons, arcane items, and miscellaneous treasures are arranged neatly, but these are the only things new about the space.  The heavy, musty odors of age, mildew, and water damage fill the air."
