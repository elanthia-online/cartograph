    "The trunks of two living oaks make up the south corners of the irregularly shaped niche.  Expertly cut slabs of wood make up the walls between the trees, and a fresh breeze from the forest wafts in through the paneless windows, the scents of moss and fresh leaves blending with the aromas of strong ale and roasted meat from the bar and serving table along one wall."
