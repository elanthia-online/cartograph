    "Rivulets trickle across the sloping ground of the swamp in a crosshatch pattern that leads from the higher tree-line toward the sludge-filled watercourse.  Gelatinous globs of bright orange mold spores spread in the thick mud between the faintly running water, which is pockmarked with globs of clear slime.  Several clusters of hardy swamp grass rise up from the landscape, their dark roots preventing them from being carried downstream."
