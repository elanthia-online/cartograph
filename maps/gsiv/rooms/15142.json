    "Each of the comfortably cushioned seats has an excellent view of the large stage that is the focal point of this room.  Niches along the cream-colored walls are draped with rich gold damask curtains, and the red carpet laid over the oak parquet floor leads to a stage and its nearby podium.  The low ceilings allow even those seated in the back row to hear the performances.",
