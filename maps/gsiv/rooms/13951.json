    "Moss green and bright white walls flutter gently in the river-borne breeze that flows freely through the raised platform room.  Comfortable cots, set with light blankets and soft silk pillows, line the structure's two permanent walls, while a third is set at the back near a canvas wall bound to faenor anchors.  Rafters stretch between the walls and dangle dozens of frosted globes over the entire room providing it with constant illumination, while a tightly woven canvas and silk canopy stretches above it."
