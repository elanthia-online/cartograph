    "A long counter extends from the south wall nearly to the north wall, splitting the room neatly in half.  Two large stone pots, one on either side of the counter, house luminescent toadstools, their glowing caps providing ample light by which to conduct trade.  Behind the counter a serious dwarf goes about the business of repairing lockpicks and stoically helping customers.  A metal work table abuts the west wall, behind the counter, and a sign resides on the counter."
