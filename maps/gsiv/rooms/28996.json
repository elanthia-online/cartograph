  "description": [
    "A deep ocean green carpet runner bisects the lobby, cutting an even divide between the check-in counter that sits to one side and an arch-inset wall on the other.  The end of the counter rounds to a gated entrance just short of the far wall, and a recessed staircase sits just beyond, leading to the second floor of the inn.  On the facing wall is a pastoral mural that spans from end to end in muted shades of grey and blue softened further by the diffuse light cast from the candle-lit lanterns overhead."
