    "This slightly shabby annex of the baker's shop is clean and cheerful, in spite of the well-worn look of the oak tables and parlor chairs here.  Faded checkered cloths cover the tables, and tattered doilies in turn cover holes and stains in the cloths.  The comforting smells of baking bread, fresh sweet rolls, and brewing herbs mingle in the air, imparting a sense of calm and familiarity.  It is a welcome change from the struggles of life in town and in the wilds surrounding it."
