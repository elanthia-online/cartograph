    "A little circle of huts have collapsed inward on themselves, leaning together for support like a group of their owners in a drunken stupor.  Around them, a twisted octopus of metal extends its tentacles.  The strange conglomeration of metal debris at first appears to be some hellish sculpture, but closer inspection, by sight and smell, suggests it is an animal cage."
