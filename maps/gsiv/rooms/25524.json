    "Swirling with tendrils of impenetrable vapor, the moon limned on the walls is so dark as to be nearly black, but bathed in a grim aura whose shade lies at the darkest vagaries of violet.  Far in the distance behind it, almost eclipsed by the moon's bulk, is another sphere that is but a small swirl of green and blue.  Laid out before the murals is a wide bed of black velvet."
