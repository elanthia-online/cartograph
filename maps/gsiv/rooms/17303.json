    "Pale amber spidersilk curtains frame a row of diamond-shaped windows.  In front of each window stands a uniformed mannequin, jauntily sporting the crimson and gold of the Vaalor military.  The mannequins stand at attention, each clutching a different musical instrument between its fingers, the overall effect resembling a drill band lined up for a parade.  The merchant Ambra stands behind a long thanot counter edged in mithglin, on top of which is a small sign."
