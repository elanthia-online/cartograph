  "description": [
    "A cloistered lane leads to a foliated yett, its ornate leafwork reflective of the young trees that shelter the way, and painted a deep sage green in an attempt to blend in.  Beyond the gate is a small quadrangle of chevroned gold and white bricks fronting a domed white marble temple.  Moonlight is seemingly absorbed by stonework that glows with a ghostly lunar pale, and flickering torchlight illuminating the entrance is reflected in the metallic accents.",
