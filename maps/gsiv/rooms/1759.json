    "The eastern DragonSpine Mountains loom closely.  Their peaks march off to the south and northeast.  The peaks have very little snow cover, and the mountainsides are practically devoid of snow.  The wind's general direction is from east to west, and when a rare cloud does make an appearance it is quickly shuttled over to the western side of the valley.  To the northeast, though, the valley's floor is covered with a blanket of white."
