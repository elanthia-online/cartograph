    "Giant black marble lions with snarling visages resting on solid silver blocks flank the blackened cobblestones.  At the base of one of the pedestals is a tiny green lizard stalking a small brown bug.  The sea breeze purrs through the area rustling the leaves of the willow trees almost musically.  A yellow marble chateau with black ora trim rises up majestically behind the leonine statues."
