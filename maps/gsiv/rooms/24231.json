    "A hearth sits across from the door with a large cauldron bubbling over the embers of a fire.  An aroma of swamp, overcooked vegetation, and boiling meat emanates from the pot and fills the room.  A chair and small table sit at the foot of a dilapidated cot over in one corner of the room, leaving the rest of the small space open and clear.  The dirt floor shows signs, like a game trail in the woods, of crossing the room showing the occupants' usual paths."
