    "Beneath an exposed pine rafter ceiling, a sphere-hilted mounted sword plaque hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls.  A gold-leafed mistwood cabinet and a Vornavian silk-lined display case sit in opposite corners while a dusky blue cotton rug rests on a water-stained light pine floor."
