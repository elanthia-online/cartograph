    "The sounds of a soft breeze and the cries of seagulls carry through a large archway, providing a touch of serenity to the abandoned tower.  A wide track of water leads from the arch to the center of the room where it ends in a puddle.  The small puddle appears to be a recent addition to the tower as there are no signs of a water ring around its edge.  The entry hall narrows to the west."
