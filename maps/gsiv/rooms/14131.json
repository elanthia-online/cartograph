    "Dominating the room is a multi-tiered ivory dais channeled with a fluted marble colonnade and ornately gilt capitals.  Small beams of sunlight stream through the panes of stained glass windows that are inset into the gabled ceiling.  Lying in the center of the room, a round tasseled carpet portrays a golden scroll in the center of a silvery mist.",
