    "The grass in this garden is tall and full, occasionally trodden at the edges of the path.  Wildflowers grow in several places amidst the grass and you even see a single cherry tree growing next to the fence.  Moonlight adds silvery highlights to the water spraying from the intricately carved marble fountain.",
