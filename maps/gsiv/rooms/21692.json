    "Surrounded by thick wooden walls, a tall black obelisk marks the entrance to this small outpost.  At the center of the camp stands the King's Bane Saloon, overlooking a small, glistening pond.  To the east several flags on a pole dance in the wind above the Onyx Griffin Trading Post near a wide war wagon.  The eastern area is dominated by a series of tall stables."
