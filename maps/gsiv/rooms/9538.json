    "A single, conical stalagmite thrusts up through the sea of bones in the center of the room.  The space between the walls has narrowed considerably and it is a tight squeeze between the stalagmite and the walls.  To make matters worse, the closeness of the room has intensified the stench of decay, making breathing difficult."
