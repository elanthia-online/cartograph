    "A small sign proclaims in bright letters that this is the home of Wurt the Amulet Maker.  A small gravel pathway leads through a wrought-iron gate to the tall double doors of the house.  The windows of the house are shuttered, but periodically a burst of light shines through their wooden slats and illuminates the entire street."
