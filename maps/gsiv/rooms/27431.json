    "Stuffy and slightly cramped, this space is filled with the smell of frying food.  A crackling fire burns within a round-bodied cast iron stove, the constant heat radiating from it causing the air to be heavy and moist.  A scarred wooden table is pushed up against one wall, the battered surface covered with knives and other cooking utensils.  Tucked into an out of the way corner is a roughly hewn stone wash basin with a chipped rim.  Tiny tufts of shed hair are just visible scattered across the wooden floor."
