    "The solemn surroundings are more befitting the priests and priestesses who dedicate every hour of their lives to the temple, than a mere trespassing worshipper.  Lit with several oil lamps set in iron sconces, rows of onyx benches stand in a circle around a central altar.  Steel grey vestments chased with crimson-threaded flames hang from several hooks along the walls.  Three arched openings lead to smaller alcoves off the main chamber.",
