    "A raised island sits in the middle of a sunken granite ring, and a granite stairway rises from the center of the ring to a room above.  From the marks all along the sunken ring, it appears that people descended the stairway from above in order to draw water from a sunken ring pool.  Once-colorful frescoes, now faded and cracked, adorn the walls above the outside edge of the pool."
