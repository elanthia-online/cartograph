    "Creating a narrow maze through this stretch of swamp, a dense stand of pond cypress trees dominates both the land and water areas.  Low-lying grasses cling to the available shore, their growth stunted by the overhead moss-hung branches that create a living ceiling.  Taking cover in the lack of light, dark shadows flit to-and-fro, noiseless and ephemeral in their flight.",
