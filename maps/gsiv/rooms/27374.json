    "Lit by a huge wrought iron chandelier, the stone walls of this spartan chamber are lined with evenly spaced cresset-cast sconces.  Prominent and center, a great wooden table stands, completed by matching low-backed wooden chairs.  At the far end of the chamber, a huge iron-framed slate hangs opposite a vast imperial chart, and between them sits the long wooden desk of the Adjudicator of the Order, somberly at the head of the chamber.  Ravens flit in a gilded cage next to lancet windows behind the desk."
