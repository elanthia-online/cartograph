    "Hanging from the walls are masks great and small, the products of a rough but talented hand.  To a one, they are possessed of a primal, terrible beauty, looking like living creatures of vibrant lacquer and ornamental wood.  Talismans dangle from the ceiling from braided lengths of hair, catgut, and leather, ranging from corroded coins to tiny skulls and bundles of bones."
