    "The broad sweep of the plank floor is interrupted by a worn rug.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the smooth granite walls.  A half-open bloodstained iron maiden full of long rusty spikes and a glass-topped mistwood counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
