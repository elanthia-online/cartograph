    "Not wider than a hallway, a glass-topped weapons display case takes up most of the available space in this cramped section of the wagon.  Several upturned hooks dot the wall above the case, paired into sets to hold weapons parallel to the ground.  Sconces holding flickering candles separate each pair of hooks, casting dancing light over the metallic blades."
