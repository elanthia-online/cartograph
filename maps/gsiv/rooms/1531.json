  "description": [
    "The paving stones of the Circle spread outward, covering the ground right up to the Beacon Ring's retaining wall that rises southwest of the road.  Helpfully, a low stone fence marks the boundaries of the blacksmith's yard, separating that domain from the roadway, but giving the impression that the space was fenced off long ago and the blacksmith's tenancy is a relatively recent occurrence.  The blacksmith's forge and anvil stand idle beneath the night sky.",

A low stone fence marks the boundaries of the blacksmith's yard, separating her domain from the roadway, but giving the impression that the space was fenced off long ago and the blacksmith's tenancy is a relatively recent occurrence.  Working intently at her anvil, she hammers away at an andiron, carefully heating, hammering and then quenching the metal."
