    "Toppled, cracked, and empty fire pots line the base of the eastern wall below a tattered tapestry, creating a solemn memorial to the more prosperous days of the temple.  The floor of the western portion of the hallway, seen through the debris that has been piled in the archway along the wall, has completely collapsed, and is replaced only by the crashing sounds of the waves below."
