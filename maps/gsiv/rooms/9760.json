  "description": [
    "As the incline nears its head, it slants sharply upward and narrows.  The footing deteriorates as indentations and bulges in the wood become more pronounced.  A cloud of floating motes adds a distracting factor to the peril of the walkway, as they spiral and flicker in dizzy flight around the chasm at the tree's heart."
