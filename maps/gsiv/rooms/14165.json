    "A large window bordered with crimson eahnor allows an unfettered view of the surroundings on nearly all sides - the massive bow of the ship being directly in front of you.  A large pattern is inscribed upon the mute grey wood of the deck, the contours of the silver coalescing into an arcane design.  A semi-circle of comfortable velvet cushions surrounds a translucent dome set into the center of the design, its surface humming faintly with power."
