    "Modest attempts have been made to make this place seem upscale:  Swathes of red velvet are hung with silver nails as a ceiling border, and a pair of iron candelabrum are bolted to the floor to either side of the giant, red velvet davenport.  The burning candles help counter the lingering fish smells."
