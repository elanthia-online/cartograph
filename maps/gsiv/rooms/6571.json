  "description": [
    "This circular chamber is littered with the broken bones of its former furnishings.  No big surprise there.  One thing is distinctive though -- the stench here could knock an orc on its back.  That and the cold.  Every breath exhaled here frosts the air into a white fog.  No wind is stealing in to account for it, a fierce, dead cold that permeates the warmest garment.  A staircase winds up to the floor above."
