    "You can occasionally hear the rustle of movement through the underbrush.  There is an abundance of small game throughout this forest.  A professional hunter could make a good living here.",
    "The nighttime forest is quiet, devoid of the wildlife that must romp here during the day.  An occasional rustle in the underbrush startles you, leaving you to wonder what kind of creature might roam the darkness around you."
