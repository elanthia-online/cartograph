    "Exposed oak rafters line the ceiling and house large crates adorned with packing labels written in various tongues.  Resting at an angle over a low counter is a wide rung ladder, its hooked end binding it to track upon one of the rafters.  A low bookshelf is set behind the counter holding journals and neatly stacked shipping documents.  Dusty windows set to either side of the entryway allow a bit of sunlight to stream into the room.",
    "Exposed oak rafters line the ceiling, their depths shrouded in inky blackness.  Resting at an angle over a low counter is a wide rung ladder, its hooked end binding it to track upon one of the rafters.  The low bookshelf that is set behind the counter houses a small brass lamp, which illuminates some journals and neatly stacked shipping documents that rest upon its shelves.  Dusty windows set to either side of the entryway allow a bit of moonlight to stream into the room."
