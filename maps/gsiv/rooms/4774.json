    "Wide beams of light stream down through gaping holes in the wooden walls, illuminating a large chamber nearly covered with a thick layer of dust, dead leaves and other debris.  A stout birch pole rises up from the floor to the ceiling in the center of the room and from hooks along its sides dangle a half dozen cord leashes.  An animal musk hangs heavy in the still air, and numerous paw prints crisscross the dusty floor.",
