    "Off the beaten path and slightly seedy, the alley is dark and cool.  An occasional voice drifts down the alley from the southwest and a few folks wander by.  Set off to one side of the path is a small shabby shop sporting a sign, which hangs by one hinge and squeaks whenever a stray breeze happens by.  Facing you is what appears to be the back door of a well kept building.  At the end of the alley is a large building with a sign hanging over its large double doors."
