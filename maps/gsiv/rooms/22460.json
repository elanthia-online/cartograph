    "A large glass window takes up an entire wall of the shop, moonlight gleaming through and shining on a length of shelves where numerous miniatures have been setup for display.  Two glass-paneled cabinets hang on both sides of a wide lacquered door, while the center of the room is occupied by a huge ironwood table.  A high archway is set behind a curved maoral counter where two faded copper bins rest to the side."
