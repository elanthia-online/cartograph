  "description": [
    "Here at the foot of the towering mainmast sits a halfling clad only in a loincloth of dingy white cotton.  Thick piles of wood shavings lie scattered all around him as he focuses on the task of carving complex patterns into the wood of a nearby coffin.  Occasionally, he traces his small fingers over the intricate designs and smiles to himself."
