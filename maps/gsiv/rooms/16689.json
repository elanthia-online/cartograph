    "Thick sandstone pillars rise from the sandy floor at selected intervals, supporting the weight of the heavy terra cotta roof.  The shop wares are displayed proudly along the dark-stained walls that frame the room and have also been hung randomly along the pillars.  From the ceiling hang hollow bamboo wind chimes which jingle harmoniously when the ocean air blows in from a rounded window on the far wall.  Next to the window, a cotton tapestry has been placed, displaying the crest of Four Winds Isle."
