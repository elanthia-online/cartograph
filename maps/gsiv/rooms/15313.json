    "Mahogany paneled walls rise from a dark-stained oak floor.  Just above a carved ebonwood dinghy hangs a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry, and a vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A vine-carved mahogany table and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
