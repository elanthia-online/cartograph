    "A few sugar maples seem to be an abnormal shade of grey, perhaps stressed by lack of good soil or competition for nutrients from other nearby trees.  The normally dark leaves have slipped into various shades of light grey, making the trees appear as billowing ghostly cones against the dark backdrop of the rest of the forest.  A few scattered leaves lie under the trees, their appearance once again taking on a much darker color.",
    "A few sugar maples have changed color, perhaps stressed by lack of good soil or competition for nutrients from other nearby trees.  The green leaves have slipped into shades of flaming red, deep orange and bright yellow, making the trees appear as billowing cones of flame against the deep green backdrop of the rest of the forest.  A few scattered leaves lie under the trees, their colors fading to a murky brown."
