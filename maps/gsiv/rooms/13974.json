  "description": [
    "A huge mirror hangs behind the well-stocked cherry bar that runs the length of the rear wall of this ornately decorated room.  Over the bar is a modwir sign etched with mithril inlaid letters reading \"Girvahk's.\"  Comfortable chairs and floor throws are scattered about in small clusters, perfect for sitting and relaxing.  A fire crackles merrily in a large stone fireplace opposite the bar."
