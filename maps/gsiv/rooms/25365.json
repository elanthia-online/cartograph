  "description": [
    "A painted wood-carved plaque hung above the entry proclaims this space to be, \"The Ballroom.\"  Instead of a wide-open floor for dancing, the entire room is packed full of brightly colored balls.  Large ones, small ones, and a few so tiny they appear more like pebbles, cover the entirety of the wood paneled floor.  Two floor-to-ceiling windows have cracked and broken panes, marking where play apparently went out of control."
