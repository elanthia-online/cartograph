    "Tall marble pillars stand along the west side of the hallway, along a small open area that forms the center of the temple.  There is no obvious access to the open area, but you can see that it is tiled with crystal squares alternating with silver ones, and an elaborate onyx bench sits in the center, as though for a privileged someone to sit and stargaze in the evenings."
