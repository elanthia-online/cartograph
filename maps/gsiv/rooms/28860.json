  "description": [
    "A fortune in copper has been forged into a wide disc that rises over the rest of the chancel. At its center stands an altar of deep green jade, its surface patterned with whorls of stylized smoke.  Tentacles strain from the stone of the altar as if to embrace a supplicant before it, their muscular forms covered with dozens of ghastly suckers.  A single copper step descends back to the nave."
