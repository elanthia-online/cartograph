    "A single white light slowly appears in front of you several yards into the thick fog accompanied by a barely audible buzzing.  It stays consistently just ahead of you, partially hidden by the mists.  The light moves up and down rhythmically, always keeping the same distance, stopping when you stop, moving faster away when you accelerate.  After a few minutes it suddenly winks out, the buzzing stops, and the area returns to its quiet solitude."
