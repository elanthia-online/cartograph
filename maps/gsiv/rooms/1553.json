    "Cradled by the salt-laden flow of the Sunderer's Glaive, the peninsula is lifted above the water by craggy banks of bone-white stone.  A trio of townhouses roofed in red tile are surrounded by mosaic walls of granite enclosing the tiny court.  Freshly whitewashed and bearing polished brass lanterns beside each door, their bright decor counters the shadows and close confines of the little enclave."
