    "A soft glow of candlelight casts shadows throughout the room, blurring the lines between reality and illusion.  An intricately carved oak bed dominates one wall, piled with midnight blue and grey silk pillows.  Across the room, a deep grey chaise lounge sits invitingly next to a small oak table."
