    "Vines drape from the high granite wall that disappears into the sky, the stone's dark face and towering height looming ominously over the small village.  Cracked barrels, discarded wagon wheels, and piles of warped boards lie broken upon the ground and display signs of long exposure to water and other elements.  Cracked coral, dried-out seaweed, and tangles of kelp rest in huge piles throughout the area, the strange aquatic flora looking out of place in the jungle-like foliage."
