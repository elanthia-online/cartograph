    "Several gouges mar the walls on either side of the cramped passageway, deep enough to fit a giantman's arm within.  Pale lichen festoons the small ledges upon the scarred earth, trailing toward the floor in thin waves.  A few shattered bones lie beneath the fungus, each obscured by the fuzzy grey-green tendrils."
