  "description": [
    "The creek bed tapers off here into an indistinguishable part of the landscape, its banks having crumbled and collapsed into mild slopes leading up out of the ravine.  Scrubby trees encroach upon the sandy floor of the gulch, and all hope of safe onward travel is ruled out by a series of vague and dubious tracks through the undergrowth."
