    "Thick underbrush and craggy rocks cover the steep slope down into the ravine, cleared out in narrow paths leading to residences nestled into narrow ledges and outcroppings.  Golden light filters through the tall modwirs that take root on the stony slope, sparkling on a small stream that trickles below."
