  "description": [
    "This corridor is quiet, and the decorations here are minimal.  A soft carpet woven with several hues of complementary springtime shades matches the sage green silk covering the walls.  An oak door stands between a pair of triple-pronged candelabrum affixed to the walls, and opposite is a pale yellow glaes door."
