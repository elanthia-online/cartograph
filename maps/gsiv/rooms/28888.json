    "Railings hug the curve of the road to the south, protecting passersby from a perilous drop to the beach below, while dormant lanterns line the opposing side and reflect the sunlight in every direction.  A shepherd's crook supports a swaying sign at the edge of a small pathway that leads from the cobblestoned slope through a lush, cultivated lawn towards a small shop."
