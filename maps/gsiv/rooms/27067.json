    "Chalky cobblestones are all that remain of a building, boulder-sized pieces resembling a child's collection of building blocks that have toppled into the moss-blanketed earth.  Game trails wend their way through ravaged threads of civilization and are shadowed by beech trees to the south.  Tangled vines and twining carob trees form a wall of foliage that is parted by a leafy vine-covered arch.  Thick thorny bramble grows through a dilapidated wain, imprisoning the wagon to the environment."
