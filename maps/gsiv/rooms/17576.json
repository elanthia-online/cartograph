  "description": [
    "Stark and lacking in decor, the canvas walls of the immense stall are a pristine, clean white, and the area immediately opens out into the courtyard.  In the center of the stall, a fragrant, lithe faewood tree rises up out of the blue ceramic tile flooring.  The tree's permanent presence is further embellished by the elaborately worked bamboo and glaes table that neatly surrounds the tree, where the grey-tinged trunk grows right up through the center of the table."
