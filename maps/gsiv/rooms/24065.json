    "Enclosed on the southern end and open to columned views of the peristyle to the north, a sunken pool is ringed with blue tiles featuring rampant unicorns and graduated star mosaics on the bottom, forming various constellations.  Gossamer panels create a veil of privacy for the various lounging chairs placed around the perimeter.  Rosewood-barreled citrus trees thrive in the humidity, adding their intoxicating fragrance to the scent of lavender oil in the wall lamps."
