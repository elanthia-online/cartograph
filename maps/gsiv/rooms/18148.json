    "A pair of silver lanterns hangs from the blue-lacquered wooden ceiling, suspended on matching argent chains.  Below is a neatly arranged mistwood desk with silver-gilt cabriole legs and a polished labradorite top.  A carved wooden screen, inlaid with a strutting peacock, separates the reception area from a larger space, filled with less impressive desks, that are visible behind it."
