    "Rough walls of dark rock surround you to create a small chamber, darkness enshrouding the area like a haze.  Faint light can be glimpsed further north in the cramped tunnel, flickering amidst the blackness.  The air is slightly damp, the silence of the area being broken by the quiet sound of water dripping far off in the distance."
