    "Overcrowded with barrels, hogsheads and casks of varying sizes, the dim interior of this shop could almost be a cooper's showroom, but for the almost medicinal aroma of strong spirits.  With no room for a counter, Lem Skinker rests patiently on a barrel, a basket of blown glaes bottles and flasks on one side and a sack of corks on the other."
