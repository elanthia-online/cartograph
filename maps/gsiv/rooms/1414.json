  "description": [
    "Following the northern bank of the river as it heads east, the caravan trail quickly leaves the settled fields and pastures behind.  The trail and the ancient, piled stone markers that pierce the river's surface are soon the only signs that intelligent life has passed this way before.  To the west, the trail appears more used as it follows the Cairnfang towards the cliffs above Solhaven Bay."
