    "Elven archers in the livery of Vaalor stand astride an enormous marble arch.  Their arrows target a bilious green airship, but each is vaporized by a dull grey beam before reaching its target.  Below the aerial combat, hordes of animated orcs spew forth from a dark cavern, engaging in a vicious battle with two-headed centaurs defending a hillock of ice topped by an obsidian plinth."
