    "The crash of glass falling against stone startles you, making your heart pound against your ribcage.  A wooden column braces the wall, the pilaster carved with symbols that are now indecipherable.  A pair of faded ribbons dangles from the column, and a pile of dead flowers rests at your feet, likely fallen from the restraining ribbons."
