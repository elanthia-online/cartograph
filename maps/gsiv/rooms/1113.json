    "The stream is barely a trickle, a couple feet wide at best in places, narrowing to a few inches at others.  It is no more than a few inches deep on the average.  However, it is enough to keep the grove of trees and the interspersed wildflowers alive and vibrant.  Lush grasses grow near the stream's bank, and the water appears clear and drinkable.  The soft grass and fragrant wildflowers provide a peaceful place in which to take a snooze, if one is so inclined."
