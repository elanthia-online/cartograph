  "description": [
    "Striped with metal and gem inlays, the inner sanctum of the shop is even more ostentatious than the outside.  Swirling patterns of jaspers and agates are nearly lost in the glitter of faceted stones caught in the bright lantern light.  Some shaggy furred cushions in a jarring mix of styles and colors are scattered about the wagon, divided by a plum-hued runner that leads from the entry to the prize wheel itself.  A gleaming platinum stand edged in alternating bands of colored enamel inlay displays a pair of ornate silver boxes to one side of the wheel, and a gem-encrusted stone pedestal stands on the other."
