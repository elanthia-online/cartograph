  "description": [
    "Crooked fractures and vein-like lines, the result of constant weathering and the stress of time, split the facade of smooth stone, creating jigsaw patterns on the rock walls.  Sparse grass and other small clusters of vegetation cling to the creases, their hungry roots pulling a meager existence from the tiny patches of sand and sediment trapped in the irregular surface."
