    "Overhead, catkins sway gently on a barely palpable breeze from about half a dozen willow trees that encircle the perimeter of the patio.  From the center of the trees, gurgling sounds are clearly heard originating from a large fountain.  Water chestnuts float serenely on the water's surface, and their nutlike fruit along with many silver coins litter the bottom of the basin.  In no particular pattern, tables and chairs made of sturdy bamboo are scattered under the willow trees."
