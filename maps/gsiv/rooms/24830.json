  "description": [
    "The icy cold, inky black water is quick-moving on top but feels sluggish underneath, bringing a langorous chill to your bones.  It is impossible to tell how deep the water is, your feet never touching the river's bottom.  Sending you careening about, the current swirls in two different directions, one continuing upstream, the other branching off to one side, where a pale glow emanates from below the water, the outline of a grate vaguely visible in the otherwise nearly pitch black."
