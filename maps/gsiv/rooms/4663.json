    "Plaster and stone walls remain unadorned, along with the majority of the room.  Though vacant, the shop is meticulously clean and nary a speck of dust can be found.  A bejeweled brass bin is tucked behind a smooth granite counter, prominently displaying a catalog of wares.  Warm light shines through a narrow oak archway draped in pale blue fabric.",

A catalog of wares is prominently displayed upon a smooth granite counter, open for perusal and to facilitate the delivery of orders from the curtained-off backroom."
