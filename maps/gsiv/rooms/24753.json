  "description": [
    "Paneled in sheets of mithril alloy, this room is of such large proportions only a giant could find it cozy.  One wall is dominated by three immense portraits, with a plaque below.  Against the opposite wall you see a simple executioner's axe lying cradled upon a shrine to Leya.  A wingback chair and footstool scaled to accommodate a gigantic frame sit beside a heavy alloy tower shield supported by three axes turned blade down."
