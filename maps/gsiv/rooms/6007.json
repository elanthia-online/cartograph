    "Its crooked branches reaching upward toward the moonlit sky, a gnarled old oak tree stands at the edge of the gently sloping hill, like a lone sentinel watching over the grasslands and overgrown fields below.  A large axe with a crude stone head has been forcefully imbedded into the side of the black oak, its twisted ironwood haft protruding outward from the tree.",
    "Its crooked branches reaching upward toward the moonlit sky, a gnarled old oak tree stands at the edge of the gently sloping hill, like a lone sentinel watching over the grasslands and overgrown fields below.  The bark of the ancient tree is dark in color and heavily ridged, almost appearing like deep wrinkles along its trunk.  A large axe with a crude stone head has been forcefully imbedded into the side of the black oak, its twisted ironwood haft protruding outward from the tree.",
