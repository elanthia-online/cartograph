    "Soft aquamarine curtains frame the glaesine-paned windows of the herb shop.  Whitewashed haon shelves line the walls, each shelf carefully stocked with a variety of glaes bottles.  A long monir counter, well worn and apparently used as a worktable, rests in the center of the shop.",
    "Whitewashed haon shelves line the walls of this room, each shelf carefully stocked with a variety of glaes bottles, bandages, herbs, and other healing supplies.  Elven nurses flow around and behind a long monir counter, well-worn and apparently used as a worktable, that rests in the center of the room.  An open doorway to the west leads to the infirmary, and a black-inked sign rests upon the far wall."
