  "description": [
    "A barrage of sweet-smelling chocolate, candy, and other goodies assaults the senses as their scents fill the air of the quaint but simple confectionary.  Crystal shelves stacked with glass jars in a variety of shapes and colors line the walls.  The pale light of the moon, accompanied by several multicolored handblown globed lanterns, creates a dazzling array of colors across the floor.  A glass counter stands to the left of a small alcove.",

Sunlight streams through the windows, and creates a rainbow of colors upon the floor as it strikes the glass jars.  A glass counter stands to the left of a small alcove."
