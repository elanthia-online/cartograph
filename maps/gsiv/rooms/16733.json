    "Two stone columns stand side by side on the edge of a precipice, marking the termination of a broken road through the grassy area.  From between the two columns, a stone bridge extends outward only a few feet before ending abruptly into an empty space, offering only a view of deep gorge with a thin blue ribbon of a river at the bottom.  Tied to the base of one column is a thick hemp rope leading downward, which disappears over the edge of the precipice."
