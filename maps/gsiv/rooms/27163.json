    "Two tiers of niches encircle the curved walls of the sewer, the upper tier housing softly glowing stones and the lower filled with avian skulls, while beneath are copper pipes draped with grey fabric.  Sloping slightly, the floor is curved in a bowl-like shape with a shallow dip that culminates in an iron-gated drain.  Marble benches encircle the space and use the stones of the walls as their backing."
