    "Spick and span, the kitchen is well-stocked with various baking paraphernalia, all organized in handily placed cabinets and wicker baskets, several of which are attached to the bright yellow walls.  Situated adjacent a swinging door and an open hearth, a spacious grey stone counter provides substantial ingredient preparation and dough-rolling space, and a wide chalkboard spans the wall above it.  Two large ovens and an oddly shaped machine share the back wall, opposite a basin, some wooden buckets, and a stone case of midding size.",
