  "description": [
    "The streets are oddly silent, certainly much too quiet with the sun halfway through its daily journey.  Visible in the distance, occasional villagers stride along the streets,  their pace hurried and with purpose.  Other than a few squirrels darting from tree to tree, the huge park to the west sits unused."
