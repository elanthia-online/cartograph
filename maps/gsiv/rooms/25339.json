  "description": [
    "The canvas walls of the wagon have been waterproofed by painstaking oiling, though they also hold in the dank, humid air.  The floor is formed by a huge rectangular box filled with about two feet of gooey mud.  Shelves and hooks hang suspended from the roof supports, bearing the shop's wares.  The legs of a a sturdy wooden table stained with water rings are stuck deep in the mud near a narrow closet door, and a canvas tarpaulin leads to the rear of the wagon."
