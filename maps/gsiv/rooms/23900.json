    "In the deeper interior of the tree a cozy nook has been carved out, and the rough wood that forms the walls has been smoothed and polished to a faint luster.  Pine needles have been woven together to form a roughshod rug upon the floor.  A leafy curtain hangs down from the ceiling across the passage leading back out."
