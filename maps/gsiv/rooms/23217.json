    "Roses of every color bloom beneath a crystal dome, forming an elegant border for the rows of herbs being tended by a halfling gardener.  Lilies, jasmine and lavender create an ordered riot of pastel around a circular stone path.  In the center of the path stands a bubbling font of pristine melt-water, its quiet sound a peaceful counterpoint to the garden's stillness.",
    "Roses of every color bloom beneath a crystal dome, forming an elegant border for long rows of winterberries being tended by a halfling gardener.  Lilies, jasmine and lavender create an ordered riot of pastel hues around a circular stone path dotted with several white-washed wrought iron tables and matching cushion-padded chairs.  In the center of the path stands a bubbling font of pristine melt-water, its quiet sound a peaceful counterpoint to the garden's stillness."
