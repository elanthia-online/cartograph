    "The white plaster interior is richly draped with gold brocaded satin and near the entry is a tall golden stand.  The darkly stained wooden floor is covered in a variety of crimson and grey wool runners.  In the center of the room is a massive plush crimson davenport and near the perimeter are a few elegantly carved wooden benches."
