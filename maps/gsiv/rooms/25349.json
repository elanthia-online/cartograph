  "description": [
    "Brass lanterns line the stone walls casting a dim light through the barroom.  Stale cigar smoke lingers in the air, mixing with the scent of strong spirits.  A polished oak bar runs the length of the room, offering a few refreshments to weary travelers.  Behind the bar hangs a thick burgundy velvet curtain that covers the doorway to a backroom."
