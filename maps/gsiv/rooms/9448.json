    "The foyer of the brewery flares out to the north, a smooth granite archway inset into the far wall, opening up into a large room filled with detailed informational signs and notices.  A length of braided white cordon winds its way throughout the area, serving as a way to direct the flow of visitors.  In the center of the room, a large chunk of bluerock rises up from the floor, its jagged contours resembling a form of primitive art."
