  "description": [
    "Moist heat descends down in thick waves.  Countless bamboo stalks and large growths of foliage wall off the dense jungle to one side of a barely visible pathway of footprints cutting across the jungle.  On the other side of the path, several browned figures move in and out of open-faced huts, though a thin draping of ferns, which hangs down from several taller trees, blocks any clear view."
