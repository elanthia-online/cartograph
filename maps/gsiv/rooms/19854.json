    "Muted light streams in from the large windows set into one wall, illuminating the intricate pattern etched into the stone walls.  The long graceful stems of orchids have been painstakingly carved into the soft marble, each delicate blossom rendered in striking detail.  A marble workbench sits directly in front of the windows, its surface scratched from use and bearing an amethyst glass alembic.  A granite crucible sits within reach of the workbench, the dark stone striking against all of the pale marble."
