    "Polished mahogany planks create a pleasant contrast to the vividly-hued hunting and feasting themed tapestries mounted on the walls.  One tapestry nearly covers the entirety of a narrow portal.  Discreet glass-shaded lanterns provide a constant, if flickering, illumination to appreciate the woven details.  Set in the middle of the otherwise empty floor is a brass-trimmed box with a display boot resting upon it."
