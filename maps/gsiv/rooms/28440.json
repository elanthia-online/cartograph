    "The ceiling in this area is far overhead, making the already large room appear that much more spacious.  Dominating the center of the floor is an elaborate fountain, crafted of intertwined onyx and white marble, and depicting a mighty demon ensnared by tendrils emanating from the outstretched hands of a sorceror.  The water bends and bows in spellbinding patterns, leaping across the structure and cascading down towards a shallow pool.",
