  "description": [
    "Soft, cream-colored carpets cover polished floors beneath opposing velvet settees near the entry.  The curtains are drawn over shuttered windows, the only light flickering from tiny candles set within a large candelabra resting on a rosewood dressing table placed in front of a filigree mirror.  On the far wall, a pale linden armoire detailed with floral-patterned cloisonne stands open, partially concealing an opening leading further into the wagon."
