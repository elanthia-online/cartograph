    "Warmly lit, the shop is littered with wood scraps, most hidden under thick drifts of sawdust.  A wood stove fills one corner, its metal black as night.  A tool bench is filled with a wide assortment of saws, hammers and other tools.  A shelf, fitted with small bins, holds nails and other fasteners.",
    "Warmly lit, the shop is cozy and smells of fresh coffee.  Several mugs sit atop a wood stove, that fills one corner, its metal black as night.  A mistwood counter is filled with a wide assortment of flavorings and accessories.  A shelf, fitted with small bins, holds several packets of coffee."
