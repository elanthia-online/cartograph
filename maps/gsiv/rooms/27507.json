    "The walls of the shack are striped in thick black and red panels, and a long, low shelf runs the length of the one opposite the entrance.  The floor is littered with remnants of cork, and discarded peanut shells crunch underfoot.  An oversized dart board adorned with dull bronze numbers is painted on the paneling."
