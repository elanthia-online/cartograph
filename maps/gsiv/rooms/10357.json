    "The cobbled path winds its way amongst a backdrop of flourishing gardens and lush vegetation.  Light yellow sandalwood has been carved into intricate latticework, allowing slender, leaf-tipped vines to reach toward the glimmering sun.  Delicate pink and bright yellow petals bloom from the tendrils, providing brilliant decoration for the wooden frames.",
    "The cobbled path winds its way amongst a backdrop of flourishing gardens and lush vegetation.  Pale sandalwood has been carved into intricate latticework, allowing slender, leaf-tipped vines to reach toward the dark heavens overhead.  Delicate buds adorn the tendrils, providing berry-like decoration for the wooden frames."
