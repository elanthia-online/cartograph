    "Thick stalks of bamboo rise up to pierce the canopy, creating a thick and near impenetrable wooden wall.  Long curare vines cling to the bamboo, climbing up to the jungle ceiling above.  The vines' furry green leaves weave the upper branches together tightly, dimming further any light that might penetrate through the dampening mist."
