    "Old netting is draped around the entire booth, looped onto iron hooks every few feet that also hold small lanterns.  Underneath, amid the shadows and soft lighting, sits a sturdy haon table and matching chairs scattered around it.  A swordfish is mounted on the back wall, taking the entire width of the booth."
