    "Riotous brushwoods tangle about one another, creating a tightly packed section of vegetation.  Moonlight is rare here; the foliage meshes far above, the leafy blanket holding in the warmth accumulated throughout the day.  Even with the shadows of night, the air still retains a heavy, humid heat that is only slightly relieved by the few breezes that pass through the area.  Flourishing in the oppressive climate, hundreds of plants grow to extraordinary sizes, giving the rainforest a primitive atmosphere."
