    "The area just inside the wooden doors is grand, replete with large tapestries lining the walls, decorative columns topped with fearsome gargoyle statues, and brightly burning chandeliers dangling from the ceiling.  Every surface is formed of the same uniformly black stones which vary widely in size.  The resulting uneven texture produces an odd stillness as the normal reverberations of sound are greatly muffled."
