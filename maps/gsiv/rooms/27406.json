    "Dancing flames leap high into the air above a massive roaring bonfire, contained at the edge with a ring of small black stones, and filled with piles of painted effigies constructed of straw and wood.  Violent pops from the crackling blaze launch showers of sparks spinning into the air above.  Another outer ring of larger smooth black stones encircles the inferno providing comfortable places to rest and observe the spectacle as carnival goers come and go."
