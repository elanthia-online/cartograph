    "Beneath an elegantly arched fel ceiling, a gold and crimson wyvern tapestry hangs on one of the grey watered silk walls.  A gold-veined black marble counter and an elegantly carved oak armoire sit in opposite corners while a serene golden wyvern fountain rests on a glossy black ebonwood floor."
