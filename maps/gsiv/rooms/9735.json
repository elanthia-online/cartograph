    "Warm mist drifts from tiny orifices across the roof of the landing, making the floors and walls bead with condensation.  Larger droplets gather on odd-looking protrusions and eventually fall to puddles on the floor with a soft *PLOP*.  A fog-shrouded corridor slopes up to the northwest, while to the east, a small alcove lies behind some hanging, root-like tendrils.  A steep spiral stair circles down to the east."
