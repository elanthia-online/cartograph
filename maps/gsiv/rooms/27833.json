  "description": [
    "The massive tree is long since dead, but the hollowed-out interior is filled with a magical life of its own.  Moisture seeping through the cracks and branches has formed a fairyland of icicles that reflect every color of the rainbow, and a colony of glittering snow sprites has taken up residence among the lacy icework, their gossamer wings shimmering as they dance among the lattices of ice and the hanging branches that drape the entrance."
