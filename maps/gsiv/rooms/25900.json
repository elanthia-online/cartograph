  "description": [
    "Curved, panelled walls enclose the spacious parlor, broken only by a banded wooden door.  The large upholstered furniture gives the room a permanent, solid feel, while the oversized stone fireplace provides warmth and ambiance, both day and night.  Recessed shelving holds hundreds, perhaps thousands, of books, and the windows are covered by heavy brocade drapes."
