    "A luxurious velvet-covered bench rests in front of a rather odd looking machine here.  Three cylinders painted with various images spin madly whenever the chain attached to the machine is pulled, eventually coming to a stop in seemingly random patterns.  Crystal lamps sit to either side of the machine, illuminating it brightly."
