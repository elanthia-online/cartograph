    "Four hanging moons of colored glass hang from the overhead, lit from within to cast their commingled light on the shop foyer.  Statues, one pale and one dark, guard a trio of arches that lead off to the north, south, and east.  One of them holds a burning stick of incense, the heavy scent of which thickens the air."
