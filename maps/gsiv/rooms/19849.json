    "A steady hum resonates through the torch-lit avenue of columns, fed by the murmurs of students and masters as they talk along the open-air walk.  Glimpses of the gardens beyond can be seen from within the gallery, echoes of the lush foliage that lines the street and breaks up the paleness of stone.  At either side of the walkway, a path branches off leading to specialized training areas."
