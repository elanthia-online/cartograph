    "Cobwebs hang from the water-damaged ceiling of the tavern, which has partially collapsed.  Puddles of filthy water and mud are scattered across the floorboards, each brimming with life that floats upon their surface.  The bartop is covered in several layers of dust, with the abandoned bottles of alcohol barely visible underneath it."
