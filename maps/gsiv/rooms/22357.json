    "Striated with veins of crimson, the smooth alabaster walls are bare with the exception of the marbled coloring.  A rich, obsidian velvet carpet woven with golden whorls covers the floor.  The only furniture in the sparsely decorated antechamber is a pair of marble benches, placed to either side of a pewter-banded ebonwood door."
