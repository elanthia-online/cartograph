    "Interrupted by the staircase, a wrought iron railing runs the entire length on the upper level of the gallery.  The sullen glow of the moon creates a rainbow of cascading colors, as it peeks through the iridescent domed skylight above.  An amazing collection of masks and armets hang on metal pegs that protrude from the walls.",
