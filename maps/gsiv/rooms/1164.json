    "A large patch of wild raspberries stands just off the west side of the trail.  The plants cascade all over, and a wealth of berries are clustered on the extensive bushes.  Two things keep travelers from enjoying the succulent fruit.  First, the plants also sport sharp thorns that happily puncture and tear any flesh that tries to slide past them.  Second, all the berries don't seem to be quite ripe enough, and where ripe ones might have been there are none.  There are bear tracks here."
