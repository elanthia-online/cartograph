    "A jagged, flat-topped boulder rests in the shadow of a massive, gnarled oak, its lichen-etched surface covered by a layer of crawling vines that cling to the stone like a nest of sleeping serpents.  Black and purple shards of moss hang from the branches above, dangling their ethereal fingers over the path."
