  "description": [
    "This small room has seemingly nothing terribly remarkable about it other than the lack of light and decoration.  The exceedingly low ceilings are the primary feature of the room, detracting from the pile of rags in the corner that seems to function as a bed and the pattern of runes on the floor.  Nearly hidden in the shadows is a tiny wooden door."
