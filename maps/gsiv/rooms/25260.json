    "Suspended from the ceiling are a series of stained bronze hooks.  Their gleaming chains creak slightly from the hot wind whistling through a rend in the sandstone walls.  Caged lanterns line the walkway leading up to a scaled bronze door, the deep viridian flames held within washing the chamber in a flickering dance of ethereal light."
