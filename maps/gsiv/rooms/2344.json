    "This room is perfectly spherical, like the inside of a crystal ball, except for the circular, sandstone-paved floor.  Rather than the depthless blue of glacial ice, these walls reveal a seascape of sand, coral, and waving beds of kelp surrounding you on each side.  A small school of herring can be seen swimming here and there, not only behind the walls but overhead as well."
