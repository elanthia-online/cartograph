  "description": [
    "The cobblestone walk veers toward the pond, following it so closely, one misstep will leave the unwary pedestrian ankle-deep in pond water.  A cottage sits on pilings sunk into the pond's mud floor, its gardens composed of water lilies.  Raised stones offer a walkway to the cottage's round door.  Baskets of blooming jasmine hang from the eaves, spicing the air with exotic perfume."
