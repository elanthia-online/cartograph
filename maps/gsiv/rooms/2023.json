    "As the path passes beneath an arch created by an immense fig root, the darkness crowds in and the atmosphere is heavy with the smell of organic debris.  In a shadowed crevice, mushrooms grow, their spotted caps luminescent in the moonlight.  They stand jauntily, like a small army of soldiers dressed in brightly-colored heraldic garb.",

In a shadowed crevice, mushrooms grow, their caps spotted and tinted a bright vermilion red.  They stand jauntily, like a small army of soldiers dressed in brightly-colored heraldic garb."
