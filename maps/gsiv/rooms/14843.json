    "It is impossible not to notice that the ankle-high grass in this small garden is greener than that on the other side of the fence.  Dozens of wildflowers of countless varieties cover the ground to both sides of the path.  Creeping vines of ivy cover the polished silver gate and a large, intricately carved marble fountain stands directly in front of you."
