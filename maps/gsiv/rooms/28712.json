    "Dingy walls rise upon the eastern and western sides of the room, their thick cobblestone faces devoid of window or furnishing, while the joining walls are made of rough oak slabs.  Crates and boxes, each labeled with rough slate and chalk signs, are pushed back from the open flooring to provide easy passage between a long iron and wood counter and a copper-bound door that leads to the alleyway beyond.  A pair of enormous wrought iron candelabras are positioned to provide the best possible light to the cramped space."
