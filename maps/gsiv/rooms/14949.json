    "A quaint cobbled road is bordered by a fieldstone wall and cabins spaced along its way.  Generous poplar trees shade the thoroughfare, and lush yew bushes edge its perimeter.  On either side, the cabins are shingled with slate tiles.  The buildings are well-fashioned and tidy, and project a prosperous image."
