    "A large, well-dressed adult troll stands in front of a long black slate mounted on the east wall, alternately marking on it with a piece of chalk and gesturing at the group of young trolls gathered on benches in front of it.  Two doors lead out of this austere room, one north and one south.  A spacious cage resides in the northeast corner with a cramped cage beside it.  Moonlight streams in from large windows covered with opaque white strips of metal hung in a series.  Silence pervades the area."
