    "Beyond the arch separating narthex from nave, the ceilings slope upward.  Far above, they glisten with ostentatious displays of copper leaf and inlaid jade, creating the illusion of swirls of green smoke against a reddish background.  A musky odor mingles with the cloying smoke leaking from countless censers along the walls."
