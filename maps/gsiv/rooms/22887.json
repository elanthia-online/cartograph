    "Stretched between the dark bodies of two leafless, black willow trees is a dust-riddled cobweb riddled with cocooned insect bodies.  Leaves and small twigs are also bound in the thickly corded structure, the organic debris displaying signs of severe rotting.  Discarded insect carcasses litter the soggy pathway, which has a sporadic placement of heavy boulders jutting up through the mud."
