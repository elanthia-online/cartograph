  "description": [
    "A narrow, shallow channel filled with the lively burble of flowing water forms a small stream that winds its way through the tall stone spires, creating a twisted line that cuts across the center of the cavern from west to east.  The thick moss that grows along the banks of the miniature river gives off a sweet, but slightly fetid odor.  Small lizards watch you with reptilian stoicism before darting off to hide among the rocks and fungi."
