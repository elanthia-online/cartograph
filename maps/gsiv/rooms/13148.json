    "Heavy footsteps can be heard, echoing off the polished stone floor, from the many branching halls within the building.  Low murmurs of conversation occasionally arise, though the participants remain unseen.  A grand mural has been rendered in bas-relief upon the inner wall, depicting the battle of Sunfist in magnificent detail."
