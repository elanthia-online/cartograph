    "A stone walkway weaves its way from the nearby pond and comes to an end at the foot of a large herb garden.  A narrow stone path loops around the garden, with several beds of herbs and flowers surrounding the outer perimeter.  At each corner of the garden, nestled within the plants, is an elegant marble fountain.  Inside the looping path and standing at the center of the garden is a towering faewood tree.  A trio of wooden statues stand at the base of the tree and are surrounded by numerous tiny flowers."
