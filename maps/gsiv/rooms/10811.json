    "Smooth sandstone walls rise from a weathered cobblestone floor.  Just above a small potted boxwood shrub hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a paneled haon ceiling completes the picture.  A gold-trimmed ebonwood chest and an ora-bound large walnut trunk stand side by side in the middle of the room."
