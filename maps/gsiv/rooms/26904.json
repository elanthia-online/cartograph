    "Mingled scents of tanik and cedar fill the air as dense fir trees crowd the remains of the cobblestone and dirt road, which ends abruptly at the dark waters of a wide river.  A dilapidated wooden dock appears to have rotted away almost entirely, while nearby a few benches sit near the stone wall amidst the remnants of an abandoned card game."
