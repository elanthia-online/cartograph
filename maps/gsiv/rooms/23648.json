    "The broad sweep of the planked floor is interrupted by a worn rug.  Halfway to the arched ebonwood ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the weathered ebonwood plank walls.  A vultite weapon rack formed of stylized waves and a worn ebonwood counter with a deep viridian silk runner are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
