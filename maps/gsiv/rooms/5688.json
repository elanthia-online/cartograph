    "A white painted rail runs around a narrow walkway that extends along the roof of the Rest.  A wonderful view of the entire bay and its busy wharves is available from here.  To the north, the Market Bridge crosses the bay toward Marshtown.  Just to the southwest the North Haven and Charl's Piers jut out into the bay."
