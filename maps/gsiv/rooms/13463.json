    "A steep flight of stone steps has been chiseled out of the bluff's rough face.  Carved handrails line each side of the steps' course, making the precipitous assent less hazardous.  Dogwood trees can be seen growing throughout the surrounding forest, their white flowers vivid in the forest canopy's shadows.",
