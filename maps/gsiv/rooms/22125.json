    "Partially covered, the polished linden floor shows at the edges of a cerulean carpet.  Several unique doors of different sizes and colors line the walls.  A small stream of water trickles down a rock formation built against the wall, patches of moss covering smooth stones in the basin.  A small marble fairy stands to one side, gazing at the waterfall."
