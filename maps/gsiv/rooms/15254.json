    "A multihued Vornavian silk tapestry hangs on one of the polished oak walls, and a mosaic tiled ceiling rises overhead.  A tiny carved stone tree sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a beveled glass-covered case on one side of the shop and a long carved oak counter on the other."
