    "The pile of bones peaks, flowing away to the east, south and northwest.  Barely decomposed troll bodies lie atop heavily decomposed troll bodies, and some bodies have rolled far down the mountain of bones regardless of their state.  The wind's soft whistling reaches your ears from somewhere far above, its source lost in the inky blackness of the cavern's roof.  The stench of rotting flesh assails your nostrils, and, although breathing is not difficult, it is rather unpleasant."
