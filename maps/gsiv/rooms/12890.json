  "description": [
    "Some scorched and barren spots of land where an occasional fireball has found its mark dot the landscape.  Like searching fingers, tendrils of smoke from the fire-damaged apple trees and a pile of charred clothing drift lazily in the air.  In the center of the orchard, a circular patch of land holds a badly scarred oak table not far from an odd-looking contraption made of clear glaes.  Three individuals are seated comfortably within the lava cistern."
