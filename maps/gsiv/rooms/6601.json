    "This octagonal tower has the narrow windows especially suited to archers.  A splendid view of the lake and the sheer walls of the cliffs protecting the castle's back can be had from the more easterly of the windows.  The sound of waves slapping against the cliffs is carried in on the wind, making the chamber seem very close to the water's swell."
