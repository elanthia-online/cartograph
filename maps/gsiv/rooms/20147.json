  "description": [
    "This sparsely furnished section of the wagon has been partitioned off by a darkly varnished panelled wall interrupted only by a silver-framed blue wooden door.  A simple wooden bench rests against the wall underneath the three tall, rectangular windows beside a small round wooden table.  The shape of the windows causes long, blocky shadows to be cast across the floor, punctuated by stripes of pale moonlight."
