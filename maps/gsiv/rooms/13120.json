    "Arranged to be the most effective in storage, the armory houses a bounty of weapons, armors, and shields in a variety of styles and sizes.  Each is neatly stored upon high or low shelves dependant upon the race the pieces were designed for, while a series of dusty oak work benches set in the center of the room holds polishing, mending, and etching kits that are at the disposal of any to use.  High above, brightly burning orbs are anchored to the ceiling within wrought iron cages, and a door that leads to the corridor beyond."
