    "A trio of simple carved pillars support the low ceiling of the main entryway of the store.  Hanging from the far wall is a tanned rolton hide tapestry depicting a fierce battle between a dwarven brigade and a horde of trolls.  A motley assortment of rugs covers up the floor, subduing the stone's chill and muffling footfalls."
