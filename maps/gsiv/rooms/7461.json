  "description": [
    "A peculiar smell permeates the area, irritating your nose and eyes.  The odor is not strong and has no discernible source, but it leaves a bitter, foul taste in the back of your mouth.  The reek only adds to the general feeling of discomfort in the narrow confines of the tunnel."
