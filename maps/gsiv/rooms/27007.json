  "description": [
    "Reddish light mingles with purples and greens as the twin nebulas that rise to the north dominate the horizon, their bright lights strong enough to overtake the hue of the energy field of the protective dome.  Gently humming sounds herald a pulse of energy as the dome ripples with arcane power.  Dimpled craters are scattered just beyond the edge of the golden walkway, though only one is outlined in red-glass tiles and has a set of stairs leading to it."
