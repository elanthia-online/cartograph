    "Rows of basket-covered shelves line the walls of this efficient kitchen.  A wide stone sink sits in an island counter of pristine marble, providing the means to prepare a variety of foods.  Shiny brass hooks hang above the center island, boasting a variety of cooking vessels and utensils.  Standing next to the door is a wooden rack, stacked high with polished serving dishes."
