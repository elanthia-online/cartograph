  "description": [
    "An immense, seamless slab of polished white granite with rust-colored inclusions forms the primary horizontal work surface for this utilitarian room.  A line of wooden horse heads with painted eyes and carved flowing manes rests upon the worktable.  Pull-toy dogs and donkeys are joined by pull-toy giraffes and sloths, all awaiting a final sanding.  Collapsed on the floor is a carved maple boy, joints splayed out with metallic springs."
