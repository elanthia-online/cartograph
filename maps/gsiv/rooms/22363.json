    "An installation of spalted maple sunbursts arcs across the high-reaching limestone walls, coalescing at the center of the ceiling in an elegantly layered, hanging sculptural piece.  Directly beneath the ligneous structure is a round, low-set rowan meeting table encircled by yellow-orange damask cushions."
