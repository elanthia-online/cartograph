    "Moonlight silvers the leaves of vines that press against the artistically pierced teakwood shutters of the windows that line the hall.  The sound of dripping liquid echoes from somewhere nearby, complementing the subject matter of the vivid mural on the north wall.  The air seems to be growing more humid the farther west you travel."
