  "description": [
    "Grass, shrubs, and even small hills have been flattened by a logging road many yards wide stretching between the forest to the west and the settlement to the east.  Carts trundle by frequently, and it appears that at times the traffic has been heavy enough to carve two separate sets of ruts into the mud.  A small peak rises to the south, and the low stone buildings of a sizeable town dot its slopes.  A cobblestone road heads south, towards the town."
