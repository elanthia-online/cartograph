  "description": [
    "A desolate and withered garden occupies the entirety of the courtyard.  The air is stale and fetid, and the reek of standing water perfumes the air.  In the center of an otherwise stagnant pool, a single spring bubbles erratically several inches above the surface of the murky water.  Cracked and chipped walls are painted with faded seascapes, each prominently featuring a blackened coiled sea creature."
