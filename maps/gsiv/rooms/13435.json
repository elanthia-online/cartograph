    "Separated by narrow walkways, shallow felwood vats fill most of the high walled workyard.  Wider walkways fill the space between the workyard walls and the vats on all but the north side, where the brine-filled vats are lined up snug against the whitewashed wall of a warehouse.  Seawater, in various stages of evaporation, fills the handsbreadth-deep vats to different levels.  A wooden trough extends from a central leather-bellowed pump, evidently for pumping up water from the tidal pools beneath the yard."
