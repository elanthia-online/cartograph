    "The grasses and reeds give way as the stream flows quietly into the lake.  Calm waters of this cove stifle the remaining movement of the stream, with only the faint waving of tall reeds giving any motion to this peaceful scene.  A deep fog hangs in the air further out from shore, smothering sound and vision."
