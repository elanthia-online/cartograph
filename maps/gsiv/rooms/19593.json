    "Heavily laden with sweet, clean-scented honeysuckle vines, a trellis arches over the pathway to create a tunnel that opens into three sections.  Enormous vases mark each area and are painted with cobalt patterns that mimic the rolling of waves.  Carefully cultivated flowerbeds are segmented by smoothed stones, while blown glass feeders offer a tantalizing treat to lapis and emerald hummingbirds.",
