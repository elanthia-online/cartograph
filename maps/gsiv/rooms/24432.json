    "Moonlight floods through the curved windows of the circular room, bathing the grand foyer's mosaic floor in ethereal light.  Various libations are offered atop an enormous alabaster desk, an unmovable relic of the former reception area.  Beside the desk sits a tall potted plant, its leaves twitching almost imperceptibly.  A series of painted murals cover the walls, reaching upwards to the domed ceiling.  Opposite the entry doors, the painted walls curve away to the north, forming a narrow circular hallway.",
