  "description": [
    "Rough oak walls rise from dusty floorboards, their warped faces and roughened edges bespeaking their age and improper maintenance.  Copper and wrought iron lanterns swing from exposed rafters that support a thatched roof, while narrow windows lined with wool curtains struggle to keep the chill of the outdoors at bay.  A worktable occupies the center of the space, while two cots flank a pot bellied stove opposite the lodge's only door."
