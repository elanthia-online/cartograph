    "Climbing under the wall and up into this room, you find yourself on top of a pile of rubble, up near the ceiling.  There's a trapdoor set in the center of the ceiling within your reach.  This is a good thing, because you can make out the remnants of a ladder, smashed to splinters beneath the collapsed wall."
