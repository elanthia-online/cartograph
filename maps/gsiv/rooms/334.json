    "The broad, red brick bulk of a local brewery dominates the street.  A few night workers clad in drab smocks and leather aprons loiter around the structure, taking a break for a pipe and a mug of ale.  The old oaken sign that hangs above the brewery gate squeaks back and forth on iron hinges in the night wind that blows in from the waters to the north and west.",
    "The broad, red brick bulk of a local brewery dominates the street, and all activity on this block seems to center around it.  Workers clad in drab smocks and leather aprons wander in and out of the structure, and grim-faced militiamen brush past them.  The old oaken sign that hangs above the brewery gate squeaks back and forth on iron hinges in the wind that blows in from the waters to the north and west."
