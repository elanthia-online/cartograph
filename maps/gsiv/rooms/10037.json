    "A huge stone arch, pitted by moisture and acrid air, rises overhead, the only standing remnant of the courtyard that stood here uncounted centuries ago.  The crumbled circle of a fountain lies in the center of the ruin amid broken limestone slabs and fallen chunks of weatherworn granite, all but a few shards of its marble long since looted."
