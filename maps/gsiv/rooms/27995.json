    "Thick animal pelts cover the floor of the large geteld to keep in the warmth while thick green felt lines the oak-framed walls.  Crafted from stone, a brazier rests in the center of the space, its rounded surface and pedestal carved in the shape of a ram.  A woven wisteria basket filled with dry sticks and tinder is placed near the shelter opening.  Flanking the heat source are a pair of small pine chairs layered with warm sheepskin."
