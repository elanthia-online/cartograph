  "description": [
    "The muddy lane curves around the tall wooden fence that surrounds the boatyard, and shouting and banging noises from the other side fill the air, along with a pervasive scent of paint, sawdust, and old fish.  Rundown shacks line the fence and fill the puddle-strewn flatland that extends to the river's edge."
