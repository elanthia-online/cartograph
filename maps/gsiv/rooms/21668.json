    "The interior yellow walls of the tent are heavily adorned with colorful wreaths and rows of decorative crystal icicles hang from the ceiling beams, twinkling as light catches their surfaces.  A row of stone ovens have been set out in the back of the tent, the strong fragrance of baked goods permeating the area.  A line of simple wooden tables dominate the center of the tent."
