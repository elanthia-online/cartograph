    "An ankle-deep swamp covers this low spot of the forest; the murky water ripples concentric circles away from every footstep.  Small gnats swarm through the heavy air, darting at anything that moves.  The soft buzzing of the bugs blends in with the constant singing of tree frogs in nature's ambient harmony."
