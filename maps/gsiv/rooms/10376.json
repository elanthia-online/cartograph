  "description": [
    "Rows of neatly-trimmed hedges line the walkway leading toward an ivory-walled building to the east, while a smaller domed structure is visible to the north.  Oak trees stretch their gnarled limbs across the sky, their large boughs filled with a healthy collection of verdant leaves.  Carved wooden benches beneath the trees bear ornate, looping designs across their richly-stained surfaces, and the buzz of daily life filters in faintly from beyond the courtyard."
