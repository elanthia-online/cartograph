    "Dominating this small chamber is an enormous blackened iron cauldron, occupying nearly half the space available.  Glowing red coals radiate oppressive heat from the pit situated below the cauldron.  A thick, dark russet curtain has been draped across the large hole leading back into the main cavern."
