  "description": [
    "Exquisitely crafted heavy wool tapestries cover every wall in this generously sized room.  Each tapestry looks to be devoted to a different branch of the arcane arts and is filled with images and sigils that hint at hidden meanings.  Thick, colorful rugs cover the chilly stone floor, complementing the colors and patterns of the tapestries.  The well-lit room is devoid of furniture or any obvious light-source, and the unexpected fragrance of ozone permeates the air."
