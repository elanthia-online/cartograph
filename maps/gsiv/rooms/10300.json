    "This tiny shop is cramped further by large compartmented shelves on either side filled with charts, maps, atlases, and instruments for navigation.  The pigeonholes are each carefully labeled in tiny handwritten script.  Cramped into a small space surrounded by stacks of dusty reference books is the writing table of the shop's proprietor."
