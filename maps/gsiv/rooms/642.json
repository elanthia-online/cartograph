    "Drawing attention from passersby with their blazing hues, incarnadine blossoms of anemones and roses are interrupted by the pale petals of stargazer lilies.  A pair of grey-blue cottages with crimson silk awnings lie beyond the extravagant flower garden.  Standing between the entryways is a pristine marble statue clutching a gold-inked sign.",
    "Cast in silvery moonlight, very few people pass through this portion of the bazaar at night.  A pair of grey-blue cottages with crimson silk awnings lie beyond an extravagant flower garden.  Standing between the entryways is a pristine marble statue clutching a gold-inked sign."
