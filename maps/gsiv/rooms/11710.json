    "Extending from the wall by several feet is the imposing gateway through the walls of the keep.  A portcullis remains only partially lowered, frozen by rust and covered with dead brown vines, allowing for entry underneath its rows of black metal points designed to penetrate the ground.  beneath the portcullis, the graveled road leads inward while a footpath extends to the east to the corner of the walls.",
