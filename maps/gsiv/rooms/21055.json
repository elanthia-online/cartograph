    "Evidence of the regular bouts of rain that supply the jungle with much needed nutrients, several small pools of water have formed in the hollows of fallen trees and among the foliage.  Mosquitoes buzz around the surface of each one, and the occasional frog immerses itself under the liquid.  The rich soil of the jungle floor is moist and difficult to travel through, though the leaves scattered about the ground provide a bit of traction."
