    "Across from a tall stone building with no windows, the forge fires have gone out in a blacksmith's stall.  Rusty horseshoes are nailed above the work shed, and a thick, green scum lines a shallow water trough near the anvil.  Weapons and armor in need of repair are stacked haphazardly in a cart out front."
