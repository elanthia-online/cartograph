    "Dark and small, the room is circular and built of granite, with a vaulted ceiling outlined with gleaming white marble.  A few torches placed in sconces throughout the room provide a paltry amount of illumination, their light reflected by jars and containers set upon several shelves.  Against one wall stands a worktable upon which several items rest."
