  "description": [
    "Wandering aimlessly through the pleasant meadow, you notice a few ruined markers, milestones, and a number of weed-covered mounds just to the north.  A dark, thin vertical shape and a squarer black one cleave the sky farther north.  Receding into the distance are low mountains in the northeast."
