    "Cramped quarters only allow for sparse furniture.  A narrow wooden table stands near a solid black wooden door, its surface covered with small weaponry.  Near the back, a rickety ladder leads through a rectangular hole in the ceiling.  Partially falling apart with rot, a long water-damaged rack encompasses one full wall and houses shields of various sizes and styles."
