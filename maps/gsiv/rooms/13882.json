    "River Ne'Halin courses swiftly beneath an arched bridge constructed of beautifully veined granite.  The bridge is wide, although the handrails are quite low.  Two carved lions stand sentry on each side of the span's entry, their expressions alert, one with a full mane and the other, obviously a lioness."
