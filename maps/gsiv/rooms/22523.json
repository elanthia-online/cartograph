    "Mauve sillk curtains cover a large bay window, while numerous silver oil lamps flicker gaily, casting the entire shop in warm light.  A small oval table stands between a polished mahogany display and a black walnut display, supporting a few mirrors and an embossed white card.  A portrait in fine oils hangs on the back wall, depicting two elves in a tender kiss.",
