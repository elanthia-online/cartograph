    "Rising above the muddy pathway and then dipping back into the earth, a thick stream of black sludge winds its way in a serpentine path around large petrified spires.  Floating orange fungus swirls past upon the dark current and clings to the slippery banks and the roots of the various dead trees.  Wide, elephant-eared ferns create a bright green splash of color that interrupts the dismal nature of the swamp."
