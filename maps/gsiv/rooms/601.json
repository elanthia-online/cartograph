    "A cool, slightly dank air pervades this round room, its source a gently gurgling fountain surrounded by a curving border of black oak benches.  Crafted in the form of a dancing wood sprite, the dark rock of the fountain provides a tiered descent for the flowing water as it winds its way to a circular pool at the base of the sculpture.  An arched, stained glass window stands behind the fountain, shedding pale light across the softly undulating surface of the pool."
