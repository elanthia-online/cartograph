    "A midnight-hued stained glass mosaic hangs on one of the weathered mistwood plank walls, and a tall wide-beamed ceiling rises overhead.  A pair of combat-locked statues sits in one corner of a distressed dark oak floor.  There is some polished black ash shelves on one side of the shop and some dark grey glaes display hooks on the other."
