  "description": [
    "Swelling in breadth and depth, the Mistydeep appears impassive and majestic.  A family of ducks floats single file along one shore while geese peck at morsels between the pebbles nearby.  Deer tracks lead from the forest to the river's edge in a confused mishmash, indicating common use.  Houses commingle with the woods at the western bank while, to the east, the opposite shore is less easily discerned."
