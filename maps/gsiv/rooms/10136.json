    "A path cuts through the thicket of vines to the west, the faint outline of a meadow seen behind the sinuous plants.  Tussock lines the dark mere floor, encircling numerous deep pools of sticky ooze emanating a noisome smell.  The surroundings impede any light passing through its dense foliage, the air itself seems black and heavy to breathe."
