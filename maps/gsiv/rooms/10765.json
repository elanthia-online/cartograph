    "Large bay windows look out upon the dark exterior of the manor, their arched forms shot through with webs of glimmering silver that sparkle with lustrous opalescent highlights.  Rich crimson rugs drape across the hardwood floor, their soft tassles brushing against the creamy white walls.  A variety of doors run along the northern edge of the hallway, their surfaces chased with incarnadine spirals.",
