    "Dozens of sharp metallic spikes protrude from the walls, and impaled on three of them are the mummified, humanoid remains of two males and one female.  Their battered armor appears to have been sliced open with a sharp instrument and is scattered haphazardly along the ground.  Blood splatters cover the wall and a pool of it had collected underneath the corpses.  An odd scraping sound comes from the far corner."
