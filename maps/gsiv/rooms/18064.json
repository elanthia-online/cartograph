    "Intricately carved wooden screens provide some privacy for this spartan workspace.  A polished granite workbench, positioned near a narrow slit window in the curving stone wall to the north, holds neatly arrayed flasks, tongs, and other tools of the alchemical trade.  Stone steps lead upwards to a small platform to the southwest, in the center of the room."
