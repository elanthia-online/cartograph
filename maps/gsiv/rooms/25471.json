    "Glittering mica in the walls reflects the glow from the candlelabra that dot the surface, creating a shimmering rainbow of color.  The stone floor is rough but level, providing a suitable surface on which to walk.  A section of the wall is carved out to make a shelf, and recessed lighting provided by small lanterns illuminates the contents.  Mostly hidden by the curvature of the walls, a jagged crack looms in one corner like a darkened maw, while the cave opening offers random gusts of fresh air from outside."
