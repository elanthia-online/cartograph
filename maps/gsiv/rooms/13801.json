    "Dunes wrap around the feet of a grove of tall pines on the north edge of a clearing.  Moss, sage and heather grow rampantly to the tree-line, scenting the air with their tangy perfume.  Small waves hitting the shore of the lake provide a background melody to the call of birds skimming the water off-shore.  A few homes rest in the peaceful solitude of the clearing, adding the flicker of a candle or two to the magic of the scene."
