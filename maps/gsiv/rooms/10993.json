    "A restrained chaos dominates the supply office of the Adventurer's Guild.  Bolts of fabric are scattered about the area, covering walls, tables, and floor with garish combinations of color.  Half-finished project lists are strewn across the tables or stuffed haphazardly onto shelves.  A long oak counter blocks access to the work area, which features a more orderly selection of wares, including many fine weapons and jewelry items arranged in peculiar pairings on the various display racks."
