    "Pale periwinkle wisteria vines drape across the smooth white marble of an aged temple as it rises suddenly across the pathway and blocks further progress to the north.  Painted windows shimmer as they reflect golden sunlight into the pools that ring the temple's base, their waters speckled with anemones and water lilies and bisected by a pair of smooth marble steps etched with the image of frolicking sea otters playing with dolphins.",
