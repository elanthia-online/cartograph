  "description": [
    "A narrow, rickety railing runs along the perimeter of the wagon's roof, but judging by the state of disrepair it would be best to stick to the center.  Stacks of crates and boxes held down by leather straps make the roof difficult to traverse.  The top of the gold-painted ladder juts out from the back of the wagon, leading back down to the ground."
