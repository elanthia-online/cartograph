    "Subdued light from elegant arrangements of glowing fungi casts weird shadows on walls of rough-hewn granite.  Gargoyles crouch and prowl on every surface, displaying the most fantastic combinations of humanoid and animal features as their clawed, taloned, furred, and scaled paws proffer trays heaped high with trinkets for the consideration of the discerning customer."
