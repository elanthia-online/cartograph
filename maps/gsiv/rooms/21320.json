    "In this alcove, a massive bedstead nearly fills the space.  Several thickly stuffed feather mattresses piled upon each other peek out from beneath an embroidered quilt the color of the noon sky high atop a mountain.  Plump, well-fed pillows laze across the bed, some spilling onto the floor where they lie, intertwined, like satiated lovers.  A light floral scent emanates from a silver vial sitting atop the carved nightstand."
