    "An open garden has been cleared between the buildings, bounded by a fence of dark polished wood.  A few scattered iceblossoms bloom in the corners of the enclosure, but the main expanse of the garden is a square of snowy, open ground surrounding a few strategically placed stones.  The frost-dusted dirt has been raked into geometric patterns around the stones, and several small benches provide seating from which to comtemplate the patterns.",
