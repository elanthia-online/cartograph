    "A strident voice calling patrons to the rat races in the Bazaar rises up to the walls at every hour of the day.  The narrow lane between city wall and warehouses known as Trade Alley sees occasional foot traffic from adventurers and citizens alike.  To the east stands a thick forest that could be hiding any manner of threat to the peace of the city."
