    "An overpowering aroma of brine fills the tent, emanating from an unknown source.  Across the tent's ceiling hangs a large white banner, stretching from one wall to the other, and underneath it, multiple stands and tables full of weapons and armor.  A stack of pickle jars line one wall, serving as a stand for a square green placard with yellow lettering."
