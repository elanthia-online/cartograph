    "An expansive structure of grey stone stands rooted to the mountaintop, its foundation extending deep into the rock.  Inside the courtyard, the tall marble walls are nearly invisible under a riot of crawling green jasmine vines covered in fragrant blooms.  The lush flora of the courtyard is at odds with the climate, right down to the purple nightshade blooming along the edges of the steps."
