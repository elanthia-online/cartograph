    "Low squared-off bushes front the properties alongside the roadway.  Bright pink blooms spot the dark green shrubs, a counterpoint to the golden marigolds lining the walkways to the front doors of houses in this part of the neighborhood.  An occasional swingset stands in yards with homes owned by families with smaller children."
