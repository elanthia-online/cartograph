    "Flat and wide stone steps follow a winding trail up the side of the mountain, the sinuous path dotted with lanterns that dispel local shadows created by surrounding rocky outcroppings and the thick canopy of leaves.  White-flowered kelleria dot the edges of the smooth slabs, while rust-hued lichen darkens the surfaces.  A thin brook trickles down from above, disappearing in the nearby ground cover as it heads deeper into the aspen grove to the southeast."
