    "Glossy mistwood walls rise from a dark-stained oak floor.  Just above an elegantly dressed maiden statue hangs a pearl-handled filigreed mandolin, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  Some hammered copper display hooks and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet stand side by side in the middle of the room."
