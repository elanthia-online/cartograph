  "description": [
    "Uprooted cobblestones clutter the exterior of the fortress amid the scattered remains of roofing tiles and scorched timber.  Sunburned grasses attempt to claim the forgotten pieces, but the insistent force of the wind in this location prevents them from making more than a cursory purchase in the dark soil.  A cracked wrought iron cauldron lays half-buried in the dirt near the northern edge of the path."
