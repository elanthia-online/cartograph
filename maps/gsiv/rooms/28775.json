  "description": [
    "Mirrored diamond panels wink merrily from the wall behind the bar, reflecting the fire glow from the greatroom.  The refracted light gleams off of the edges of old bottles on a multi-tiered set of glass shelves, revealing glass in every color of the rainbow and more.  A tallish human bartender, Lenton, mans the station, his fastidiousness evident in the clean, neatly ordered bar he tends.  Shakers of herb bitters, vermouth, and other, more arcane concoctions line the backside of the bar in even rows."
