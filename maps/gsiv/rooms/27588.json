  "description": [
    "Dimly glowing orbs line the ceiling of this compact space that smells faintly of brine and polish.  Brass tubes run the length of the walls, parting at angles around a brass porthole window, then reconnecting on the other side, some ending at tanks bolted to the wall, others disappearing into the bulkhead.  Secured to the wall amongst the maze of tubing is a brass-framed portrait.  At the center of the space, a squared wooden chair swivels between a knob-covered wood control panel and a brass and walnut music box.  Descending from the ceiling is a shiny bronze tube ending with a glass eyepiece."
