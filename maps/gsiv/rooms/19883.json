    "The surroundings of the room have been tinted a soft aquamarine shade, and a large blue glaes-paneled lantern sways softly from above, casting a rippling oceanic light upon the chamber.  Faint stylized images of fish, whales, and other creatures of the deep are engraved on the floor, each encircling an altar of coral.  A statue of a man wielding a trident seems to flow out from the walls, his gaze over the area an unmistakably stern one."
