    "A silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the rough plastered walls, and a woven seagrass ceiling rises overhead.  A tropical floral arrangement sits in one corner of a sturdy planked floor.  There is a long mistwood counter on one side of the shop and an aqua-hued seaglass display on the other."
