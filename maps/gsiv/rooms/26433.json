    "A single beam of diffuse, pale light reflects intermittantly off the surface of a large, stagnant pool as moonbeams valiantly attempt to pierce the dense, silvery grey fog.  A wet plop sounds from the direction of the water, followed by an odiferous assault of rotten egg stench.  Crystallized mineral deposits surrounding the pool glitter in bands of green, blue, and yellow, reflecting effervescently in the available light.",
    "A stagnant, elongated pool makes traversing the area both nauseating and treacherous.  Thick steam, reeking of rotten eggs, is emitted each time a viscous bubble bursts free from the surface of the water.  Bands of green, blue, and yellow mark the deposits of crystallized minerals around the circumference of the pool's edge.  A quartet of sea stars and one enormous black slug lay dead on the path, clearly unsuccessful in their efforts to return to the sea.",
