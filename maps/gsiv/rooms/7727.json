    "The center of the cavern rises high above into a natural dome, near enough to the surface that rays of moonlight filter in through cracks and fissures in its vast crown.  Subtle shifts in the hues of the uneven stone, from greens to greys to spots of bright white, lend an almost unnatural beauty to the cavern.  A continuous trickle of water drips here and there from the sloping ceiling, disappearing into damp crevices in the porous stone.",
