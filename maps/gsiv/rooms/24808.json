    "Enclosed by polished oak walls, the shop features a subtle arrangement of fragrant pink stargazer lilies accented by tiny white iceblossoms in the center of its oak floor.  A painted silk wall panel hangs under the golden oak ceiling.  Right near the front is a lacquered white rosewood cabinet."
