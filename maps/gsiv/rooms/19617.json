    "Standing just ahead, two horses have been harnessed to the front of the wagon.  A cushioned rosewood seat rests before an elaborately carved red oak door, which leads back inside the wagon.  Just over the top of the seat, a purple and white awning is affixed to the red oak of the wagon, which helps block out the light of the sun."
