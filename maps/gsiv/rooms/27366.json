    "Lining one wall of the spacious wagon is a narrow table covered with vases of various shapes and sizes all filled with bright flowers.  Bunches of blossoms peek from inside baskets hanging from the rafters, their rich colors creating a brilliant canopy.  Standing to one side of a small painted door is a large wooden crate overflowing with a wide variety of gardening tools."
