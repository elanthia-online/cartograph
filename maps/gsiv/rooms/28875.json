  "description": [
    "Thousands of wild rose petals carpet the cold stone floor, filling the chamber with a sweetly perfumed smell.  To either side of a heavy oaken panel leading out to the chapel, golden torch sconces support torches that bathe the antechamber in bright light.  Despite the roses' aroma, there is a creeping scent of death wafting up from a crumbling stone staircase leading down into stygian darkness."
