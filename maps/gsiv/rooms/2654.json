  "description": [
    "The spines characteristic of the stone drake's neck and back continue down the length of its tail, although here, the spikes are shorter and more barbarously sharp.  The prospect of carving stone into a point as keen as any rendered in steel is daunting, yet here a whole row of them stands like a honed ridge of deadly pikes."
