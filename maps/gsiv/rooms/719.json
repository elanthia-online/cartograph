    "Meandering along towards the edges of the cliffs, the var continues to skirt the bottom of the bell tower.  Deep green ivy encases the bottom section of the tower in a living green carpet, as the upper portion of the silvery blue stone bell tower soars overhead.  A silvery blue stone building and a small shop are tucked back to either side of the spire."
