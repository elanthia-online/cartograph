    "Vandalism has clearly been a problem on this tiny, enclosed porch.  Moonlight reflects off of the shards of shattered glass beneath a broken window and, even in the dim light, an iron prybar can be seen resting beside some labeled shipping trunks.  Scorch marks along the walls, floor boards, and a blackened wood sign indicate that some have ignored the clear warning labels attached to each trunk.  A framed opening leads back to the main shop."
