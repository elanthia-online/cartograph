  "description": [
    "A particularly large limb extending from the trunk of the tree provides a comfortable perch to settle upon and observe the vast expanse of jungle both below and before it.  Enshrouded by the rest of the majestic being's vine-tangled limbs, the area is bestowed a reprieve from the heat by rustling leaves.  The whisper of the wind blowing through the secluded retreat is the sole interruption to the ever-present sounds of wildlife."
