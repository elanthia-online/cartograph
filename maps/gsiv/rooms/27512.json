    "Brilliant blues, iridescent indigoes, and vivacious violets seem to be the common themes in this compartment.  Colorful garments are stored on a low plum-colored counter while others are visible inside a short lilac-painted armoire.  Clashing with the rest of the room's theme, a painted black and white door leads towards the back of the wagon, and a green paint-chipped archway leads back towards the front of the wagon."
