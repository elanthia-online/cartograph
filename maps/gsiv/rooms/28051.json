  "description": [
    "A scattered group of tree stumps sit on either side of the viewing stands, each one stained a deep black, then adorned with a shield engraved with the image of a fiery vermilion phoenix.  Well-used horseshoes weigh down the shields, although the muddied grass beneath appears to have a firm hold regardless of assistance.  The sounds of clashing metal dance together with the murmurs of market noise coming from the southwest."
