    "The summit of the tower spreads out in a large, round platform.  The platform has been made from black marble to absorb as much ambient light as possible, and the sides of the platform are walled to a height of four feet to shut off light from the city below.  Under a nearby overhang, several charts depict the nighttime constellations along with descriptions of the most popular ones.  A large pipe rising from the platform's floor belches steam thirty feet above the platform."
