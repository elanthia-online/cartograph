    "Lining the walls of the corridor are weapon racks, absent of their intended inventory, coated in layers of dust.  Beneath the racks are placed simple wood benches, most in the process of falling victim to dry rot and several disappearing into small piles of sawdust.  Scattered across much of the floor are empty green and brown glass bottles, many crushed, covering the floor with sharp-edged broken pieces."
