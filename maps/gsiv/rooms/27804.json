    "A large ivory fountain stands within the center of a large circle of cobblestones, its beautiful architecture sending forth a triad of trickling streams to gurgle in a pleasant, soothing fashion.  The swaying, shadowy boughs of many trees loom above, and half-moon benches form a circle around the fountain."
