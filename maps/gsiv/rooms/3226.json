    "Cresting the hill provides an overview of Icemule Trace near this part of the wall.  Several streets are visible, crowded with people going about their daily business.  Smooth, flattened paths streak down the hill to the stone fortification rising up at the bottom, indicating that this is a popular locale for sledding."
