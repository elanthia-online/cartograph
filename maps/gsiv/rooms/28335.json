    "The rich cherrywood paneling of this long hallway is punctuated by polished brass sconces, whose steady glow reflects from the ivory coffered ceiling.  A thick wool runner, woven in jewel-hued shades of green and blue, muffles the footsteps of passersby from the scholars of the adjacent library."
