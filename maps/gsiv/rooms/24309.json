    "The spacious and airy chamber is carpeted in soft coyote hide, and oil lamps set between the doors on all four walls provide a gentle illumination.  Tapestries and large paintings cover the walls between the doors and windows.  Stairs carved from one of the tree's branches lead down, and a nearby ladder leads up."
