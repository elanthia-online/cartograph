    "Pure white cobblestones mark the entrance to a low-roofed marble shrine, its alabaster surface wrought with a tangle of crimson veins.  Fluted columns of the same unblemished ivory hue line the walkway leading to the small structure, each set with stylized black daggers overlaying faceted ruby hearts.  Well-trimmed topiaries flank the edges of the garden, their inorganic shapes and deep green leaves adding a touch of elegance to the surroundings."
