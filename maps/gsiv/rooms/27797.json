    "Well-lit by a variety of amber-paned oil lamps, the bar appears to be quite generously stocked.  A variety of bar stools line the edge of the bar, each richly padded with ornately-trimmed velvet.  Several crystal musical notes dangle along the ceiling, their rainbow sheen warping the wavering light of the cozy room."
