  "description": [
    "Oily, deep green vines, some nearly black, have overtaken the walls of the corridor, making it more of a jungle than a hallway.  Originally planted in large tubs along each side of the passage, the vines have grown together over the ceiling, making them impossible to remove without destroying the plants entirely.  Wickedly barbed, tendril-like feelers reach from the sides of the hallway across the pale marble flooring."
