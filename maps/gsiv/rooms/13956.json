  "description": [
    "A neatly raked path winds through stands of young willows and white birches that flank the wide Mistydeep River to the east and Avocet Creek, babbling down the last stretch of its narrow course.  The path divides around a lens-shaped pool, home to a school of brilliant orange and silver fish."
