    "This broad expanse of open land is fringed by a variety of trees and shrubs.  Shaded by majestic oaks is an inviting picnic area with rough-hewn benches, tables, and a blackened grill.  Draped by sweet-smelling wildflowers and fed by a tributary of the Locksmehr River, a small clear lake laps at a sandy bank.  A sturdy wooden dock juts a short way into the water, and a large steel bucket sits in the lake's shallows, tethered to a nearby tree trunk."
