    "The rough walls are covered with bits of wood and particles of sawdust in mute testament to the violence perpetuated on lumber here.  A large bin, clearly labeled \"Firewood\", sits empty against one wall.  Several even larger bins sit against the opposite wall, filled to overflowing with stripped branches, awaiting someone to bash them into usable chunks."
