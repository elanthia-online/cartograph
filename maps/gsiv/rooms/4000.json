    "The top of this peak is a rise of solid black stone covered in ice.  In stark contrast to the high winds on the winding trails below, the air here is completely still.  Apparently the calm appeals to something else, as a huge nest of twisted tree trunks and whole bushes is splayed over much of the available level surface.  To the southwest, a long gash in the black rock leads back into the wind."
