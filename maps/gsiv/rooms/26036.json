  "description": [
    "A bronze-beaked falcon figurehead juts from the prow of the vessel, its spread wings embracing the crimson-painted hull.  Wrought from verdigris bronze, a waist-high railing mimics vines twining around modwir saplings.  A carved redwood ship's wheel crowns a raised platform several paces behind the figurehead."
