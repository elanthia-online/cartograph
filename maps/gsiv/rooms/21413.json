    "Sparse foliage rises to either side of the thick oak planks that are laid upon the soggy ground.  Though devoid of trees, small bushes, decorated with baubles and bells, share their verdant hues with the mostly yellow landscape and thick grasses near the southern edge of the plank walkway stand up straight in the mud.  A wooden fence to the northeast blocks access to a slowly revolving carousel, but the haunting out-of-tune melody is inescapable.",
    "Sparse foliage rises to either side of the thick oak planks that are laid upon the soggy ground.  A dirty elven boy slouches against a large box, and a pile of wooden tokens occupies a bucket sitting next to a large wooden frame.  Small bushes, decorated with baubles and bells, occupy the area around the frame, and share their verdant hues with the yellow landscape and thick grasses near the plank walkway.  A wooden fence to the northeast blocks access to a slowly revolving carousel, but the haunting out-of-tune melody is inescapable."
