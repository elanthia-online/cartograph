    "This is not so much an alley as a very narrow street, pressed on both sides by a crowd of homes and shops.  At the south end on the west side is a tall wooden fence, intricately painted in a green and gold pattern.  There's a large gap underneath it where someone has scooped out the snow.  Off to one side, a wooden counter squats before a target painted on a wall."
