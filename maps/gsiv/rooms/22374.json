    "The intimate but well-appointed office is graced by a crescent-shaped desk of beautifully stained wood, its surface clear but for a quill, an inkpot, and a blue Vornavian rose.  Behind the comfortable chair seated at the desk, a silken banner depicting a spread-winged white swan on a field of verdant green graces the silvery stone wall with a splash of color."
