    "Rows upon rows of tiered seating climb their way up the walls nearly to the high ceiling.  Silver-swept candleholders all hold bright, unwavering flames near each small desk, and a single large crystal orb stands in the center stage.  Faint luminescence pulses from within the confines of the flawlessly smooth orb, its pale violet hue washing over the surroundings in soft waves."
