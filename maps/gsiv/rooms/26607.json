    "The spacious cabin is encircled by slender modwir panels that are artfully scorched with the dark silhouettes of floating aspen leaves.  Lengths of tawny doeskin stretch beneath a silver-traced faewood case and a carved white oak display on the eastern wall.  A tiered candelabra suspending a multitude of brilliant gem-tipped maoral rootlets hangs over a lacquered rowan cabinet at the back, its slow-burning beeswax candles illuminating the entire room."
