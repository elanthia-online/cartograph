    "The massive stones completely encircle you.  The fit of each lintel is exact, and a twin of the others.  Underneath one arch, the brook burbles down into a pool in the center of the circle, filling a small depression, and then moving on through the other side.  The quietness and tranquillity of this place is lulling, and seems to provide a haven for rest and healing."
