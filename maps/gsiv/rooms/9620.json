    "A fire burns cheerily in this one-room cabin's fireplace.  Spartan furnishings convey a sense of loneliness and a lack of concern for creature comforts.  In one corner a cot resides, covered with an unkempt grey blanket.  A single chair snuggles up to the rough-hewn pine table in the room's center.  The cabin's door is propped open, allowing fresh air to circulate liberally.  Much of it is drawn up in the fireplace's rising heat, carrying the scent of cooking stew out through the chimney."
