  "description": [
    "A small hillock that is completely covered with tall, sturdy swampgrass has risen high enough out of the muck to allow for a few structures to be built upon it.  Since the ground is somewhat solid, the homes don't have any of the thick stout poles generally attached to the huts and shacks of this neighborhood.  Several flittering will-o'-the-wisps are winking in and out of sight nearby, creating a dazzling light show for those with time to watch."
