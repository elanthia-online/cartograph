    "Weatherworn barrels have been sealed shut and half-buried in sand, their dark lids forming a wide smile, but one has been left accessible.  A few banana peels have been tossed aside around a support beam made to look like a palm tree.  Crashed into the base of the faux tree is an odd makeshift boat created from an enormous barrel."
