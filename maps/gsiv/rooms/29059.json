    "Hoof prints, paw prints, and the barefoot prints of bi-pedal humanoids crisscross the boggy ground of this juncture.  Suspended from overhanging tree limbs, circular bone and bead talismans swing side-to-side with the occasional gusts of wind.  A few narrow beams of moonlight pierce the overhead canopy to illuminate the soggy ground."
