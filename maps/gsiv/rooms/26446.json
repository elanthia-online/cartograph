    "Sanded planks of blonde oak are branded with a variety of moons, stars, and celestial markings from one wall to the next.  Draping from a polished globe of brass in the center of the ceiling, swathes of sky blue chiffon billow down and connect in narrow strips to the four corners of the room.  A curved archway is nestled between dual brass racks displaying wares and a glass display case is centerpoint to the entry door."
