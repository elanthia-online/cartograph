  "description": [
    "Running to the east and north, the hallway turns at a right angle past a simple wooden door.  Paintings line each side of the hallway, interspersed between brass candelabras built into the wall and backed by small mirrors.  The rug laid out along the length of the hallway, decorated in a diamond and square pattern, is particularly worn at the doorway."
