    "A sense of mingled dread and curiosity causes the students within to lower their voices to a respectful hush while perusing the tall bookcases that line much of the walls.  The rest of the space is taken up by anatomy charts and portraits of notable sorcerers, although the stone floor remains bare of everything except the remains of a few chalked symbols.  Standing near a long marble table is an apothecary's desk filled with dried or pickled bits of once-living things."
