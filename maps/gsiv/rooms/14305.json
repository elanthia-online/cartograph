    "Unlike the rest of the tavern, the room is immaculately kept, its polished, ebonwood-paneled walls glowing with a rich sheen.  Iron stands filled with midnight-hued candles add a warm light, as the thick, closed indigo velvet curtains filter out any other illumination.  A vase brimming with fresh mournblooms sits on a table next to a featherbed made up with silver satin sheets.  Ruby port fills a thick leaded glass decanter and two small tulip-shaped flutes invite guests to relax with a postprandial drink."
