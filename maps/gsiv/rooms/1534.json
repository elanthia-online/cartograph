    "A few small houses line the street here, their quaint and plain architecture overshadowed by the large wall of the Beacon Tower looming north in the darkness.  Faint candlelight filters out from the a few of the curtained windows, though most appear to be dark.",
    "A few small houses line the street here, their quaint and plain architecture overshadowed by the large wall of the Beacon Tower looming to the north.
