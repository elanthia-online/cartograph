    "A flat plateau of snow stretches into the distance, bounded in the northern reaches by a snowy peak that shimmers in the light, looking as much cloud as mountain.  A cascade of boulders offers egress to a forested range of mountains, guarding the southern borders of the tundra.  Snow falls over the still landscape in intermittent flurries which sparkle when a persistent beam of light breaks through the assault of bitter storms.",
