  "description": [
    "Maces, hammers and clubs line the walls, each set off against its twin.  A three-headed flail crosses hafts with its double, and a simple duo of wooden truncheons is fastened beside it.  A lone quadrelle disrupts the pattern.  The tiles echo the pattern of the weapons along the walls, their diagonals interrupted by square-set tiles every few feet along the floor."
