  "description": [
    "A small chamber stretches north from the door, its deep black walls resembling a starless midnight sky.  Against the north wall rests a white marble dais, the brightly glowing stone a beacon of light in the dark surroundings.  A few candles burn in the room, and a silence fills the chamber like a fog.  An ancient wooden stand is positioned upon the dais, a field of translucent, crackling mana completely encasing the silver chalice that rests atop it."
