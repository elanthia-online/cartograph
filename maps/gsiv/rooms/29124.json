  "description": [
    "A series of wrought iron grips, affixed to irregular boulders, provide the only assurance of safety for those brave enough to traverse the steep and rocky terrain.  Fierce ocean winds whip across the exposed cliff face, threatening to send both rocks and travelers into the frothing waves far below.  Flecks of mica imbedded within the white wall of rock reflect specks of brilliant, golden light as the sun passes across the sky."
