    "This small landing provides storage and a rallying point above the ladder shaft.  Dark and small, a tunnel leads off to the northwest.  A ladder, running down a narrow, rounded hole, descends into inky darkness.  Stacks of rag-wrapped torches, their heads dipped into tar, are stored in piles around the perimeter of the landing."
