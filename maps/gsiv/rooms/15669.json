    "Walls of dark granite paneled in black oak encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a wood sprite hangs along one wall, opposite a hearth alive with dancing flames.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the sweet scent of flower petals rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its mottled linen snugly tucked."
