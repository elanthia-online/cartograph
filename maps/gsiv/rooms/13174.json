    "A tall hedge covered with fragrant blossoms surrounds a luscious pool, whose surface ripples and reflects the sun in long bright streaks.  A statue of Cholen, poised in mid-gesture, stands on rocks in the center of the pool.  A tiled walkway leads through cedar arches to the Bard Guild, and a magnificent carved teak open-air antechamber stands on the opposite side of the pool.  Carved into the arch over the antechamber, and painted in gilt and crimson, are the words \"Cholen's Temple.\"",
