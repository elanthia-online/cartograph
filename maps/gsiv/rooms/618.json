  "description": [
    "An imposing grey building huddles in the shelter of the city wall.  An engraved mithglin sign has been set into the dark granite beside a rounded archway that leads inside.  Above the archway, a large panel of granite has been embedded with an enormous mosaic formed of various gemstones.  Four round towers, each topped with a sapphire blue and silver pennant, mark the corners of the square building."
