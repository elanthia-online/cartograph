    "Greyed and cracked, an ancient oak rises from the thick undergrowth, a plethora of broken branches, fallen leaves and other debris scattered about its base.  The old oak has collapsed in upon itself.  Long cracks run the length of its trunk, and the knobby ends of fractured branches protrude at odd angles.  A massive branch has fallen from some height and lodged itself in an opening, providing a steep but stable climb to the upper area of the tree."
