    "A red and white candy-striped giftshop sits in the shade of a large, spreading oak tree, and a white-pebbled walkway leads toward an open door.  Tucked discreetly behind it down a gentle slope is a pink-bordered privy.  Surrounding both are painted flower boxes, though few blooms remain on the drying stems within."
