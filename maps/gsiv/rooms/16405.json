    "Curving off from the main circle of the bazaar, the shuttered stalls and night-shrouded shops lining this section of cobblestoned street are interspersed with stands of silver-barked birch trees and carefully manicured beds of white roses.  One trellis of flowers is marked with a triad of lit lanterns, their gentian glaes shades punctuating the pale wall of roseate blossoms.",
