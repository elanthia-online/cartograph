    "Brightly illuminated lanterns crisscross the narrow street overhead, suspended from strands of twine stretched taut between buildings.  Granite stones can be spotted under their soft glow, marking the way east and west.  Debris from the day's market traffic litters the streets, the lighter pieces tumbling about in the slight salt-scented breeze.",
    "Traffic wends through the alley, pedestrians paying no attention to propriety when making their way through the throngs.  Granite stones can be spotted occasionally through the sea of life, marking the way east and west.  Lanterns crisscross the narrow street overhead, suspended from strands of twine stretched taut between the buildings."
