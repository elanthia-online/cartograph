    "Only a few scattered bushes remain in the magic-scarred waste, bearing roses as black as the tower that rises in their midst.  The graceful obsidian walls of the dark edifice are smooth and seamless, and no entrance is visible.  The air here in the tower's shadow crackles with a dark energy that seems to crawl along your skin."
