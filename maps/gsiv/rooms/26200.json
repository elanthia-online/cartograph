    "A ridged ring circles the edge of this round table.  The chairs, spread comfortably in a circle around it, have similar carved ridges on their arms and seats.  The carvings also decorate the walls surrounding the booth, carved in perfect detail for the look and feel of the ridged texture of a sturgeon."
