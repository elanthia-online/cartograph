    "The walls of the tent are covered in feathers, all of various origin and color, and the strong smell of tar permeates the area.  Dozens of wire birdcages have been suspended from large rusty fishhooks that hang from the tent's apex.  A long wooden counter juts into the center of the room, and an overturned crate rests near the tent's flap."
