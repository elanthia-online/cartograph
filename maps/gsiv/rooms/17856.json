    "Displayed on glass shelves behind the long cherrywood bar is an impressive array of wines and spirits.  Centered in the wall behind the bar is a small window, through which a narrow ray of sunlight strikes the floor.  A young elven steward moves constantly around the area, doing light cleaning and occasionally filling a glass or restocking a small silver tray near the entrance with a variety of light refreshments.",
