    "Large well-trimmed green hedges mark the entrance to a maze-like garden, the pale white stones that mark the entrance swept with tiny chips of violet feystone.  A dark spiraled iron gate runs through the large hedges, its intricate twists and loops mirrored by the patterns cut meticulously into the living walls of green.  A few chairs and small tables are scattered across the area, offering a comfortable place for quiet discussion."
