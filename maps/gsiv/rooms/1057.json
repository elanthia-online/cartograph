    "The mouthwatering aroma of roast boar wafts in from the forest to the west accompanied by the inescapable sounds of merriment.  The lilting tones of musical instruments fill the air, and song voiced in a strange tongue rises and falls from deep within the forest.  Lights in varying soft colors flash suddenly among the trees, then wink out or move away with dizzying speed. The trail follows the curve of the forest from north to southwest."
