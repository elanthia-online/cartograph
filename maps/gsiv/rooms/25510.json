  "description": [
    "Talon-shaped marks are etched into the warm red oak of the wall panels bordering a small golvern-inlaid hatch, the only means of egress from the small workroom.  A tidy worktable sits beneath a flameless lamp of rainbow glaes at the room's center.  Its surface is strewn with an odd hodgepodge of divination tools and articles of the jeweler's craft.  Carved wooden masks hang from one wall, worked to resemble the faces of a variety of beasts."
