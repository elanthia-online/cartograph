    "The intermittent rhythm of movement through the street to the east and west is accentuated by a constant loud clanging coming from the north, where a column of smoke rises from a towering chimney.  A flatbed wagon has been abandoned here where it collided with the wall of a shabby workshop, and now serves only as a home for a few scrawny rats which scamper around its ruined platform.",
