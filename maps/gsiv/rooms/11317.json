    "This simply furnished room holds a massive bed, still covered with faded green sheets. Shredded papers, broken quills, smashed inkpots, and other ruined tools of a researcher's work have been scattered over the floor near the sandstone desk standing opposite the bed. To one side is a tall wardrobe, doors ajar, which houses a set of mithril chains, among other things."
