    "The boardwalk turns a bend to the south and northwest.  A break in the buildings that flank the walkway provides a view of the marsh that the town is built upon.  Occasional muddy mounds rise up from the marsh, possibly homes to some of the wildlife in the area.  The marsh sports several solid areas where the soil is exposed, but only thick, murky water sits beneath the barrels of Marshtown."
