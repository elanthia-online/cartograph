  "description": [
    "The keep widens dramatically in this space, exposing a length of open ground with full view of the misty skies above.  Underneath is a heavy layer of straw which serves to reinforce footing and cut down on muddy conditions.  Dotting the courtyard are a variety of wagons and tents, many with signs proclaiming their wares."
