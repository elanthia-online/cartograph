    "In the center of the warcamp is a wide area bordered by the many ragged tents and huts of the Grimswarm.  A towering wooden flagpole is situated at the north end of the assembly area and is flanked by a series of iron spikes driven into the ground, topped with sun-bleached skulls.  Lying so much like a forgotten rag doll, a body has been discarded in the middle of the open space, its limbs sprawled and twisted at unnatural angles."
