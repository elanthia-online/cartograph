    "Archway Square receives its name from the magnificent arch colonnade lining the perimeter.  Each arch is uniquely carved by artisans residing in town and kept up by dedicated crews each night. Houses within Archway Square stand aloof, regally reflecting the light bouncing off the beautiful columns near them."
