    "Towering and visually dominating, a huge beech tree stands watch over the forest.  Its buttressed roots fan out about the trunk, creating bridges and archways, some large enough to walk or crawl under.  A rich green moss covers the sturdy liana vines that climb down the tree and hang from the branches.  Collecting into pools on the large leaves of the jungle plants, moisture from the ever-present mist thickly coats each visible surface."
