    "The view from the ship's bow is magnificent.  The deep sapphire blue sea is softly slapping against the schooner with a caress that is both rhythmic and reassuring.  Tiny whitecaps ripple along the oceans surface from the constant breeze, and an occasional spray of surf reaches the upper railing to lightly drench those looking outward.",
