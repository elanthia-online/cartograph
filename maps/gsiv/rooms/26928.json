    "A long wooden table stands in the center of the room surrounded by high-backed chairs with crushed velvet seats.  Inviting smells of honey-sweet glazes, roasting vegetables, and an array of herbs waft from the kitchen beyond the swinging doors where a bustle of staff move in and out.  Beyond the doors, an occasional loud crash can be heard, followed quickly by a bellowing voice spewing profanities.  A small sturdy brass heating stove sits in the corner next to a slatted wooden bin."
