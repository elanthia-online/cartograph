  "description": [
    "Billowing clouds glide past upon a persistent breeze that brings both a light chill and the scent of desiccated flesh to the air.  Whistling slightly in its passage, the zephyr dances around the defenses spikes recessed into the walls and along the deep cuts of the distant crenellation.   A lone wren insistently taps at a walnut shell it has wedged into the fitted stones of the bulwark."
