    "Gleaming bricks of smooth black onyx reflect the light from a wall-mounted vaalin lamp.  No window disturbs the flame and the lamp's unwavering glow suffuses the air, which is noticeably heavy and still.  A narrow staircase leads back down to the main hall, and enclosed corridors stretch off to the north and southeast."
