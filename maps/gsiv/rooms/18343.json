  "description": [
    "The shadows of night provide a dark background to the expanse of sand surrendering to the ocean's grasp as its foamy waves rush forth and retreat rhythmically on the shoreline.  A flock of pelicans rest upon a large boulder, their bodies still but for the occasional shift of feet as they huddle together in the moonlight.  Collections of seaweed cling to the debris cluttering the beach, and moonlight reflects from the dark surface of the ocean as the sound of waves crashing filters in on the evening breeze."
