  "description": [
    "The thin trickling stream pools into a small hollow in the ground, eddying a bit before tumbling out the other side of the hollow and progressing down the creek bed.  The murmur of the stream is punctuated by the occasional *plop* of moisture falling from the trees overhead into the water below."
