    "The cozy interior of the wagon has been painted in warm autumnal hues and features a selection of comfy looking overstuffed armchairs.  Trays of steaming hot drinks and baked treats are crammed onto a small, rickety oak table that stands in the middle of the room.  Lazy smoke drifts up from a makeshift fireplace full of gently crackling applewood logs, creating a homely atmosphere."
