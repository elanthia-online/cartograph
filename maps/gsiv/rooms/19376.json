    "Bright violet canopies striped with grey are anchored to the tall pilings of the pier and sporadically bounce in the slight breeze that occasionally rises from off of the harbor.  Strung along the length of the fabric, tiny orbs glitter in the bright light of the day and reflect the light into rainbow swirls upon the whitewashed wood of the pier.  Descending towards a dock, a pair of smooth wooden steps slips through an arch hung with an elegant painted sign and is flanked by smooth wooden railings.",
