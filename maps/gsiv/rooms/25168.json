    "A huge copper-paneled sandstone wall stretches from east to west along the northern edge of the antechamber.  Limned across every available space along the wall are ancient friezes, each painting depicting the image of a serpent-headed humanoid locked in a detailed and macabre ritual.  A low, guttural sound echoes from somewhere unseen, rising and falling like an ocean tide."
