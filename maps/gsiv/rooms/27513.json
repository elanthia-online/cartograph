    "The six ramie silk walls of this tent cant outwards at a wide angle, opening up a large space that allows plenty of room for extensive examination of the garments for sale.  Tendrils of mist creep along the floor, nearly invisible except in the corners, where soft swirls of indigo gather.  Several large wrought iron stands hold trios of large candles that light the tent's interior from nearly every angle.",
    "The six ramie silk walls of this tent span outward at a wide angle, opening up a large space that is divided only by strips of decorative, multicolored linen that hang down and disappear into a lurking, swirling, clinging grey mist.  Trios of large candles on curved stands, flames aglow but grazed and occasionally extinguished by the mist's finger-like tendrils, have been placed near ample clothing for sale herein.  The path through the tent continues to the north."
