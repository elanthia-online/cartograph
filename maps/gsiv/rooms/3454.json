    "Three shallow steps lead from the street down to a low doorway at the side of a building, apparently the local armor shop.  Its crisply edged stucco walls have been painted steely grey, with faint traces of white and black accenting each swirl of mortar.  Inside a polished bay window are displayed several sets of armor, each designed to fit a diminutive frame.  A family pauses briefly before the statue of a halfling warrior standing opposite the door as the parents tell the hero's story to their children."
