    "Worthless bits of hide, stone, and crystal crunch underfoot with any step, and streaks of dried ochre powder stain the broken stone floor.  Fetid yellow smoke hangs over a half-congealed puddle of goo, obscuring the sight of a shattered rosewood cabinet.  Several torn parchment labels cling to shards of glass in the wreckage, but age has so faded the script that the labels are impossible to read."
