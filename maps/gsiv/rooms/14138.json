    "Yew saplings crisply define the exterior edges of the path here.  Closer to the gate entrance are stalks just barely the size of a halfling wrist, while the trunks closer to the north are thicker than a giant.  The care with which these trees are pruned suggest the fanatical devotion of the temple followers."
