    "A few small bats cling to the high ceiling of this room, waiting for the coming of night so they may venture out for their nightly forage of insects.  One or two of them peep quietly as you pass, but they remain suspended from their lofty perches.  The remaining bats seem blissfully unaware of your presence."
