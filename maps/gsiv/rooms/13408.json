  "description": [
    "Tall ebonwood trees line the western wall of the grounds, their dark leaves rustling quietly underneath shadowed boughs.  Clusters of jasmine, iris and stargazer lilies grow upon the deep green expanse of the grounds, each permeating the area with their distinct, pleasant perfume.  The cobblestoned path makes a sharp turn to the northeast, and the faint sound of sloshing water echoes amidst the surroundings."
