    "[Wrought From Rot, Nest]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Woven from rotten reeds and vines, then packed with leaves and grime, a massive nest is established between the thick, forked branches of the tree's largest bough.  Clustered branches and rotting leaves form a barrier around the nest, obstructing the view of both the ground and sky.  A faint, luminescent mold grows in spidery trails along the splitting bark of the bough and base of the nest, offering minimal visibility."
