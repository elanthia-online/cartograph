    "Backing the far wall, a sizeable white brick hearth is bordered by elaborate verdigrised bronze railings that span outward in an ostentatious display.  Several paintings, their subject matter well past the point of familiarity due to the apparent water damage they have sustatained, decorate the dining room, which, fittingly, is short a dining table and all but two wooden chairs.  Just adjacent a heavy wooden door is a tall curio cabinet on tiny wheels.  An intermittently stiff wind gusts through broken windows along the eastern wall.",
