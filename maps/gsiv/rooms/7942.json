    "A large horned owl circles overhead, headed for the tree to the east.  A few scratch marks in the dirt indicate that the bird may have been hunting here, but you see no sign of whether the prey was taken or managed to elude its captor this time.  Some stalks of the grass are shortened, perhaps snapped off by a sharp beak or teeth.",
    "A large black bird circles overhead, headed for the tree to the east.  A few scratch marks in the dirt indicate that the bird may have been hunting here, but did not dig up much of a meal.  Some stalks of the grass are shortened, snapped off by a sharp beak."
