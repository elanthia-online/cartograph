    "At the far end of the courtyard lies the archery range, where dozens of well-worn targets have been set into a section of the stone wall.  Near the practice area are a number of racks containing various bows and crossbows, and a small table holding a plethora of arrows and bolts.  Casting a long shadow across part of the area is a huge stone tower."
