  "description": [
    "This hallway is paved with pale gold flagstones.  Sunlight flows through the thick translucent quartz skylights above and reflects off the flagstones, bathing the white tile walls in an even, golden glow.  The west wall supports two large mosaics: a silver-framed panel with a silver plaque on it and a gold-framed panel with a gold plaque on it."
