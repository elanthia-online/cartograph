  "description": [
    "Overgrown with prying tendrils and tangled roots, the stream bank appears to have been rarely traversed.  The swift water bubbles and gurgles as it passes into the nether regions of the shadowed woods, relating the tales of its long journey from deep mountain crevasses to the silent oaks which border its shores.  A pale granite outcropping rises from the rushing waters midstream, providing dry passage for those who wish to reach the distant bank.",
