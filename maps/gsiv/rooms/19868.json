    "Botanicals, gems, liquids, and sundry animal parts cram the shelves of this tiny room.  Under one shelf is a table for sorting, while a tiny woman is barely visible behind a high counter separating the more expensive items from customers.  One tiny skylight provides some relief from the claustrophobic, crowded feel of the room."
