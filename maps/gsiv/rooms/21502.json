    "Roughly hewn walls of teak enclose the room, the darkly lacquered wood blending seamlessly against the stone blocks comprising the floor.  Dominating the western wall is a rectangular wood-framed painting hung low above a tiled slate fireplace, its screen wrought from iron and stylized with a large-muscled stag.  A cylindrical metal rack stands next to a tartan curtained arch leading into another room, the smell of cigar smoke and bourbon mixing with freshly burning wood.",
