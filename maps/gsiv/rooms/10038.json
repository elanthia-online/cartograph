    "A few spindly trees stand on the uneven, wind-scoured plain, their stark skeletons silhouetted against the rising mass of the old barrow to the north.  Broken, weathered chunks of granite and limestone lie scattered about the dark moor, amid hardy patches of brush and silvery tendrils of cold mist."
