  "description": [
    "A rocky wall rising from the sandy bay floor curves gently from the southwest to the north.  Clumps of knotted rockweed grow among the dark stones of the rock wall.  A mass of pale organ pipe sponges gives the rocky wall an odd-mildewed appearance.  Strong currents prevent swimming to the north or west."
