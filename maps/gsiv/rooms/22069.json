    "Rich cerulean carpeting covers the marble floor of this spacious office, contrasting with decorative molding of light golden wood.  Placed as the focal point, a large mahogany desk stands centered behind a matching armchair.  A towering bookshelf filled with various items rests against the back wall next to a tall window draped in sheer gauze.  Fashioned of cut-glass a protective case sits to one side, housing a beautifully crafted lute."
