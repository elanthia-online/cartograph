    "Visible through a large window set in the stucco structure to the south, the stall's contents consist only of rows and rows of buckets.  The buckets show off dyes that range from the lighter shades of orange to the darker shades of red.  Obviously too full, their contents have smashed together, causing some vials to shatter and send dye dripping down in haphazard patterns on the blue tile flooring."
