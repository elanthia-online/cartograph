    "The hearth room is dimly lit by brass lamps mounted along the dark mahogany walls.  A trio of deep blue cushioned chairs faces a grey sandstone fireplace in the corner, while a slate-topped bar runs the length of an entire wall.  A cluster of dark oak tables rests in the center of the room, not far from a brass archway."
