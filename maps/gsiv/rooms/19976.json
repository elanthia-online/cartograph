    "A winding path leads through this room which has been utterly transformed into the rocky terrain of a steep mountainside.  Perched on a nearby crag is a stuffed mountain ogre in a glass case, while on the opposite side of the path, a similarly protected humpbacked puma suns itself on a rock.  Watching all from the peak of the replicated mountain stands a lone mummified reiver.  The path leads through the mountain and down, leveling off before the next room."
