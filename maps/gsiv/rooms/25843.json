  "description": [
    "Two corners of the bedroom hold tall arched windows, and beams of moonlight give their nearly opaque surface an eerie glow.  Two ivory-hued candles rest upon a great ebony desk, their flickering flames casting shadows across its surface.  Warm light radiates from a row of glaes orbs set into the ceiling above, their luminosity revealing a wide lacquered bookshelf near a dark mahogany double door."
