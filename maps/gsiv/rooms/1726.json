  "description": [
    "The passage extends north and south.  It is flat and travel is easy but boring as the monotony of the walls around changes little.  The rock walls tower high enough that the positions of the stars are not readily discernible.  The wind obscures most sounds, but occasionally a howling unlike that of the wind's normal passage rises above the airflow's moaning only to subside slowly.  Faint markings are discernible on the eastern wall.",
