    "The old wood paneling has warped and shrunk, leaving long narrow gaps in the walls which glow with pale moonlight.  The sharp scent of polishing oil mixes with the dry odor of old leather in the still air, making the interior of the earthen-floor shed feel all the more cramped.  The feeble walls shake with every slight gust of wind, making the entire structure wobble unsteadily.  A dusty tool rack hangs haphazardly along one wall and an old plow sits discarded in a corner strung with wispy cobwebs.",
