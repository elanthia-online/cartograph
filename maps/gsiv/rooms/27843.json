    "Walls fitted with sturdy oak shelves, scroll tubes, and glass-paned display cabinets line the perimeter of this rectangular room.  An arched entry looms to the south, while a bas-relief of Fash'lo'nae and Lumnis face off against each other in the northern wall, engaged in a spirited debate.  Positioned directly in front of the carving is a gem-inlaid Elanthian globe.  Long tables and chairs line the center of the room, offering ample space for scholars and historians to conduct their research."
