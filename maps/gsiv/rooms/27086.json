  "description": [
    "Tree branches stretch over a leafy vine-covered arch, their laden limbs dipping towards the ground and nearly blocking the trail leading north.   An old wooden structure, savagely torn apart by the growth of several trees, dominates the western side of the forest.  Barely visible beneath the mossy vegetation, the remains of a door decorated with a violet sigil lies broken and forgotten."
