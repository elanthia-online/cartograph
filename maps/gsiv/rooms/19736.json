  "description": [
    "The stark white limestone walls of this small office brightly reflect the moonlight pouring through the windows and the light coming in through the northern arch.  A low bamboo table occupies the center of the room, and several bamboo chairs cluster around the table.  Two bookcases follow the eastern and western walls, while an arch cut in the limestone wall allows egress to the north.  The floor is barren save for a circular throw rug immediately below the table."
