    "Bits of faded, rotting wood litter the track, fallen from a trellis that has been consumed by the pale green honeysuckle vines that grow here.  Golden petals lay scattered about the ground, where they lay to rot in the hot tropic sun.  A thin track cuts through the thick tangle of foliage leading towards a small cemetery."
