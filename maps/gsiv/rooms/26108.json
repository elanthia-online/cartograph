    "A grove of old poplar trees lift graceful boughs in an attitude of spiritual meditation.  Cabins sit beneath the branches, graced by the eloquence of the trees.  The paths leading toward the buildings are carpeted in bright leaves, making the ways a patterned carpet of color, as subtle as it is beautiful."
