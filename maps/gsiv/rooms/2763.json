  "description": [
    "To the north, a band of broken stones borders the snowy plateau like a final break-water against the savage grip of the tundra stretching away to the northern horizon.  Snow and wind blast the rocks, leaving drifts in the lee of their southern faces.  Pine-covered mountains provide a backdrop to the south, misted with fog and snowy clouds that drift across the peaks like ghostly barges on a dark green sea."
