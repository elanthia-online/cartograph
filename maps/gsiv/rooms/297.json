    "This narrow alleyway passes crookedly between the old wood and stone walls of the surrounding buildings, providing a shaded byway from the busy road to the south to a small park nestled in a grassy niche to the north.  An occasional stray mutt sniffs around the foundations, searching for rats or morsels."
