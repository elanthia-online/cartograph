    "Glossy ice walls enclose the small room, while thick pistachio green woolen rugs line the floor, giving it a homely feel.  A grated fireplace sits to the east of the room, crackling as applewood smoke drifts lazily into the air.  Insets have been carved into the icy walls, their ledges holding dimly lit lanterns.  Several pine shelves line the walls, stacked with well organized books and scrolls, and a large oak table dominates the remainder of the room."
