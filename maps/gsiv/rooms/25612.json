    "Quietness and meditation prevail here in this simple room.  A mural on the eastern wall depicts the gods of light while the west mural is dedicated to the gods of darkness.  Chairs are arranged about the room so that one can rest facing one's particular deity.  Standing in a corner of the room is an altar of modwir wood with two fragrant candles at either end and a golden bowl in the center."
