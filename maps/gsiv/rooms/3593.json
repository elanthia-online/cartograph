    "The two rows of titanic slabs inhabiting the sleeping quarters leave little room for other furnishings.  Each slab could easily accommodate a large wagon, and fine glyphs skitter across their surfaces like a sorcerous dressing of bedclothes.  The ornament of carvings is fine and subtle, only evident at close examination.  An ora door at the room's end offers access to the hallway outside."
