    "Packing crate panels and other odd bits of wood pave the frozen ground, keeping the passersby from tracking mud into the small shops and stores that dot the landscape of Trade Alley.  A brisk business goes on between the customers and business owners, and even between the owners themselves, as no one lets an opportunity for dealmaking pass them by."
