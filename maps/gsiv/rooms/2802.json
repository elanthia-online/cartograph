    "One pine among the proud rows lining the path has succumbed to age and the elements.  It angles across the way, supported by its fellows on the facing row, creating a triangular door through which the trail passes.  The boughs of the crippled tree sweep down in elegant, needled swashes, as though they are appendages bracing the pine's slow descent to the ground."
