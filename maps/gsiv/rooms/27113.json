    "The vibrant plants and trees of the jungle provide an exotic background to the expanse of sand surrendering to the ocean's grasp as its foamy waves rush forth and retreat rhythmically on the shoreline.  A flock of pelicans gather upon a large boulder, only moving from their resting place to dive into the water and retrieve fish in their large gullets before returning to their perch.  Collections of seaweed cling to the debris cluttering the beach, and the cry of seagulls accompanies the crash of waves."
