  "description": [
    "To the west a massive gate stands open.  The gate is a full four feet thick and fashioned from iron-banded fel wood.  Four hardwood locking bars lean against the wall, their tops forming a stable platform for a sparrow nest.  Oddly, no signs of forced entry are in evidence.  Just inside the gate you see a stone ramp leading up towards the inner walls."
