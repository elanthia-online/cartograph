    "The misty path suddenly breaks free of the pale veil that covered it and gives way to a bright, sunlit field.  Colorful tents and pavilions fill the valley, their brilliant colored pennons fluttering in the air, crimson and gold to the west and sapphire blue and alabaster to the east.  A larger structure dominates the center clearing to the north.",
