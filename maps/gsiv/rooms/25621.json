    "Here, the Mistydeep slows its pace as it meanders through a quiet community.  Homes blend in with the surrounding foliage as if part of the forest itself.  Propped in the fork of a tree, a fishing pole leans out over the water, its line and cork float bobbing gaily in the current.  On the other side of the river, a pebbled shoal gives way to a marshy area where dragonflies dart about a tall stand of cattails."
