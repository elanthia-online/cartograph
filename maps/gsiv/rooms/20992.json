    "Three enormous windows surround a small walking space, while the final wall has an arch in it that leads to the second story landing.  Large bars prevent wild animals from finding their way into the building and also provide a modicum of protection against anything that might attack.  A low bench is positioned within the center of the room, but has been left largely unadorned."
