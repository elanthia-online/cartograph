    "A sudden twist in the alleys creates a natural dam as market-goers and residents struggle against the crowds to turn the corner.  Occasional exclamations of pardon or alarm echo from the buildings crowding in upon the street.  Three granite stones mark the center of the passage, their edges raised slightly to provide pedestrians with an additional challenge.",
    "Three granite stones mark the center of the passage, their edges raised slightly to create oddly shadowed bumps on the street.  Close-knit houses create a natural dam at this end of the alley where residents have strung clotheslines from the upper stories."
