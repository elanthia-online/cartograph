  "description": [
    "Much of the swamp appears to be undisturbed, as if the local wildlife is careful to avoid the area.  Uncomfortably humid even amidst the relief of a cooler evening climate, the air is still and heavy with the smell of stagnant muck.  Gangly trees extend twisted branches into the shadows, the arthritic limbs providing a surplus of perches for a sleeping eagle.  Hiding amongst the fronds of a lace fern, the pure white petals of a single daisy are almost obscured in the darkness of night."
