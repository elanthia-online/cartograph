    "Huddled along the ancient retaining wall that supports the Beacon Ring, numerous wooden shingled huts lean against the retaining wall and each other in varying stages of degeneration.  Here and there a fresh coat of whitewash, a peppering of unweathered shingles or a windowbox laden with bright blossoms attest to the existence of townsfolk who regard these sheds as their homes.",
