    "This promontory, formed of rocks and sand partially covered by weathered wooden docks, extends a short distance into the river.  A few workmen hustle to complete their nighttime tasks, repairing and refurbishing the sailing vessels that are moored here.  A refurbished frigate lies at anchor just offshore, awaiting a new cargo as well as a new lease on life.  The sand-covered riverbank beach stretches to the south.",
