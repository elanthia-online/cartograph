    "Mimicking the coloring of a sidewinder's skin, the gold-tinged stony floors are chiseled with an overlapping pattern of oblong keeled scales, occasionally punctuated with a gleaming ebonwood accent.  The rest of the corridor is empty, accentuating the dizzying effect of the precisely rendered design."
