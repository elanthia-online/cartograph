  "description": [
    "The expansive chamber is stark in both lighting and adornment.  A floor of pale sand offsets black walls.  Beams of light ricochet off the walls, although the source of the light isn't evident.  In the room's center, two altars sit opposite one another.  Behind them, carvings adorn the walls with scenes that are so old, their imagery is just ridges, gouges and basic shapes.  Frost rimes the edges of the carvings, adding a sense of antiquity to all."
