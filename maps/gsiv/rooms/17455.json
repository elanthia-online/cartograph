    "Crafted of sturdy canvas with solid oak supports, the tent's walls are lined with coarse linen woven in intricate black knotwork patterns and back-dyed in subdued hues of blues, greens, and reds.  A silver-worked modwir trunk holds numerous armbands, and a small tanik case displays various aemikvai."
