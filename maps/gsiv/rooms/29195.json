  "description": [
    "A buildup of yellow-topped foam does little to hide the bloated and mascerated bodies of dead fishes, floating belly-up among the rocky shallows.  While the pier above grants some protection from the winds, it also facilitates the pooling of the nauseating stench beneath the wooden structure.  Tracks of small animals abound here, marking this as a favored feeding area for predators and scavengers alike."
