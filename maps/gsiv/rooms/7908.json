  "description": [
    "Drakes surrounded by fluffy clouds are etched upon all sides of an elaborate fountain and basin that dominates the courtyard.  Rising from the center and spewing a continuous stream of water up into the air from its open maw, is a finely detailed bronze drake with outstretched wings.  Towering behind the fountain and flanked by two ancient monir trees is an expansive, ivy-covered manor house.  Polished wide marble steps lead to the opened arched doorway."
