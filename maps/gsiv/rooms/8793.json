  "description": [
    "A small courtyard is bordered on all sides by a high wooden wall.  Ivy covers much of it, the dark green leaves creating a dense cover which blocks out almost all of the noise from Wehnimer's busy streets.  Flagstones are set into a path passing under a lattice arch, which offers an avenue out of the picturesque enclosure."
