    "Filled with shelves of old books and diagrams of historical battles, this hall smells of dust and old parchment.  Illuminated by three narrow windows set side-by-side into one wall are several tapestries and frescoes that liven up the otherwise bare stone walls.  Providing a means of rest and relaxation, comfortable couches sit back-to-back on the varnished, oak-planked floor.  A polished brass plaque has been affixed to the wall.",
    "Filled with shelves of old books and diagrams of historical battles, this dimly lit room glows faintly by moonlight that filters through the windows on the far wall.  Tapestries and frescoes liven up the stone walls, yet the chamber smells of dust and age.  Providing a means of rest and relaxation, comfortable couches sit back-to-back on the varnished, oak-planked floor.  A polished brass plaque has been affixed to the wall."
