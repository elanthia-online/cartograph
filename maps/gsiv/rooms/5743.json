    "Along this quiet bend of the cavern, pinpoints of light are visible through the glass windows inset in the elegant facades of residents' homes.  Stone-lined paths break away from the main lake trail, leading to each polished front door.  Several tired-looking dwarves trudge past, on their way to a well-deserved rest."
