    "A few pear trees can be seen across a plush expanse of lawn bordered by marble statues.  An arched teak bridge crosses the fish-filled stream that winds though a variety of flowering plants and past a small dock.  Glass oil lamps sit atop ornamental iron poles.  Lovely carved teak benches rest beside each pole.  Some fieldstone steps descend into a rocky outcropping and a carved stone staircase rises to a terrace.  Honeysuckle vines run rampant over the rocks and an octagonal stone cabana house.",
