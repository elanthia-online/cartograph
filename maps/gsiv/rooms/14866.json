    "The bluff's elevation provides a spectacular panoramic view of the moonlit countryside.  Meadowlands stretch away to the east, and the indigo water of a lake mirrors the moons in wavering reflections.  A thick stand of pines scents the air with their pleasant aroma, and, underfoot, the ground is covered with a russet coat of their fallen needles.  The faint outline of a structure can dimly be seen through the trees to the northeast.",
    "The bluff's elevation provides a spectacular panoramic view of the surrounding countryside.  Meadowlands stretch away to the east, and the deep blue water of a lake caresses its shoreline to the south.  A thick stand of pines scents the air with their pleasant aroma, and, underfoot, the ground is covered with a russet coat of their fallen needles.  A structure of fieldstone can be glimpsed through the trees to the northeast."
