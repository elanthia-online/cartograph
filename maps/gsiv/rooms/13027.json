    "There is the slight tinge of a putrid rotting odor hanging in the air of this storeroom, but enough time has passed so that the smell is no longer offensive.  The floor is covered by trash and debris that reaches over a foot deep in some spots, but all of it is nothing more than unrecognizeable junk."
