  "description": [
    "At the bottom of the slightly sloped land, a narrow path leading inland converges on to the stretch of mud-embraced shore.  Black ash trees, their trunks as thin and spindly as spider legs, congregate in the shallow water with several pond cypress, where swamp ferns claw their long fingers at anything within reach."
