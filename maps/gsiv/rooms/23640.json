  "description": [
    "A large lighthouse lamp casing serves as a bay window at the front of the bar, light streaming through in the daytime to throw rainbows all over the room.  Oil lamps hang from the ceiling, creaking loudly every time the swinging doors that lead outside bang against their frames.  The back wall of the pub sports a long, highly polished darkwood bar, replete with tall bar stools upholstered in cheap red leather."
