    "The compartment of this small, white, egg-like device is just large enough for a single passenger.  Traveling in relative silence, as if thrown from its point of origin, the conveyance is completely opaque, except for a transparent panel in the floor.  Though thick and quite solid, the crystalline floor allows a clear view of the landscape below.  Affixed to the wall near the entry, a small golden sigil, made up of several conjoined gears, intimates gnomish origin."
