    "The broad sweep of the white tile floor is interrupted by an elegantly woven reed mat.  Halfway to the white stucco ceiling, a cracked ceremonial mask hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls.  A wicker basket and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
