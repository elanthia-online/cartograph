    "To the north, the ring of a broken tower blocks further progress.  To the south, the path leads toward a large marsh.  Burned and broken stone buildings are near the path here, and large mounds of earth and vegetation indicate where other buildings may have once stood, but are now long forgotten and hidden from sight."
