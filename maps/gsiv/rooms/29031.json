    "Exposed rafters are draped with long lengths of heavily dyed sailcloth in a variety of colors, the depth and grade of the dye highlighted by the plethora of frosted globes that provide illumination for the small shop.  Undyed bolts are neatly stacked along the western wall, while the eastern wall houses a floor-to-ceiling shelving unit laden with casks of various colored dyes.  A long white-washed counter, pristine and clean, separates the shop from an archway in the northern wall."
