  "description": [
    "A runner of thick, red woolen carpet follows the hallway to the north.  The runner covers the center of the red marble floor, providing a stable, soft, quiet area on which to walk.  Along the hallway, heavy golden velvet curtains allow entrance to private booths where one can access a personal locker.  Candles burn steadily in brass candleholders spaced evenly along the hallway's walnut walls, casting a dim but consistent illumination throughout the corridor."
