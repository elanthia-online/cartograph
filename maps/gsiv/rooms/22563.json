    "Several rusty iron buckets hang from iron spikes, which have been driven crookedly into the chipped limestone walls.  Bits of leather straps litter the floor, and broken pieces of shields lay heaped in the corners.  Half a dozen planks, likely salvaged from the black waters outside, have been nailed together over some spare crates to serve as a makeshift workbench."
