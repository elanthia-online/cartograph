  "description": [
    "Thick layers of vegetation cover the base of this steep, rugged mass of rock, making movement difficult over the hidden terrain.  Several trees with scaly bark stretch outward, leaning over the sharp descent to the forest below.  Only rare breezes blow through the area, giving an occasional moment's relief from the stifling heat of the humid forest."
