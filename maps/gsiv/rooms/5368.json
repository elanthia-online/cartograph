    "The ledge here at the mouth of the cave provides a splendid view of the valley below in all its mud-spattered, ill-smelling beauty.  The cave entrance itself is at least twenty feet high, and a dank, sickly-sweet smoke wafts from it.  To the southwest, a dimly lit passage leads deeper into the hillside."
