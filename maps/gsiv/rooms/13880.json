    "The tunnel widens into another of Cavernfast's charming courtyards, this one dominated by an exquisitely fashioned fountain.  Water arcs above a statue of a brace of fawns, falling over their slim forms and into a pool ringed by a mosaic-covered rim.  A glance into the pool reveals its bottom is covered with a glittering carpet of coins."
