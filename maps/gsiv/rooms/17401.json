    "Refined oak-paneled walls rise from an ash grey granite floor.  Just above a stuffed grizzly bear hangs an ornately rendered clan crest, and a dark and light oak ceiling completes the picture.  Some wrought-iron hooks and a hammered copper hanging rack stand side by side in the middle of the room."
