    "An enormous cast iron cauldron with thick, hinged ring handles dominates the training room.  Sturdy metal hanging arms attached to a trammel are positioned above the fire pit, ready to adjust the height of the cauldron.  Rough wooden stirring paddles, spyders, pokers, and hooks are neatly arranged along the wall, within easy reach."
