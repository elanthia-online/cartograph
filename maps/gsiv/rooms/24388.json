  "description": [
    "Beneath the shadow of the large hill to the northeast, the meadow spreads onward toward a large forest to the east.  A variety of wildflowers spring from the pale russet-hued long grass, the surroundings rippling every moment as each bends to the will of the soft breeze that rushes past.  A circle of trees stands in the middle of the field to the east."
