    "Several tapestries are displayed on the walls, each depicting one of the various gambling games aboard the Albatross.  Resting on each side of the rosewood door are a series of gold sconces, which illuminate the room.  Scattered throughout the lounge are a number of soft divans, offering a comfortable atmosphere."
