  "description": [
    "The wide cobblestone walkway splits into two as it encircles a small pond then merges again into a single broad path.  Though the pond is perfectly round, clusters of cattails and other tall grasses have been planted around its banks, and the pond itself boasts several clusters of water lilies, their colorful leaves and pink and white blossoms bobbing gently on the water's surface.  A small wooden dock stretches out over the water, and several fancifully wrought benches surround the area."
