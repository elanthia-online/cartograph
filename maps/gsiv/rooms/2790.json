    "The hall ends at the foot of an oak door, but branches to the left and right diagonals.  A second door to the right stands opposite a fine painting, depicting a strange, craggy mountain of seemingly pure ice.  The mount is surrounded by low, thick clouds, giving it a moody, introspective quality."
