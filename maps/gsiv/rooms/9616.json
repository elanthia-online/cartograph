    "Dimly glowing spots of light eerily light and fade away in the valley.  Dim moonlight reflects off of the snow-capped mountains to the north.  The cold wind whips around the mountains, raising the little dust that litters the ground.",
    "This part of the ledge offers a spectacular view of the top of the Dead Plateau which lies beyond the Glo'antern Moor.  A few lush green treetops poke through the mists in the valley.  The sounds of the dwarven settlement to the northwest echoes off of the solid rock walls of the surrounding mountains."
