  "description": [
    "The smell of roasting rolton hangs in the air.  An elderly elf checks on several pots placed in the ash of the open-hearth oven that is built into the north wall.  Near the doorway, a glaes-inlaid tanik larder cabinet has been set up to provide a resting place for the freshly prepared foods.  Empty buckets lie next to the cabinet, and large pots and pans are stacked on a nearby shelf.  A large table has been set up in the center of the room for the preparation of the day's meals."
