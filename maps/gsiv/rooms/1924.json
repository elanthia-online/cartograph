    "Heavy pieces of canvas stretch from floor to ceiling here, blocking any further passage to the east.  The tarps do little to contain huge puffs of dust that occasionally emanate from the other side.  The steady sound of metal against stone echoes from the other side night and day, slowing rarely.  Boards and tools lie scattered around the floor, each a potential hazard to those passing through."
