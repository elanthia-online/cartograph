  "description": [
    "The coatings on the beams have worn away in many spots, and several of the beams display ominous cracks.  The beams protest loudly when the rock above them shifts, and occasionally small showers of dusty particles rain down from the ceiling.  The air, somewhat stale and tinged with the odor of decayed flesh, hangs heavily in this section of the tunnel.  A metal sign affixed to one of the large stone pots sports bright red lettering."
