  "description": [
    "Woven reed baskets filled with spoils are strung from lengths of thick rope secured to rafters overhead, the aged wood carved with various marks and symbols.  A long counter constructed from an oak plank laid across a few overturned crates stands next to a heavy leather-bound trunk.  A collection of glass bottles, all empty and covered in dust and cobwebs, are lined up on the sole shelf mounted next to a sputtering iron lantern near a colorful twine hammock."
