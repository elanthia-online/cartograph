  "description": [
    "This rugged hilltop commands a sweeping vista of the whole of Vaalor.  To the east, the Mistydeep River winds like a silver ribbon past the citadel at Ravelin to the great city of Ta'Vaalor.  To the west, the distant, snow-capped peaks of the DragonSpine are nearly lost in purplish haze.  A sturdy fortress dominates the summit here, crafted from dressed stone and massive oak planks.  Clumps of sweetly scented delphinuris grow on dozens of earthen mounds surrounding the structure."
