    "The path narrows here, and beyond the edge lies a steep dropoff where tiers of hexagonal basalt columns present evidence of the dire consequences of falling.  Steam rises between the stone pillars in grey tendrils, the moisture collecting on the uneven rock face.  The bleached-white skeletal remains of a few sea birds scattered atop the black basalt columns have been picked clean and glitter almost picturesquely in the moonlight.",

Steam rises between the stone pillars in grey tendrils, the moisture collecting on the uneven rock face.  Black-headed gulls circle overhead, dropping shells onto the the broken basalt columns.  Their piercing cries dissipate in the wind as they dive to retrieve their succulent prizes."
