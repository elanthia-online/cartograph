    "Expanded in a large circle, the room is filled with stalls and cells with thick steel bars.  Chains and shackles hang from the walls in large quantities, while straw coats much of the floor.  At the center of the room is a large platform secured at the corners with massive chains, the device able to be lifted to the arena above."
