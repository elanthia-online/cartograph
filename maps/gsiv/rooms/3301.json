    "Passing through a blackened curtain, you enter a small bedroom.  Two large oak beds are set parallel to each other along the east wall with two dressers set on the opposite wall.  The fire in the common room keeps this room surprisingly warm.  The beds have seen some use recently but you can't tell if by man or beast."
