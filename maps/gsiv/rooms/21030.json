    "Reaching out over a sloping cliff is a triangular flat rock bearded with a layer of moist, green moss.  Looking over the edge, the forest below stretches out in full view with many unique rock formations jutting out of the green canopy.  The warm mist from the rainforest rises up with a hazy glow.  A grove of thick-leafed trees proudly display their bright flowers and sweet fruit."
