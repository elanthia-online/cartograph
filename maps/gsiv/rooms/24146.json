  "description": [
    "The narrow ledge is no more than a few feet wide, with just enough room to not become a victim to the depths below.  A wide crevasse leads toward a sunken tunnel, which can barely be seen from this distance.  To the west, a massive waterfall pours out from a breach in the wall."
