    "The towering city gate looms above, its massive edifice built from thick blocks of pale ivory limestone.  Intricate carvings adorn the blocks, each depicting various scenes of battle and occasionally a representation of Koar or Eonak.  City guardsmen flank the gate's opening, inspecting each entrant into the city's vast interior.",
