    "The large table in the center of this room is designed to serve as a funeral pyre.  Used to cremate bodies, the table has been somehow crafted to withstand extreme heat.  Stacks of wood and urns of oil line the back wall.  The ceiling of this room slopes upward at the center forming a flue that sucks air and smoke up and outside."
