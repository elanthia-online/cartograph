    "At the northwest end of Sandstone Avenue, a local sculptor donated his time and carved four busts into the wall at the end of the passage.  Four kobold faces peer out at passersby, one of the heads wearing a set of spectacles, another sporting a bit of a hooked nose, the third with a regal look on his face, and the last with a long lion's mane of hair.  Small children climb in and out of the hollowed out ear of one of the middle carvings."
