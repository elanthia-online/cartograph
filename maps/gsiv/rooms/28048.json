    "Maroon canvas covers the ceiling and walls of this roomy tent.  An oaken shaft rises from the straw-covered dirt floor upward to hold the tent's frame in place overhead.  In the rear of the tent, a workbench can be seen covered with wood working tools and rough wood poles ready to be transformed into jousting weapons.  Finished lances rest horizontally along a rack that stands before the central pole."
