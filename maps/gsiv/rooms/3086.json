    "Scrapes and scratches have been gouged into the flagstones paving the road's surface by the deep digging of the heavy snowplow.  Tall evergreens mark the boundaries of the street, with lengths of icy chain between them serving as fences.  Thick smoke curls up from chimneys, adding to the grey clouds hanging low overhead."
