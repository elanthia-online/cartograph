    "Golden glass covers everything, creating the illusion of inclusions in amber.  Beneath the glimmering surface are books, scrolls and other containers for knowledge, trapped for all time by the razored shards.  A large branch grows through the hole where the window once sat, raining pine needles down over the room."
