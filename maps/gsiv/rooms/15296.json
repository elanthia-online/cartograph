    "Beneath a vaulted polished teak ceiling, an ivory inlaid gold-framed portrait hangs on one of the polished ebonwood-inlaid oak walls.  A burled maple-inlaid ebony bar and an elegant ebonwood armoire swept with crimson brushstrokes sit in opposite corners while a tightly woven oval red and gold wool rug rests on the black marble floor."
