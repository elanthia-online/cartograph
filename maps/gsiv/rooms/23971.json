    "Disarray and dust aptly describe the interior of the abandoned house.  What furniture remains lies up-ended and covered in a fine layer of filth, the sole exception being an oak writing table situated near a window that gazes out to the southwest and the rest of the old port.  Vines invade the house, reaching in through broken windows and wide-flung doors, as if the wilds outside are determined to overcome all trace of habitation."
