    "Atop this gigantic tree, an oak platform has been constructed.  A colorful array of flower petals is scattered over the floor, occasionally whirling about the air whenever a gust of wind rushes through the tree top.  Spread about the platform are several benches, providing ideal locations for contemplation and reflection.  Near each bench is a handcrafted wicker basket filled to the brim with petals."
