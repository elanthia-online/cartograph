    "The wood-and-stone walls of a sizeable town rise before you.  Mail-clad dwarves pace atop them, looking over your head up the canyon.  The road enters the wide-open gates.  Dwarves, giantmen, and burro-drawn carts pass through them into the bustle of the town.  The river flows north through a gap in the walls to the west.  Several squat barge wallow their way upon it.",
