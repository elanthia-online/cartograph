    "Hanging over the northern horizon of Liabo like a bright blue and green jewel, Elanthia sits with swirls of puffy white clouds dancing across her surface.  The startling radiance of the planet's larger than life presence keeps at bay much of the enveloping darkness of the space beyond the protective, azure-energy dome.  Several steps in the golden tile pathway descend towards a glass-lined sunken ring."
