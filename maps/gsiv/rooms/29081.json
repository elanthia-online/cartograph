  "description": [
    "Mounted taxidermy trophies encircle the rough oak walls, and the ears, horns, and antlers brush against the rafters that support the copper tile roof.  Stretching from one wall to the other, a long golden linden bar occupies a majority of the pub's available space, leaving very little room to maneuver around the cushioned bar stools.  A series of shielded lanterns help to dispel the dark caused by the lack of windows, though a general dimness prevails."
