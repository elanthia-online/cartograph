  "description": [
    "Several crates are piled against the walls, bits of straw poking out from between the misaligned slats.  A straw pallet lies on the floor, the area surrounding it cleared of the sprockets and cogs that are scattered about the small space.  A small mobile, consisting of gears suspended from a series of wires, hangs above a squat steel door and idly twists with the slightest of movements."
