  "description": [
    "Rolling hills spread out and away from the ledge to the east, rising in height into a single ridge.  From this vantage point, looking north spots the Tempest River forming a boundary along a great valley teeming with an uncountable number of trolls.  Flames are scattered amongst the trolls, from great bonfires that send plumes of smoke up into the sky.  Situated across the small opening at one end is a defensive line of Torren guardsmen, occasionally set upon by random enemy forays."
