  "description": [
    "Three panels, two vibrantly tiled murals and one devoid of art, occupy the eastern wall, while the western wall has a bas-relief garden of herbs, plants, and flowers carved into its slightly curved surface.  Arranged in a neat row down the center of the corridor is a series of votives, their brightly burning wicks offering ample illumination for pilgrims as they make their way from the downward spiraling stairs to the upward ones, and back again."
