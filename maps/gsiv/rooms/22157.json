    "Stacked haphazardly about the room, trunks, crates and other storages boxes stand in an unorganized pile.  The layers of dust indicate that the items have not been needed for some time.  Several pieces of furniture are covered with white sheet, the various shapes hiding their identity underneath.  A slightly open window gives a view of the front gardens and the town of Solhaven."
