    "A large fireplace occupies the center of the room's southern wall.  It appears that no fire has been lit in it in some time, since there are small pale mushrooms growing across the hearth.  Aside from the fireplace and its resident fungi the room is empty.  Two boards missing from across one of the room's eastern windows let a fair amount of starlight into the room.",
