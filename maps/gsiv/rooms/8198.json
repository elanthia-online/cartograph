  "description": [
    "This chamber is vast, and the far walls are barely visible in the flickering light from the fire-pit in the center.  A ring of spears surrounds the fire, each topped by a small, fanged skull.  A wide passage leads off to the north, and there's a small opening low on the eastern wall."
