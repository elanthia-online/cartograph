  "description": [
    "Brass sconces are hung upon the oak walls of this windowless room, their soft light filtered through the frosted glass globes that rest upon them.  Velvet upholstered chairs are situated to either side of a low oak table, which is covered with a pale blue linen cloth and a silver serving tray.  Opposite the table setting is a colorful mannequin adorned with swatches of vibrant fabric and flanked by a pair of linen-lined bookcases displaying multicolored bottles, jars, and vials of dyes."
