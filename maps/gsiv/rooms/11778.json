  "description": [
    "Low dark shapes break the surface of the swamp for but a moment, then slowly descend and vanish into the depths of the gloom.  Some of the shadowy forms look to be quite large, but thankfully, none of them appear to be heading for the shore... yet.  Whatever they are, they evidentally aren't worrisome enough to keep folks from building a shack or two along the shoreline."
