    "The interior of the small bungalow is awash in peculiar smells...sour stinks, sweet aromas, sharp odors, oily scents, metallic effluvia, fetid reeks.  Shelves of potions in odd-shaped jars and phials line one wall.  The doors of a large cabinet are ajar, providing a tantalizing glimpse of elixirs, nostrums, amulets and periapts."
