    "The narrow stone passage is lined with several openings.  A half-collapsed passage, and a twisting side tunnel lead off to either side, while a stone opening and a rusted metal drainpipe stand at each end.  Oddly, the space is dimly lit by stumpy candles resting in sconces that line the stone walls on both sides of the passage.  A single high shelf adorns the stone wall between two such sconces.",
