    "Cracks spiderweb through the floor of the plaza as if an immense object impacted the stone.  Overhead, one large stalactite looks like a broken fang, a jagged chunk missing from its tip, but there is no sign of the absent chunk.  The plaza ends, but a thin lip of raw stone stretches toward the south."
