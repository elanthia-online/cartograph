  "description": [
    "The walls of this small cabin are made from hand-carved golden oak.  Polished cedar and mahogany trim adds character to the otherwise simple appearance.  A small fire burns within a rough granite fireplace, the half-consumed logs filling the air with the pleasant scent of applewood.  Dozens of candles rest atop a large wooden table, a small apple crate, and some golden oak shelves.  Moonlight streams in through the cabin's single window, bathing the room in a pale silvery glow.",
