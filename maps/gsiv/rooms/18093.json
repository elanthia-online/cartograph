    "Filling most of this inner sanctum is a pallet, swathed in soft bedding and heavy with overstuffed cushions.  Candles of red and white burn steadily, pooling molten wax into small silver dishes and casting flickering light on the knotted back of a suspended silk tapestry and a polished silver mirror."
