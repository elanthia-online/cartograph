    "A wheelbarrow filled with ore separates two miners engaged in a heated debate.  Their faces are covered with soot, and their beards are so full of the dark silt that one good shake would create a dust storm.  The argument is in the dwarven tongue, but the word \"elf\" is repeated often, and not in a very pleasant tone."
