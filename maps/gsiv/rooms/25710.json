    "Large and wide, the leaves of the mangroves provide an organic barrier to the nightly winds of the harbor.  Moonlight trickles through the wide branches and pools in pockets upon the manicured lawns of the island, creating shadows where the silvery light is unable to penetrate the foliage.  A series of terracotta pots, filled with several varieties of anemones, line a slender path which provides safe passage the between island's dock and a sprawling villa."
