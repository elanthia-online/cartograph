    "A glaesine-topped tanik workbench dominates the cramped laboratory, one end pushed against the wall so it is beneath an octagonal window.  Atop the window-side of the workbench rests a complicated, platinum gem lens assembly.  A glass alembic and a star-carved, black marble crucible also congregate upon the workbench.  Scorch marks mar the white marble floors, and a curtained arch leads southeast to the main hallway.  Shadowed by night, a winter rose bush sits in the lone, unscorched corner.",
