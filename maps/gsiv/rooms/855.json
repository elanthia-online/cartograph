    "The gentle gurgle of a nearby mountain stream does little to distract you from the rigor of the climb along this stretch of tundra.  The pollen from a small field of goldenrod, devalued to silver in the moonlight, tickles at your nose.",
    "The bright sunlight reflecting off a nearby mountain stream blinds your eyes but does little to warm your bones.  A small field of mountain goldenrod beckons like the wealth of kings."
