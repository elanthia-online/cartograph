    "A wide avenue of packed snow reaches from the mountain slopes down to a low ridge of rocks to the north.  Broken branches and boulders stick up out of the snow here and there, mangled testimony to the violence of an avalanche.  The low susurrus of rushing water creates an undertone to the howling and fussing of the wind."
