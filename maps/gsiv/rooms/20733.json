    "Nearly spilling over their knee-high granite borders, beds of colorful flowers of myriad varieties line a cobblestone pathway leading to a pair of rustic ironwood doors, the entrance to a large, granite-faced lodge.  The lodge's upper floors of massive, rough-hewn oak logs sport small balconies backed by large sheets of glass.  Hedges of laurel and boxwood march across the building's front.  Their branches, while not blocking the views from any windows, have an air of wildness about them."
