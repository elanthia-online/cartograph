    "Surrounded by a pale grey stone wall, the cobblestone courtyard of the carriage house fans out in semi-circular pattern with the focal point leading to a white paneled house.  To the other side of the building is an archway that leads into the stable.  Pots of blooming flowers are set about decorating the area with their bright colors."
