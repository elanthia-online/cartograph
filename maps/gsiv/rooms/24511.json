    "The atrium is tucked into a hollow at the center of the building, forming a pocket of shelter surrounded on all four sides by walls of white stone.  The brittle stalks of dead Vines wrap and wind around the legs of a pair of marble benches, and threaten to choke the base of a stone socle.  Above, the view of the sky is unobstructed.  Above, the view of the sky is unobstructed, though the light of several alabaster-shaded lanterns casts a glow that hides all but the brightest of the stars."
