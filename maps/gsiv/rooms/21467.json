    "A myriad of ropes and pulleys have been strung from the tent's framework in order to support an extensive rhimar contraption.  The icy temperatures within the tent cause your teeth to chatter.  A pile of shiny red sleds rests near a blanket of snow, offering a place to sit and admire the workings of the contraption.  Icicles cling to a tent flap that provides the only way to escape to warmer climes."
