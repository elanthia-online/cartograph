    "Discarded bottles and lost baubles decorate the tangled bushes that line the edge of the clearing, their smooth or rough edges catching enough of the ambient light to cause it to reflect through the canopy above.  Thick clusters of fuzzy green moss occupy most of the ground, though the western edge is decorated with scattered groupings of grass and wheat.  A pair of oak planks head toward the midway, its edges caked with mud.",
    "Discarded bottles and lost baubles decorate the tangled bushes that line the edge of the clearing and hold court around their glassy lord.  The assortment of trinkets and glass is arrayed around an enruned shadowglass obelisk in an almost reverent display, their smooth or rough edges catching enough of the ambient light to cause it to reflect through the canopy above.  Thick clusters of fuzzy green moss occupy most of the ground, though the western edge is decorated with scattered groupings of grass and wheat."
