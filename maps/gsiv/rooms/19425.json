  "description": [
    "A huge room spreads out to the north.  Pillars set in the marble floor rise to support the glass ceiling.  Stations have been set up next to each pillar, and training in martial arts, weaponry and bodybuilding occupies each station.  Several sets of sandbags huddle next to one nearby pillar.  Huge iron pipes glow redly, radiating moist heat into the room.  Small trees in wooden planters break up the white monotony of the marble floor, pillars and ice-encrusted glass."
