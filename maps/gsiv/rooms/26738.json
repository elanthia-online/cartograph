    "Departing from the plateau above, a twisting and twining path descends towards a tangle of thick, new-growth foliage comprised of knotted vines and rope-thick creepers.  Bands of mist slip through the area, tumbling like dark clouds and pooling in thick banks towards the vegetation below, making it difficult to see with any certainty what lies within.  A cluster of decaying wood that is riddled with dried-out barnacles darkens the eastern edge and blocks all passage deeper into the jungle.",
