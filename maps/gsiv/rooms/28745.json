    "This cavern serves as a casual gathering place as well as a work space for the militia.  It is cozy and comfortable, with some plush chairs strewn about the space in a somewhat haphazard manner.  In one corner is a large desk which can be used for daily paperwork or reports, or for strategy meetings.  A wide tunnel with the militia crest mounted on the wall above it leads back to the Great Room."
