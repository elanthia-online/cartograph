    "The top of the ridge provides a decent view of the Khohallatain Forest to the south.  The woods are a mass of dark grey growth, and the varied heights of the trees create a rippling effect.  The Locksmehr River winds southward until it disappears from sight, blocked by rows of trees that stand taller than your present position.  The trail delves into the forest to the east, becoming quickly obscured among the tightly clustered trees.  In the other direction it winds down the ridge to the southeast.",
