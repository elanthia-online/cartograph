    "Small boulders litter the base of the cliff and dark crags are visible along the cliff face.  Stars wink in and out of existence in the night sky and small critters scurry between the boulders.",
    "Seagulls perch in the crags and on small boulders in and near the cliff face, watching travelers warily and taking to flight when approached.  Crows sit atop the cliff face, vying for position with the larger seagulls in the crags."
