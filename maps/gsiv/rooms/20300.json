    "Fetishes and totems dangle high in the branches of the stately water oaks.  Bundles of incense and herbs with charred edges have been laided out in orderly arrangements atop flat rocks placed in circles.  Grim-faced statuettes, lit from within by blood red candles, rest upon each rock, as if guarding the half-burnt offerings.",
