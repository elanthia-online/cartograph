  "description": [
    "A vast lagoon of brilliant blue depths stretches out before the tumble of water rushing down from the plateaus above.  The bi-level falls are surprisingly quiet as the water cascades from its lowest outcropping to feed the pool, and the ripple of the liquid curtain only partially conceals the shadows of a cave beneath the ledge.  Plumes of mist rise into the air constantly, casting glistening dew upon everything within close proximity."
