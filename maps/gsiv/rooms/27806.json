    "A low-set round table spreads across the surroundings, its edges bordered by billowing tapestries traced with delicate silvery designs.  A variety of high-backed seats padded with velvet are placed around the table evenly, their surfaces stained a deep crimson.  Twisting feystone-chased candelabras are positioned throughout the room, casting a pleasant, flickering light throughout the large chamber."
