    "Thin air in this high altitude takes its toll on body and mind.  Shadows resolve themselves into dark, sinister objects against the mountainside, while the moonlight dancing off patches of pristine snow makes the patches appear to pulsate and undulate with lives of their own.  Moist breath quickly coalesces into fine, icy particles that cling to faces, beards and hoods.  It is so cold that spit freezes with a crackling sound before it hits the ground.",
