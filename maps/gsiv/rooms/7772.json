    "An expanse of grassy meadow stretches before you, a lake of green bounded by grayish firs.  Bright golden butterflies flit among the flowers that dot the grass.  A pile of churned earth to one side marks a gopher's back door.  A trail winds through the trees to the northeast, and curves around to a gentle climb up a hill to the southeast."
