    "Blocks of ice fill bins on either side of the narrow chamber and keep the dressed deer carcasses hanging from the ceiling cold.  Water trickling from the bins as the ice slowly melts drains into a small hole in the center of the floor, leaving the limestone floor slick.  A pair of mallets near the door stands at the ready to break up larger blocks of ice when necessary."
