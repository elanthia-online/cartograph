    "Ancient blue spruce trees and bristlecone pines give way to clumps of tanik, creating a shadowy presence in this section of the thick forest climbing the ridge along Whistler's Pass.  The silence is omnipresent, broken only by the lone hoot of a saw-whet owl.",
    "Ancient blue spruce trees and bristlecone pines give way to clumps of tanik, creating a very cooling hue in this section of the thick forest climbing the ridge along Whistler's Pass.  Birds call out from their tall perches up in the canopy and the ground cover growth rustles now and again as chipmunks scamper about."
