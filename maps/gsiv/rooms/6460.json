    "Though there is no door to shut out the world beyond, a feeling of utter tranquility envelops you here.  The soothing reminders of the forests are everywhere, wrapping you in a blanket of calm and serenity.  Heavy woven rugs cover the floors, and nestle against walls lined with polished mahogany.  In the center of the room, a simple stone altar rises up from the midst of a tiny garden of carefully tended, sweetly scented herbs.",
    "Though there is no door to shut out the world beyond, a feeling of utter tranquility envelops you here.  The richest colors of the forests are everywhere, wrapping you in a blanket of calm and serenity.  Heavy woven rugs of dark green and brown cover the floors, and nestle against walls lined with polished mahogany.  In the center of the room, a simple stone altar rises up from the midst of a tiny garden of carefully tended, sweetly scented herbs."
