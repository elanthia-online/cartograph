    "A silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the white silk-paneled walls, and a sturdy bamboo-rafter ceiling rises overhead.  A wooden ship's wheel sits in one corner of a colorful mosaic floor.  There is a long mistwood counter on one side of the shop and a floral-etched ceramic case on the other."
