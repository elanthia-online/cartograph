  "description": [
    "A moonlit patch of daffodils rests beneath the star-filled sky, where a bend in the river forces the muddy trail to veer inland.  The gentle breezes that carry through the area bear the flowers' subtle perfume, mingled with the stronger fragrance of pine that wafts down from the ridge.  A pestering cloud of gnats fills the air, their incessant droning buzz signaling their intent to strip the skin from your bones.",
    "A cheerful patch of daffodils basks in a sunlit meadow, where a bend in the river forces the muddy trail to veer inland.  The gentle breezes that carry through the area bear the flowers' subtle perfume, mingled with the stronger fragrance of pine that wafts down from the ridge.  A rabble of butterflies fill the air, their bright red and yellow markings a sharp contrast against blue sky and green forest."
