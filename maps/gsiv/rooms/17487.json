    "The prisms from a multifaceted crystal chandelier, which twirls gently from the chains that secure it to the ceiling, clack together and create a melodious jingle.  As the crystal prisms spin overhead, light catches and reflects like sunbursts from the numerous brass plaques that hang at regular intervals throughout the chamber.  Delicate crystal decanters in various shapes and sizes adorn the mantle above the fireplace."
