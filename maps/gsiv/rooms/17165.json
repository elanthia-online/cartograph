    "Granite steps lead underground to this cold, dimly-lit room that has a cavernous dark stone ceiling with redwood rafters.  Just alongside a brass-hinged modwir treasure chest, a series of oak wine casks are laid out in rows upon a wine-stained pale green limestone floor.   A gilded grey ash framed painting hangs alone on richely polished driftwood walls inlaid with blue-speckled sea glass.  Tucked away is an old lobster pot, which sits forgotten in a corner."
