    "Jutting up from the ground, limestone foundations are topped with only the edges of what was once a thatched roof remain overhead.  Pieces of a broken table and shattered glass lie on the floor, scattered near the ladder leading down.  Arranged on a small ledge in the wall where several stones are missing are a wire brush, a comb, and a set of shears.  Blue and white-striped silks, brightly lit by a multitude of candles on the floor, are hung over the doorway in a festive manner.",
