    "This corner of the wagon has been obviously graced by a woman's touch.  Gleaming, flora-scene pierced screens square to create a separate area within the large wagon.  Ecru lace curtains frame the wooden windows, and a woven tapestry rug sits in the center of the room.  A large wildflower bouquet lends a light fragrance to the air."
