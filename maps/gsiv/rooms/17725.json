    "A large flat area extends to the northwest populated by majestic oaks and stately magnolias.  Training areas have been cordoned off to allow instruction in weaponry, defensive maneuvers, and various forms of bodybuilding.  Several sets of heavy sandbags cluster under a nearby oak.  Although most of the area appears dry and firm, the footing on a nearby leaf-covered patch appears less than trustworthy.  To the northwest, two figures stand as if awaiting the arrival of someone."
