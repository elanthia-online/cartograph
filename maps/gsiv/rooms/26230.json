  "description": [
    "Only a few scorch marks mar the splintered cedar planks of the walkway, whereas beyond to the north and west, the devastation is total.  Black water covers half of the planking where the charred supports have partly collapsed into the surrounding swamp.  The blackened branches of once lush vegetation makes for tricky navigation in the dim moonlight."
