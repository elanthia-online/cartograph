    "An oak of wide girth, its trunk a stony grey hue, rises from the thick forest undergrowth, its skeletal branches oddly absent of leaves.  Its once sturdy bark has turned brittle, flaking off in long strips which litter the path.  Short stubby branches extend from the trunk in a seemingly intelligent pattern, almost appearing as footholds for ascension.  A heavy odor, like the scent of moist earth in swampy regions, pervades the area."
