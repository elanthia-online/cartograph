    "A white ivory altar stands to the south, set upon a circular tile of lapis lazuli that emanates a faint glow from the reflected sunlight streaming through the thick icy walls.  A subtle border of daggers alternating with owls is engraved upon the floor, following the circle in a gentle spiral.  The statue of an athletic elven woman is situated behind the altar, her form slightly shadowed by the niche of ice arcing over her.",
