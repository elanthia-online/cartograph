  "description": [
    "The modest backroom area of the cabin is painted a pallid lunar blue hue and is outfitted with a wide glass window, giving the limited space a much larger feel.  The weathered room is chiefly empty, save for a stately silver-bound chest that is propped open by a primitive glaes dagger."
