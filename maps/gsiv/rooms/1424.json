    "The stone walls of Vornavis's Northwest Tower loom above as the cliffs fall away beneath.  The sensation is dizzying.  Just below, the first in many courses of Solhaven rooftops begins.  A strange contraption of ropes and pulleys is attached to the stone wall.  A metal track, newly set into the cobblestones, runs down the steep hillside."
