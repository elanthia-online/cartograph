    "Broken pieces of rock crunch underfoot at the base of the passage, but, as the tunnel rises to the northeast, the hard fragments give way to the distinctive streaks of a broom's passage traversing mining dust upon the stony floor.  Twin burning torches shed brilliant yellow light at the top of the passage, and a massive pair of blue mithril doors set between the torches blocks access to whatever lies beyond."
