  "description": [
    "Twin stakes are driven into the hard, dark stone of the plateau, which rises many spans over the boggy floor of the cavern.  They anchor a vine-covered wood suspension bridge that sags between the plateau and another, slightly higher, in the distance.  Vines entangle the guide ropes to either side of the bridge's rickety planking."
