    "A cool breeze blows through this covered patio hedged with fragrant rose bushes.  Tall stone columns support the roof, each with ivy twining up its base.  Benches of black granite have been set around the patio, and an ebonwood trellis draped in blue wisteria vines arches over a dark slate footpath.  The light of the night sky casts a gentle luminescence on the a small pond at the path's end, and thriving flower beds abound in this quiet area."
