    "An underground river runs through this natural cavern, which has been enlarged and beautified by the stonecutters' work.  The water enters near the ceiling and cascades down a rippled ramp.  Reforming into a rushing stream, the water runs back and forth across the room in a series of channels cut deep into the stone until it crashes against a black marble wall, throwing up a tremendous mist.  The water collects in a large pool at the base of this wall."
