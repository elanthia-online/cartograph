    "The patio is enclosed by a wicketed colonnade of black granite supporting a gently sloped portico of crimson-stained glaesine tile.  Patinated copper balustrades line the spiral staircase and second story gallery, with a frosted glass panel sided by many windows, lain open to capture the breeze.  Wrought iron chairs with velvet padding are set throughout the spongy creeping thyme groundcover, the earth speckled in motes of dusky violet and lemon yellow.  Across the way, a white gravel terrace surrounds an octagonal cerulean mosaic pool and its copper maiden water feature.",
    "The patio is ringed by a wicketed black granite colonnade, each set with lanterns that cast wavering shadows across the ground.  Dense layers of creeping thyme encroach upon the white gravel terrace where several wrought iron chairs with velvet padding are positioned around an octagonal cerulean mosaic pool featuring a pale green copper maiden sculpture.  Placed back from the tile roof of the veranda, a patinated copper balustrade lines the spiral staircase to a second story gallery, its frosted glass panel entry and many windows enshrouded in curtains."
