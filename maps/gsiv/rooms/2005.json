    "Underfoot, the ground is springy and yielding.  Down beneath the heavy fog, a carpet of mushrooms grows between the trees, shining with a faint luminescence in the night's shadows.  The thick mass of branches and vines all but obscures the moons, and from every direction, the sonnets of tree frogs fill the air.  The dark moss covering the trees gives them a regal air, like the velvet lining of a noble's cloak.",
    "Underfoot, the ground is springy and yielding.  Down beneath the heavy mist, a carpet of mushrooms grows between the trees and in every direction, moss covers the trunks of the majestic mistwoods.  The thick mass of branches and vines all but obscures the sun, and the warm fog forms glistening droplets of dew on every surface.  The glossy moss covering the trees gives them a regal air, like the velvet lining of a noble's cloak."
