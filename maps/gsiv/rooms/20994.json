    "Wide windows decorated with sheer gauze curtains surround the room, while squares of buttercup yellow and cobalt blue tiles create a checkered pattern upon the floor.  Positioned to face the windows and the oak-framed arch, a large ebonwood desk sits kitty-corner to the solid walls of the office.  Maps, diagrams, and bulletins decorate the teak-paneled walls beneath the guarded light of several copper lanterns."
