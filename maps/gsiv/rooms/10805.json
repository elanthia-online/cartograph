    "Oak branches, heavy with their load of crackling leaves, crisscross overhead, forming a thick canopy.  Thin slivers of pale light filter down through the layered canopy, illuminating tiny sections of leaf-strewn undergrowth.  The ancient path, checkered in silvery moonlight and dull blackness, winds its way among the silent oaks.",
