  "description": [
    "Halfling merchants wander up and down the road here, hawking their wares.  A low wooden building sits to the side of the road, decorated with banners in a rainbow of colors, each declaring it a general store.  From inside, the hustle and bustle of feet can be heard, punctuated by an occasional shout as items are bought and sold."
