  "description": [
    "Roots snake across the path in a every direction, a tangled net eager to trap the feet of any passer-by. The hulking shadow of a root bound boulder sits brooding by the side of a fork in the path.  Small fireflies flitting over its crenellated crown give it the look of a small granite fortress guarded by fairies.",
    "A large patch of shriveled vegetation is encircled by a guard of blackened tree trunks.  The tallest of the trees has been split in two by the lightning bolt that scarred its neighbors.  Half the trunk remains standing while the other half rests, twisted and rotting, in a cradle of burned out undergrowth."
