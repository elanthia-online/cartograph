    "A huge banyan tree has been made to provide the ceiling and walls that enclose the well-lit shop.  Moonlight streams in through the gaps left between many of the trunks, each fitted with a sinuous piece of glass that blocks inclement weather.  Thick, mossy turf provides a cool green carpet under your feet, broken by two small clusters of stiff and fibrous vines.  One is grown into a humanoid shape and serves as a mannequin while the other has become a flat-topped pedestal."
