    "Sequestered from the main garden, the orchard accommodates four black trees, a dead white tree and a rotted dead white tree split down the middle far from the platform edge and a tall wall of woven roots.  To the left of the nearly mature trees and in front of four rows of stakes, small black saplings splay out of the soil at peculiarly bent angles.  The handful of tiny wispy white strands of light floating over the other side of the platform seem to avoid wandering anywhere near the orchard, effectively couching it in a perpetual crepuscule."
