  "description": [
    "Giant blue-speckled toadstools cast a cheerful light over the wide walkway, and a cluster of gold-hued moss clings to the iron columns on either side.  The faint aroma of loam hangs lightly in the air, along with a trace of fragrant cigar smoke.  An inscribed marble tablet marks the sandstone-inlaid path heading towards an immense granite edifice."
