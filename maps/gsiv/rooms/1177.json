    "The bluff protrudes out from the forest causing the river to bend sharply around the outcropping.  From this vantage point the river stretches out for several miles each direction, winding between the forest sections.  In some places it churns and whirls, adding whitecaps to its surface only to calm down and become more peaceable in other sections.  Boulders dot the water in many areas, and often piles of rubble lie strewn in the water below the bluff's face."
