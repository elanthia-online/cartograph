    "Sturdy, black granite forms the back wall housing the bank's vault, which has a brown-clad elven guard standing next to it.  A long oak counter with two tellers at their windows sits before the vault.  A dozen glaes globes hang from the ceiling, illuminating the entire room with green-hued light."
