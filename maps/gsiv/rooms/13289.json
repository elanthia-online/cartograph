    "Several mortars and pestles sit on small round tables, their grinding areas stained with color.  Gnomes sit at some of the tables and use the tools to grind barks, flower petals, and other raw materials into a paste.  Tall jars of alcohol diluent sit on shelves lining one wall, while the opposite wall holds a sluice and sink.  Bright white orbs hang pendulously from the ceiling."
