    "The cramped area at the rear of this caravan has a single cushioned folding stool positioned in front of a wall-to-wall oak counter spread with organized boxes of wares.  Above the counter is a recessed alcove stocked with bits of chalk, a spool of measuring cord, and a pinking iron.  A miniature silver crown chandelier is suspended from the ceiling on a short chain, casting flickering candlelight on a collection of rose pink silk pillows."
