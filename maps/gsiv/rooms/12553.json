    "The trail winds along the south side of the ridge, curving through patches of sparse trees and shrubs as it follows the curve of the canyon wall.  Small sand-colored lizards scurry along the nooks and crannies of the stone wall.  The gates of Kharam-Dzu are visible through the trees some distance to the south."
