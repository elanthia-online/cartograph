    "This rustic room is a cozy retreat from the Great Room.  The worn modwir floor is covered haphazardly with fur rugs and fluffy pillows made from the hides of creatures native to Wehnimer's Landing.  The rough-hewn walls are covered with a multitude of portraits, sketches, and hand carved graffiti.  In the center of the room, a ring of comfortable modwir armchairs surrounds an immense riverstone fire pit.  Scattered rays of moonlight filter into the room through a round pane glass window that glimpses out onto a leafy forest glade.",
