    "A crimson gate bearing the silver clenched fist of Kai stands open to Eastbridge Lane, large guards standing on either side of the gate carefully scrutinizing all who enter.  A path of pale marble stepping stones leads into the temple grounds, bordered on both sides by pairs of large, sturdy oak trees."
