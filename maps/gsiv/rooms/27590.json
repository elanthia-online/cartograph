    "Above a messy wooden workbench, salty fog enters through the back window until heat from a lantern's bright flame makes it cling as droplets to the half-circle wall of reclaimed maoral.  Though the stone floor inside the knotty pine half-door looks recently swept, you feel the grit of sand beneath your feet.",
    "The half-circle wall of reclaimed maoral glistens with condensation from salty mist finding its way in through the back window, below it a messy wooden workbench.  A hastily swept stone floor is still gritty under your feet, as sand has inevitably found its way inside the knotty pine half-door."
