    "A stand of oaks, stark and grey-limbed but bejeweled with scores of diamond blue icicles, shelters a small fountain and the pond that it feeds.  Lifeless beneath the glaze of ice and rime, the fountain awaits the resurrection of spring.  The main walkway continues southeast toward the peak-roofed silhouette of the temple, but a narrower walk splits off and heads south through the snowbanks."
