  "description": [
    "A walkway curves around the massive slab of ice crouched in the center of the nave, its crown hidden in the shadows of the tall, arched ceiling.  Where the flagstones meet the formation's foot, the rocks are cracked, yet they still retain their uniform plane.  The sculpture changes as the walkway circles it, transforming from a single drake to the contorted forms of two of the great beasts in flight.  Their bodies are twisted about each other, with only the four grand wings free to maintain flight."
