  "description": [
    "A noticeable contrast to the front room, the walls and ceiling are planked with care, thick oak muffling every sound.  A pair of sputtering torches illuminates the area and casts dappled shadows across the room, while clothing hanging from a metal block and tackle sways with the gentle rocking of the ship.  A driftwood display with a trio of mounted fish hangs on the wall above a gigantic oyster, its upper shell stuck open."
