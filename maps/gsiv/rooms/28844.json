  "description": [
    "Torches light a noisome, boggy grotto.  Thick vines choke the walls, fleshy and fibrous, unhealthily pale from a lack of nourishing sunlight.  Wooden planks are raised out of the muck below to form a walkway, but it is an uncertain thing, most of the wood succumbing to some degree of decomposition.  Some lichen-clad dark wooden docks stretch out over the banks of the nearby river."
