    "Sitting against an immense marble column is a circular glass-topped stand illuminated from beneath by a glowing orb.  A few shallow niches have been carved into the wall in order to house tiny copper-brushed censers.  The fragrant and pale smoke from the burning incense drifts lazily through the air, creating lacy patterns that soon dissipate."
