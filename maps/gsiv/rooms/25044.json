    "The broad sweep of the hardwood floor is interrupted by a thick off-white carpet.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls.  A series of low oak shelves and a flexible willow woven basket are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
