    "Shallow veins of quartz crystal line the rough-cut walls here, where the stone was obviously not gutted out to make way for any long-term mining operation.  Several areas of the cavern are so completely lacking in smooth areas that the rock rises out of the walls to create natural, table-like surfaces and flat shelves."
