    "Textured ivory silk walls rise from a parquet golden oak floor.  Just above a serene golden wyvern fountain hangs an intricate knot-worked wall-hanging, and a maoral beam ceiling completes the picture.  A twisted dark metal rack and a carved mahogany box stand side by side in the middle of the room."
