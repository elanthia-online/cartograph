  "description": [
    "The sound of rushing water nearby fills the area with a gentle natural murmur.  Trees, shrubs, and lichen struggle among the crags for footing and their very survival.  Cut into the natural stone of the cliffside, a narrow path leads up the mountain while a steep trail leads further down the rock face."
