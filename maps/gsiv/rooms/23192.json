  "description": [
    "This cozy lounge is furnished with several comfortable leather couches and matching armchairs, on which are scattered pillows woven of soft silks dyed in the muted amethysts, azures, indigos, and aquamarines of the sea.  A matching carpet softens the red sandstone floor, its dense pile luxuriously resilient underfoot."
