  "description": [
    "Dim moonlight filters in from above, barely illuminating the area.  It is clear, however, that each wall of the cavern is spliced with thick veins of serpentine.  A thin coat of serpentine dust covers both the ground and the vines that hang down through the overhead crevice.  Lack of light makes further progress into the dark cavern impossible."
