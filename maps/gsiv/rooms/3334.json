    "A staircase hangs on for dear life to a rare two story building, many of its steps broken out by the constant weight of the snow constantly piled on it.  Most of the bolts holding the carpentry together have rusted away, leaving a few bits of over-stressed metal to do the work of the missing parts.  A sign blocks off the bottom of the incline, warning of the danger obviously awaiting to befall a careless climber."
