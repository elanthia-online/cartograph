    "A peacock feather fan hangs on one of the smooth white plaster walls, and an oak-framed ceiling rises overhead.  A bathing maiden statue sits in one corner of a golden blonde oak floor.  There is a long brass clothing rack on one side of the shop and a Vornavian silk-lined display case on the other."
