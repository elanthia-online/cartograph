    "The faint, tangy scent of the bay mingles with the lighter smells of the river, which runs just to the northeast.  The wide road leads along the riverbank through the warehouse and wharf district, where the sounds of longshoremen loading and unloading freetraders drift over from a wooden walkway to the east."
