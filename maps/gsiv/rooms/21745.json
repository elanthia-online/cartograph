  "description": [
    "The natural springs surrounding this dock start off shallow, but quickly turn deep at its very center.  All around the edges of this small dock are spots to stick a fishing pole, and a weatherbeaten driftwood bench rests at the far end, closest to the deepest part of the spring.  Protected from the elements, a small fire burns, remnants of previous fish fries evident all around it."
