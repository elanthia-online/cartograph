  "description": [
    "A small, cozy office is set off from the rest of the dorter by a plain spruce door.  Other than a small silver snowflake charm hanging above the portal, twined with a bit of wild rose and sweetbriar, the chamber favors function over form.  There is a neatly kept writing desk and no chair, and the desk's letter trays have but a few pieces of parchment in each, as if the occupant fastidiously tends to incoming and outcoming work."
