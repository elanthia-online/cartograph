    "The main trail begins to climb, riding up alongside a shallow gorge.  Thick metal handrails follow the sides, offering a handhold as well as some protection from wandering off the edge.  Hard-packed ground, made from red dirt and small pinkish rocks leads the way upwards towards a tall, spiraling tower."
