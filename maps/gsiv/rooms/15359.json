    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a pile of striped throw pillows.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls.  A flexible willow woven basket and a vine-carved mahogany table are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
