    "This corner of the workshop is far darker than the others, and a musty smell suffuses the area.  Sounds are muffled here, as the plethora of books and tomes act as dampeners for any echo they encounter.  Bookshelves sag under the weight of various tomes, a desk is piled high with scrolls, and various crates lining the floor are stuffed full of paper.  There's a layer of dust over most things, though the sheer amount of books and various tomes makes this area feel rather crowded."
