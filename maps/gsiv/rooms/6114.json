    "Rubble from the collapsed eastern wall litters the ground while the rockslide rises over two hundred feet up the eastern end of the canyon.  The wall beyond the rubble is extremely jagged and appears to be unstable as small rocks are constantly falling free and joining their predecessors on the rockslide.  To the north the eastern branch of the twin canyons works its way around the rock outcrop that splits the pair, while to the west jagged rocks jut up amidst a covering of eerily dancing mist and steam.",
