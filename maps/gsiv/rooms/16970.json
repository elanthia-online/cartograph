    "Thin rivulets of russet-hued earth flow around you, the curvy channels formed from the translucent crystal walls.  A grouping of thin pillars whose interiors roil with dark, bubbling mud are positioned at the far wall, their surfaces incised with flowing patterns contrasted with straight, angular designs.  Faint bubbling noises echo through the room, the percolations rebounding off one another to form a light, airy melody."
