  "description": [
    "The musty stone corridor ends here at a sculpted black vaalin arch.  Nineteen small crystal globes run the length of the arch, casting an eerie blue tint over everything in the room.  From the north, a faint breeze rushes in, causing the dust on the floor to swirl to life for a moment before settling back down between the cracks in the stones that line the floor.  An open doorway stands to the east."
