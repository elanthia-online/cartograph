    "Elegant beeswax candles hang from the ceiling in hunter green glass holders, their light dappling the richly carpeted hallway and casting shadows along the rosewood walls.  Solid gold frames a heavy door at the end of the hallway, and silver filigree outlines another on the port side.  A heavy, richly appointed tapestry muffles the sounds from the bar down the hall."
