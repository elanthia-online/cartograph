  "description": [
    "Lacquered dark walnut flooring stretches out from the kitchen and across the neatly manicured grass of the hilltop.  The large deck is built to incorporate a narrow brook that runs down the hill to the beach and blends with the sparkling surf of Lake Eonak in the distance.  Thick, dark forests ring the lake, framing its pristine beauty against the backdrop of the Reach's majestic peak.  Several low teak chairs with elongated seats sit snug against the house.  A sliding glass door leads into the kitchen, while a narrow set of stone steps leads down the hill to the beach."
