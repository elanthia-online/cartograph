    "Whoever lives here seems not so much to scorn privacy as to be completely unfamiliar with the concept.  Communal satin cushions and fur throws are strewn haphazardly on the floor in lieu of beds.  Inspirational tapestries flank the arched rosewood door to the south, while a pair of mirrors on the east and west walls reflect soft moonlight into every part of the chamber, leaving nowhere to hide."
