    "The tent is musty and smells of animal fur and raw meat.  The walls are black, partially discolored in some areas, the fading portions mostly concealed by large wooden statues, each one carved to represent a growling bear.  A burly dwarf with a tangled red and black beard stands behind a stained oak counter, periodically checking his teeth in the reflection of a nearby display case."
