    "The trail abruptly arrives at the edge of a V-shaped ridge several yards high.  The sparse forest crowds the edge, but even with the exposed roots of the trees there seems no good way to descend to the forest below.  The gurgling sound of a creek seems to come from off in the distance to the north, and the trees appear to thicken in that direction.  Scattered elms hold their ground up here against the encroaching scrub grasses."
