    "Rich lacquered walls arch overhead, each trimmed neatly with strips of mahogany.  Dark red velvet drapes from the ceiling, collected in elegant, deep folds to impart a cozy, relaxed atmosphere about the area.  Several oil lamps sit in recessed niches in the wall, lending a soft amber-hued glow to the surroundings."
