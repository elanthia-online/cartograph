    "Verdant green borders contrast with the white gravel of the path.  The dense green-black of jungle growth looms to the southwest.  Occasionally the distinctive chattering and calls of primates echo through the air.  A wide open space, the colors indistinct in the moonlight, can be glimpsed to the northwest.",
