    "Bolts of fine red velvet have been hung from each corner of this shop, their material flowing haphazardly down onto the floor.  The scent of freshly tanned leather assaults your senses as piles of inventory are neatly arranged behind their various displays.  Along the far left wall, sits a lacquered fireleaf stand, and along the far right wall, sits a gnarled haon display table.  Closer to the entry way resides a large ebonwood stand and an velvet-lined display table.",
