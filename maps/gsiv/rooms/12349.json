    "The warm, sweet aroma of baking bread and delicate pastries wafts through the quaint bakeshop, inviting browsers to partake in the enticing goods sold here.  Silvery moonlight filters through a pair of glaes-paned windows, and a pair of decorative brass sconces hold glowing candles that help to illuminate a counter crafted from highly polished birch.  An open archway behind the counter leads to a partially obscured backroom, from which a mixture of pleasant, sugary smells emanates.",
