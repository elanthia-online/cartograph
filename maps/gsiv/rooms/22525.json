    "Earthy and lightly fragrant, the woody decor provides a perfect interior for this modest greenhouse.  A light coating of rich chestnut earth hides the floor, and variegated ivy has been cultivated to creep up all four walls.  Stretching across the room, a lacquered faewood pole, secured by braided ropes, is suspended from the ceiling and displays a vibrant collection of hanging plants.  A diminutive iron wheelbarrow is stuffed with various gardening items, and a wooden shelf is lined with soil-filled pots."
