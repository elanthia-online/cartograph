    "The natural canopy parts in this small clearing, just wide enough to see a sprinkling of stars in the sky above.  A plume of smoke, faintly illuminated by the fire that gave it birth, rises from the chimney of a tiny stone cottage that rests within a high wall at the edge of the clearing.",
    "The natural canopy parts in this small clearing, just wide enough to see the sky above.  The faint smell of wood smoke lingers in the air, mingling pleasantly with the light fragrance of grass and wildflowers rising up from the earth.  At the edge of the clearing, surrounded on three sides by a high wall, is a tiny stone cottage."
