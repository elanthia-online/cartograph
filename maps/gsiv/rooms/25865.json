    "Centered in front of a circular stained glass window, a high-backed leather chair rests behind a mahogany desk crowded with letters and empty teacups.  A sparrow trills inside a brass filigree cage prominently displayed atop a bookshelf, the leather-bound volumes within embossed with gold lettering on the spines.  Across from an arched opening, an illuminated globe of Elanthia casts a radiant blue light across the pale white marble floor."
