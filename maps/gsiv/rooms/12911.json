  "description": [
    "The sound of violently rushing water is somewhat choked by a thick, dark forest to the east.  Animal cries echo from the woods from time to time, piercing the still air with high-pitched shrieks.  A perfectly set stone path leads from the western portion of the road to a well-maintained brick house, along with a small shed and barn."
