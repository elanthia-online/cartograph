    "The string of torches continues northwards, filling the tunnel with a continual shifting play of light and shadow.  The roughly hewn walls of the tunnel, still bearing the marks of shovel and spade, occasionally jut out further into a passageway, offering any absent-minded explorer a potential knock on the head.  Sand has collected at the base of the walls, and the miniature dunes are covered in a series of small rodent tracks."
