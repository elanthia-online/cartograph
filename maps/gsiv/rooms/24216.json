    "The walls are almost completely covered trying to hide the decrepitness of the structure, but cracks in beams and holes in the wall can still be seen.  A variety of colors can be found in the stacks of bolts, from the bright greens to vivid reds and touching upon every shade in the rainbow.  Some crates sit in front of a large sales counter piled full of different clothing being offered up for sale.  Near piles of materials a wooden ladder sits in the corner extending upwards to the next floor."
