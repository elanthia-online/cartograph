  "description": [
    "Ivory-swept dark grey silk walls wrap around the semi-circular nook area, providing a pleasingly stark backdrop for a pewter-set ivory stand and a beveled ironwood sideboard.  Tiny clusters of silvery lights are suspended in a gentle wave configuration from the ceiling, illuminating an ornate willow receptacle resting in the middle of the room."
