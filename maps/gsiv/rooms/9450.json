    "Formed from unadorned grey stone, the corridor is neat and tidy.  The smooth stone floor meets the walls in a single seamless line that is echoed by the gentle curve of the high ceiling.  Standing open at the far end of the corridor is a pair of invar double doors, their stone casing carved with gentle whorls and slashes."
