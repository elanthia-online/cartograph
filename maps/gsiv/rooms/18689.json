  "description": [
    "A wide stone staircase, laid with a sapphire runner, descends to the herringbone-patterned dance floor.  The arched opening at the top of the stairs sits well beneath the ceiling, with its elaborate silver-ribbed fan vaulting, though the staircase itself is not steep, but merely a long, gentle incline.  At the far end of the ballroom, high up, the heavy stone wall is cut away in favor of a series of stained glass windows.  A few silver-gilt chairs and tables rest under the blued lunettes.",
    "Laid with a pure alabaster, a wide stone staircase, descends to the herringbone-patterned dance floor.  The arched opening at the top of the stairs sits well beneath the ceiling, with its elaborate silver-ribbed fan vaulting, it is not steep, but merely a long, gentle incline.  Bright silver and gold streamers drape down from above, their lengths adorned with crystal droplets.  A few silver-gilt chairs and tables rest under shimmering translucent draperies of silk that billow down the walls."
