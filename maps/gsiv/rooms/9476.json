    "Unmarked crates line the wall opposite a small doorway, beneath a series of stone shelves.  A dwarven assistant occasionally meanders in to sort and inventory the wares.  The lone illumination for this small room is a luminescent toadstool standing in the corner, its mottled cap just barely touching the ceiling."
