    "Looking forward from the quarterdeck rail you can see the shattered mainmast lying across the main deck and the splintered starboard bulwark.  The masthead reaches down to the reef below.  A hatchway leads into the officer's quarters.  A short flight of steps leads up to the poopdeck and a narrow companionway ladder leads down to the main deck."
