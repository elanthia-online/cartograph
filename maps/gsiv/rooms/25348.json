  "description": [
    "The monochrome interior of the tower is stark, a landscape of greys accented only occasionally by any color.  Over the room's only window, bundles of drying flowers - roses and violets darkened and crinkled with age - are strung from knotted lengths of twine.  Elsewhere along the walls, pressed herbs dwell behind glass framed by ebonwood filigree, and antique side tables flank an arsenic grey velvet-cushioned couch with a high back and sculpted arms.  On one of the tables sits a spindly black-limbed tree, and beneath it is a blackened green abalone shell.  Propped on the other table is a framed black vellum scroll scripted in silver ink."
