    "Thick animal skins cover the modwir floor making a soft carpet that muffles the sound of footsteps.  Several crystal lanterns hang from poles that help to support the large pavilion, their bright glow illuminates the velvet shrouded alcove.  A trio of mannequins stand in the center of the room, their slender forms display various garments, jewelry, and weapons."
