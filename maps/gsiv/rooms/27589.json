    "A raised rocky platform against the far wall is layered with ragged furs, blankets, and threadbare pillows, while a fraying rug covers the stone floor off to the side.  The walls are utterly bare save a pair of niches, one on each side of the crevice, that house small, hovering orbs of violet."
