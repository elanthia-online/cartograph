    "Moonlight illuminates a large bay window, casting shadows on the floor near a glass-paned door.  Several decorative woven grass mats hang on the walls, while a white wooden door stands beside an oak-framed painting depicting a jungle landscape.  Rustic wood flooring stretches from wall to wall, uninterrupted save by a low driftwood table that rests between two fluffy couches.  An oil lamp on the table sheds honey-colored light on the room, throwing the corners into shadow."
