    "Loud voices haggling in both dwarven and elven accents emanate from a nearby warehouse.  Cartloads of fresh vegetables, slightly frozen in the wind, sit in front of the warehouse, collecting snow on top of their foodstuffs.  Several more warehouses line the roadway.  From the words written on their neatly lettered signs and the goods piled out front, many deal in foodstuffs, lumber, ore, clothing and salt.  The entire area has the look of a freight transit center."
