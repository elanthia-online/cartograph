    "The floor drops off practically from beneath your feet, plunging into a dark chasm.  The wall opposite the ledge on your side is a sheer, unbroken expanse of stone, plunging straight down into the fissure.  Water drips from stalactites in slow, steady drops, and a plopping sound echoes from the chasm."
