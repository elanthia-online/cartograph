  "description": [
    "Stretching to the east and south, the walls in this portion of the long hallway are painted a pale sky blue.  In the center of the floor stands an ornately detailed sea nymph statue on a carved lapis lazuli and jade base that resembles an ocean wave.  Hanging on the wall is a cedar-framed dark watercolor seascape, an onyx-framed landscape painting, and a monochromatic ink stipple drawing.  Crafted of pale green sea glass, several oil lanterns lend their subtly tinted light to the room."
