  "description": [
    "An assortment of metal tables are scattered across the room, some of them burdened with a number of tools, including bone saws, metal clamps, knives, and stakes, while others laden with vile chunks of flesh and various organs.  Wandering the lair is a one-eyed goblin scavenger, hunched over with a twisted expression on its face.  A pile of rotting carcasses lies in a heap against the western wall."
