    "Serpentine gold-scaled dragons flank the sides of a large pool bubbling with heat stretching across the room.  Rearing out of the watery depths is a glittering drakes head statue, its maw open to gush forth a huge stream of steaming hot water high up into the air and back down with a splash.  Lustrous marble columns ringed with silver leaves mark the edges of the circular pool, their surfaces trailed with tiny droplets."
