    "This small clearing behind the tent is bordered on one side by the tent wall and on the other three by tall reeds and grasses.  Several gum trees tower over the area, and strands of moss drape down from their branches like living curtains.  The ground is hard, with exposed sand and limestone peeking through the peat.  The scent of decay is heavy in the air, and the moonlight does little to brighten the area.",
