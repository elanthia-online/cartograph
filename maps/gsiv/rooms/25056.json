    "The ashes blowing away from the smoldering cooking fire collect along the blood-soaked stones encircling the center of the camp, covering the rocks in layers of dark soot.  Plates and cups sit untouched against heavily notched logs, the food rotted away or dragged off into the unknown.  Several instruments sit ruined amongst the cutlery, crushed beneath both hoof and foot."
