  "description": [
    "Despite the half-rotted condition of the rest of the ship, the captain's quarters have been remarkably well kept.  Polished cherrywood paneling lines the walls, and a decadent mahogany desk is prominently featured in the center of the room.  Heavy, uncomfortable-looking, hand-carved chairs have been positioned in front of the desk.  An iron-banded mithril trunk is positioned against the back wall, and the wooden door leads back to deck."
