    "Rows of widely spaced perches and the faint scent of rotting meat would give name to this low structure's purpose, even if there were not nearly a dozen merlins, kestrels, and larger hawks resting upon the high poles.  A far wall is studded with pegs, each one hung with the finely crafted bits of leather that serve as jess and hood to a hunting bird.  Bars of sunlight slanting through the high narrow windows appear almost solid with dust from the hay-strewn floor."
