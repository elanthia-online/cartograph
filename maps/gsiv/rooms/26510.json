    "Swathes of silvery sea silk are draped from sunbleached driftwood branches forming an open-air pergola.  Moonlight filters through a tangle of verdant vines and tropical blossoms woven throughout a trellis overhead, the salt-scented breeze creating an intoxicating aroma as the sea air rustles the fragrant petals.  Wares are sorted into wicker baskets, and wooden trunks are thrown open, displaying the goods within.",
