  "description": [
    "The north end of the wagon has been painted in vibrant pink shades, with vases of tulips and purple lilacs precariously balancing on ledges and small tables.  A row of over-plumped modwir chairs sits in the far corner, topped by numbers of multi-colored cushions of various shapes and sizes.  A set of makeshift wooden racks and a tall wicker basket have been propped up in the middle of the room."
