    "The oversized scale of the wagon persists even in this section of the wagon, clearly the front most compartment set just beneath the driver's bench.  Scalloped swags of beaded silk fringe decorate the step-cut ceiling at the far end, while a profusion of brass lanterns hang overhead to provide copious amounts of light.  Along the outer edge of the space, several small sofas and chairs have been placed, while an oval table occupies the heart of the area."
