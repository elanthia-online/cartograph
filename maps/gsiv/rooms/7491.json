    "The air is almost oppressive in this narrow, lichen covered tunnel.  Passing through, you constantly check to see if anything is following, as clawing and scraping sounds echo down from the tunnel toward you.  Just ahead, the passageway begins to slope downward, and the dripping water from overhead flows down in a westerly direction."
