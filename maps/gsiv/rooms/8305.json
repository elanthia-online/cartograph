    "This hut bears the signs of recent habitation.  A smoky fire smoulders in a small firepit, which holds the remnants of a charred joint of bear meat.  The floor is covered with the bones of various game and small animals, but some of them appear to be suspiciously humanoid.  A few clay pots, filled with viscous, noxious liquids, are arranged around the room."
