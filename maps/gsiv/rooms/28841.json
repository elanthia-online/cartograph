  "description": [
    "Dense stone walls curve to cut off the path leading from the decaying nearby village, but the path is undeterred.  It proceeds eastward through a narrow passageway that is lined with oily, gnarled torches.  Currents of air waft from the tunnel like heavy breaths, and carry a fetid odor of sodden earth."
