    "Torchlight reflects from the surfaces of chainmail and plate adorning stands spaced across the armory in a mock formation, the burnished armor magnifying the room's radiance.  Along the walls, teak shelves store a wealth of weaponry ranging from daggers to mammoth greatswords.  Sharp scents of metal polish and old metal war pungently in the air."
