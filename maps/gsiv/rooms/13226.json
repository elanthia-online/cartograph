    "On this side of the temple, tall hedges ring a small prayer garden, and white marble benches are scattered here and there for private moments of quiet contemplation.  Pink water lilies float in a small pool next to a slate path leading behind the temple.  A wooden gate leads to the esplanade, while an arched modwir door leads into the temple."
