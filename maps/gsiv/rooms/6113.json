    "Turning to the south, the canyon follows the outcrop that separates it from its western twin.  Visible in the distance is the southern junction of the canyons at the base of the southern canyon wall.  Rubble piles along the eastern wall show signs of very recent additions and join with a huge pile of rubble further south in the canyon.  Barely visible above the rim of the canyon, The Krag's snow-covered peak appears like a pointed diamond set in the silvery night sky.",
