    "To the east, the thick blanket of fog traps the land under its white, unmoving canopy.  To the west, the Dead Plateau's interior stretches away in a maze of cracks and crevices across an unnaturally flat expanse.  Before you, the hard stone trail follows the plateau edge.  Behind you, the hard stone trail follows the plateau edge.  The sameness seems to stretch forever, and the cold, dry wind follows you, adding to the monotony with its constant rising and ebbing wail."
