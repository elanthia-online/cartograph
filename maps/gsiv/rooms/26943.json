  "description": [
    "Large and small blocks of granite transition from rose to crimson within this small chamber, the gradient hues becoming pale enough to be nearly white in one section, while the opposite section is nearly black.  Star-shaped stained glass lanterns dangle from the ceiling around a golden linden spiral staircase that leads both up and down.  Beneath a southwestern-facing window, a cushioned bench of sanguine and mauve provides a comfortable resting place."
