    "Wooden panels provide smooth footing for the tavern, and rows of large kegs line both sides of the room.  A circular red oak bar rests in the center of the parlor, its surface cluttered with a number of refreshments.  A black bear skin rug covers an area of the floor, right below a carved wooden dart board."
