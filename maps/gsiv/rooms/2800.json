    "A large stone cuts the path in two, its surface mottled and dark against the background of misty snow.  Lichens trace a pattern of fancy lace over it, as delicate and fine as the flakes of snow powdering the rock.  The canopy of trees is especially thick overhead, as though they are grouped above the boulder like a curious crowd of giants."
