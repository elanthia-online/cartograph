    "Loaves, cookies, pastries and cakes crowd the display cases, and the scents of spices and oven-fresh goods fill the air.  The worn oak planks of the floor and the ivory patina of the plaster walls suggest that this is a business of long standing in the port, while the faint trail of floured barefoot prints to and from the kitchen door attest to the natural talents of the staff.  However, it also leaves room for speculation as to how many items never reach the display case."
