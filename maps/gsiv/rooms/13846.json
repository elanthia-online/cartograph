    "A low-roofed passageway hewn from solid rock twists quickly out of sight.  Braziers wrought of mithril shed pools of light in the gloom, while curiously they emit no smoke.  The walls and floor are quite uneven, however, the surfaces are satiny smooth to the touch as if each one has been polished with care."
