    "The cobbled road girds the town along the inner side of the northern palisade.  Just to the north stand the twin sentinels of the gate's guardtowers, silhouetted against the night sky.  Guardsmen come and go through the main gates, keeping a close eye on the people of all races who move to and fro.  Opposite the gates, you see the shop of Dakris the Furrier.",
