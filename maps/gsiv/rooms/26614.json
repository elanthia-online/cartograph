    "Set below the frayed rope bridge is a still basin of water, the liquid casting mirrored reflections of the teeth-like stalactites that barely puncture the surface.  Concretions litter the water's edge, the small pearl-sized matter scattered between what appears to be submerged skulls of unknown origin."
