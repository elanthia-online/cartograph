  "description": [
    "The cavern floor slopes down to a sluggish subterranean stream.  Scintillant insects dance above the water's surface, their reflections dim as if the surface of the water were coated with oil.  The stream's bank looks wide enough to follow north, but a rockfall chokes off the southern passage along the water."
