    "A stand of aspens surrounds a fork in the trail, the trees making a soft murmur as breezes pass through their silvery-green leaves.  A cluster of dwellings can be seen to the south, grouped around the edge of a bluff.  To the northeast stands another steep cliff, its face marked by stone steps and its crevices and cracks filled with wild orchids and ferns.  The crisp smell of wood smoke fills the air, curling up from the stone chimneys of nearby homes."
