    "A cacophony of insect sounds permeates the air, creating a melodic symphony of cheeps and chirps throughout the forest.  A small stream has wound its way down the mountain and cut a path through the forest here.  Several large stepping stones jut up from the water, making crossing the stream an easy event."
