  "description": [
    "The air in this grubby run-down pub is thick with the scent of old ale, and the floor is sticky with it too.  The tables are little more than old beer kegs, and the seats merely smaller casks dropped next to them, but it matters little to the rough and hearty crowd.  A surly matron mans the many taps behind a rickety old bar, while a young boy excitedly dashes between her and the tables to take and fill patrons' orders."
