    "Chilling breezes pass through the area, rustling the piles of dead leaves that have formed drifts against the rampart wall to the east.  Tiny sprouts of spring green grass push their way through the leaves, a visible symbol of the renewal of life.  A small ebonwood plate stands in the center of the path, mounted on a stand shaped to resemble a double-arched black gate.  A single silver rattles in the bowl with every gust of wind."
