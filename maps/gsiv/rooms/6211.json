    "The tunnel narrows as it continues forward, and the air becomes less stale.  The path transforms slowly from unending darkness and rough walls and flooring to a dimly lit, cobblestone trail.  The walls are crafted from sandstone blocks, and the remains of murals and tapestries hang from its height."
