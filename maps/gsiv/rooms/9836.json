    "Tiny, delicate fern fronds push through the rich soil of the path, their tips curled into exquisite spirals.  High above them giant ferns spread their broad arms, dew still sparkling on each dimpled leaf.  Startled by a sudden noise, an intensely green tree frog leaps from a nearby frond and disappears into the undergrowth."
