    "Figurative patterns created from multicolored tiles form a mosaic on the floor.  Colors in all shades of the rainbow illustrate a scene of a male aelotoi dressed in a crimson tunic as he bows gracefully to a woman seated on a sapphire throne.  Tucked in the corners of the room, elaborately carved ebonwood tables flank the arched doorway that leads deeper into the building.  Decorating a large oval-shaped window, delicate lace curtains billow gently on a breeze."
