    "The sweet aromas of pineapple, coconut, and other tropical fruits lazily caress your senses.  Standing near a heavy driftwood table, a cheeky brunette barmaid casually toys with a bottle in her hand while waiting for a group of contestants.  Beside the table, a carved wooden sign hangs neatly on the wall."
