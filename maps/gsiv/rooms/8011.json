    "From a narrow crevice at one end, this cave opens out into an immense echoing distance.  A pale cadaverous light fills the room coming, from mushrooms of every size and shape.  Gelatinous green cave slugs, thick as a brawny man's arm, crawl along the mounds and hummocks of fungus, grazing endlessly on this underworld orchard.  A thick column of polished stone is set before you and the remains of brickwork here and there show this is more than an accident of nature."
