    "Pale blue walls surround this semi-circular room that appears to take up considerably less than half of this floor of the lighthouse.  Leaning up against the straight wall, a small table stands beside a curved pale blue doorway that leads out of the room.  Nearby, a young attendant stands ready to serve.  The focal point of the room is a swirling sunny yellow portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  River reeds and water lilies have been etched into the metal, their shapes intertwined to form a complex pattern."
