    "The rustic furnishings occupying the generous room could easily adapt to use in the wilds.  A gentle breeze from an open, crystal skylight above rustles papers piled on a travel-scarred campaign desk which commands an expansive view of the starry night sky.  Nearby, an assortment of campstools circle a low table, while across the room, a simple wooden platform covered with thick furs offers a comfortable place to sleep.",
