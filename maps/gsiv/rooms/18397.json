    "Panels of transparent glass comprise the ceiling and adjoining walls of the flourishing greenhouse.  A natural cedar jewelry case resides over a slew of vividly flowering terra cotta planters.  Some stone pottery vases and delicate glass-capped floral arrangements are strewn across an aged wooden island at the room's center."
