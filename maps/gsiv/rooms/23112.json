  "description": [
    "Cramped in size, the cavern niche is entirely walled with limestone rubble, clearly the result of a massive cave-in.  Bits of mining tools poke out of the limestone, as if they were held by hands caught under the path of the earth when it fell.  A wooden bowl with several tarnished silver tools, several of them rusted through, resides on the ground."
