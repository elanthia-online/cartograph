    "The galley is well-lit by a large brass oil lantern hanging from the center beam.  In one corner is a rather messy table that should be able to flip down if it was in working order.  The table is currently covered in scraps from some unidentifiable meal as well as part of a map with a knife cleaving it to the table.  In another corner is a cook stove covered in grime."
