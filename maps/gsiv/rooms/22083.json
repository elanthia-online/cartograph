    "This small, quiet courtyard is bordered on the north by the main structure of House Paupers.  To the east are the ornate arches leading to the Hall of Lore.  To the south and west are tall, impenetrable hedges up which a flowering vine has grown.  A riverstone fountain chuckling pleasantly in one corner of the courtyard is shaded by a flourishing apple tree."
