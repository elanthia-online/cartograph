    "Graceful oak columns rise and bend inward to a central boss, transforming this half-hexagonal room into a perfect amphitheatre, illuminated by pairs of tall, thin windows in each of the three outer walls.  Long pennons flutter down from the uppermost beams, their silken lengths woven in subtly shaded crimson and vermillion hues and bordered in gold.  The floor at the south end is raised slightly, creating a stage for a soloist or chamber ensemble."
