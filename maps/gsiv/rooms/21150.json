    "Dust and cobwebs, their fibrous skeins swaying each time someone passes by, decorate the cobblestones of the alcove's domed ceiling.  Flicker candlelight reaches outward from a small, dirty glass lantern that rests upon the scarred oak table, which is surrounded by stubby chairs.  The scent of fresh rushes mingles with the dust making the air heavy and thick."
