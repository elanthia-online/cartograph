  "description": [
    "From this vantage point, the massive dome to the west takes on greater definition, its resemblance to a huge spider now obvious.  The sinuous outlines of the temple walls capture the essence of a predator, tensed and ready to pounce on the quarry trapped within the gossamer web.  A small thatched hut stands near you, small and helpless, like a victim cowering in the shadow of the temple."
