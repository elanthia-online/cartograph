    "Bright oil lamps overhead provide light for a tailor and seamstress busy at work.  Bolts of fine cloth, sequins, bone and ivory buttons, thread and needles fill several open cupboards around the workroom.  On a sewing table, a piece of soft rolton wool is marked with the chalk outline of a fashionable woman's cloak."
