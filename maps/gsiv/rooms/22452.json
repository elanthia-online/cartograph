    "Thick poles of ebonwood hold up the walls and roof of this spacious pavilion.  A rich carpet of wool covers the ground, its surface woven into a detailed pattern of crimson and gold.  A few large racks stand to one side of some opened boxes and crates.  Several crystal globes hang from the ceiling, brightening the dark space."
