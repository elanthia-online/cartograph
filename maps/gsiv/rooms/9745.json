    "A large hole gapes in the trunk of the tree, allowing small creatures access to the open air high in the canopy of the blighted forest.  The edges of the hole are splintered and new growth is covering the raw areas over with bark.  Large amounts of bat droppings cover the floor, while small fungus-like growths and ferns sprout from the guano-covered bark.  Protruding from the growth and droppings are the remains of a decomposing corpse."
