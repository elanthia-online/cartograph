    "The den is inhabited by a wealth of polished armor, weapons, and shields.  Against the wall is an opened steel cage with a slab of raw meat inside.  Lit torches protruding from the walls flicker from time to time, shedding a deep tone of light across the walls that is as vivid scarlet as fresh blood.  Against one of the dark stone walls stands a rolaren weapon rack and an iron shelf.  Opposite hangs a large painting, its colors jewel-like in the low light."
