    "Massive logs of gnarled cedar perfume the air from the perimeter of the hall.  Living evergreen boughs contrast vividly against the geode-like, expansive, indigo-hued crystal ceiling as hundreds of tiny glowing spheres peek out from between the facets, their light refracted onto a few dozen rows of comfortably padded seats and rugs covering parts of the polished floor.  A central aisle delineated by two rows of braziers leads from some large grainy cedar double doors to a carefully constructed heap of jagged grey boulders cradling an expansive cedar and pine stage with a tall thick velvet curtain at its rear."
