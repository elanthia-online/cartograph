  "description": [
    "The natural beauty of the multi-level waterfall is striking from the vantage point of this topmost plateau.  Winding in from the northwest, the crystalline water of the river cascades down over the ledge to pool up and overflow from the next level, then empties into the mist-shrouded lagoon at the bottom.  Travel is only possible on the western side of the water, as the terrain thins considerably on the eastern side where it surrenders to the coastal cliffs that plunge sharply to the beach."
