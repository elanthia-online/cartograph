    "The ledge is wet and hot to the touch.  Just holding on is a chore, and blasts of steam slap against the rock as if hoping to tear all life away and hurl it into the vengeful maelstrom.  Down below a dark opening seems to lead to a tunnel from the crashing surf, for every now and then a great wave crashes in, only to be vaporized almost instantly as it meets the lava flow."
