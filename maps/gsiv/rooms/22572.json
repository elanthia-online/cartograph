    "Assembled with obvious haste and lack of skill, the shack's walls barely keep any light and sound from filtering in, much less provide secure shelter from the elements.  A rotting oak table tilts to one side but still is somehow able to hold the wares displayed on it without falling over.  Beside it, a lidless and splintered haon chest holds more items for sale.  Almost as an afterthought, a sign has been tacked to one wall."
