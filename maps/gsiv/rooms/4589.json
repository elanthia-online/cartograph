    "The breeze coming from the open window does little to alleviate the heat in this room.  Hanging on the walls by the hearth is an assortment of copper pots and stoneware.  Spread out over a wooden cutting table are various spoons, knives, and forks with long wooden handles used in the daily preparation of the meals.  A trail of spilled flour leads toward the partially opened door of the pantry.  At the far end of the kitchen, a darkened doorway leading down to the wine cellar stands wide open."
