    "As the deep ravine edging the path turns in toward it, the trail dwindles into nothing.  A pile of boulders edges its demise, throwing irregular shadows across the trail's remnants.  Wasps buzz idly in clouds over the stones, darting in and out of crevices and soaring out over the ravine on drafts of wind."
