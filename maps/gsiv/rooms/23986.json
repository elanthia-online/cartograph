    "Smooth oak planks, swept free of all debris, line the floor of the sparse little wagon.  A row of brass hooks lines the polished oak wall near the egress.  A fresh flower bouquet in a crystal vase sits atop a brass-reinforced glass showcase that is centered along the back wall, while a small display stand occupies the opposite wall."
