    "The sweet, dry fragrance of freshly sanded wood permeates the air in this spacious shop, combining comfortably with the smell of deep orange polishing oil.  Spread across the floor and proudly propped on sample racks around the walls, Flaygeyl's diverse selection of wooden floorboards await the purchaser's home decorating whimsy."
