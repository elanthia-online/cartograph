  "description": [
    "A smooth-edged monolith is carved out of the raw stone of the cave's northern wall, geodic veins lending the pale rock bands of color: a sharp sky blue here; dusky gold there.  All around, the walls are pocked with niches, each one containing a tallow candle.  Their concerted light plays over a stylized sunburst etched into the forward face of the carving, its sole visible adornment."
