    "Smooth black stone walls with circular windows and low ceilings create a chamber of comfortable proportions.  Ample enough to carry out one's work, yet small enough to keep focused on the tasks at hand.  A sturdy workbench sits at the very center of the room, fully equipped with the necessary apparatus to pursue alchemical transmutations.  Low, black-painted wrought iron lamps cast enough illumination to glint off the translucent still on the workbench."
