    "White-washed walls wrap the room from the orange and blue terracotta ceiling to the cobalt blue and white tile floor.  Wash basins are arranged on low tables on one side of the room, clothes-lines strung above them, while the other side of the room houses painted privacy screens around copper and steel bathtubs.  A series of wrought iron hooks rest near the open door, which are directly opposite an oak and iron water pump."
