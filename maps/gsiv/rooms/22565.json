    "The small, cramped room reeks of death and decay.  The skeletal remains of someone or something lie in a heap on the floor -- the right hand of the deceased is missing.  A number of iron shelves line the northern wall underneath a hole in the ceiling.  Leading to the storefront is a door, the frame of which is deeply scratched."
