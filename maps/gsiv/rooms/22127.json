  "description": [
    "Sketches of herbs and plants decorate the cream walls, and a tan fringed rug tops the gleaming linden floors.  Swathes of beige gauze enclose an alcove, in which is tucked a quilt-covered bed.  Across from the sleeping alcove is a wall filled with bookshelves.  A book and paper-strewn desk rests to the one side of the door, and a dresser topped with a vase of lilacs graces the other side.  A multi-paned window overlooks the manor grounds."
