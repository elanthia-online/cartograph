    "The bright white silk canopy of the open-air pavilion shields the area from the sunlight.  A series of terracotta pots fill the area, creating a makeshift garden.  In each of the terracotta pots grows a different flower, the varied blooms surrounding a semicircular bench with a rainbow-colored backdrop."
