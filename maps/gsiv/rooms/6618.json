    "As you move around the pentagram, the lines seem to waver.  Parts of the lines that seemed golden a moment before shift to bronze, then fade to the verdigris of old copper.  The walls are very rough, and here at close range, one can see a pattern of scratches etched across their surface -- almost as if something had marked the rock walls with claws."
