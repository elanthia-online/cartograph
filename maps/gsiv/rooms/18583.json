  "description": [
    "A large stump sits in the corner of field, its roots still embedded in the earth, while its flat top is smooth and faded.  Still, though the sun has paled the wood, ring upon ring can be seen in the woodgrain, marking the stump as all that is left of a once large and aged tree."
