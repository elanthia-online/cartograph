    "Staking out their territory with sound, bullfrogs send the deep bass of their croaking throughout the environs.  Soft breezes sweep through the trees, creating a rhythmic squeaking sound as branches rub together, the cadence underscored by the soft hooting of an unseen owl.  Adding a soft hum, hundreds of mosquitos buzz around searching for unwary victims.  Drifting in from the southwest, the distant sound of crashing waves compliments and completes the natural symphony filling the night air."
