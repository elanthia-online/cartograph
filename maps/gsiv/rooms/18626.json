    "A natural bubble of clear glaes formed long ago by an errant lava flow caps off a long underwater stone tunnel.  All around you is the majesty of the ocean, perhaps twenty feet from the surface.  Seaweed caresses the sphere of glaes from the sandy floor, giving many small crustaceans a place to hide and hunt.  Schools of brightly colored fish swim around just outside, darting curiously about the natural aquarium.  One slow, persistent snail oozes up the rock, keeping the surface clean."
