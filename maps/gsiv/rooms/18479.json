    "Some of the leaves of a nearby sheaf of corn have been peeled back and tiny yellow and white kernels peek through the obscuring strands of corn silk.  Someone has come through and helped themselves to a few of the cobs of corn as is evidenced by the discards lying on the ground along the path."
