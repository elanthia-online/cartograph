    "Bright green and blue will-o'-wisps dance about the muck-lined pathway leading toward the wooden cottage, appears quite weathered and its windows are boarded-up with mismatched wood.  Branches dangle from the thatched roof, most likely due to the grove of yews surrounding the cottage.  The signs of an old fire mar the ground on the western side of the cottage."
