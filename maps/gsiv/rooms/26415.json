    "A bank of large, grate-hatched windows provide invited guests a vantage point to gaze down and out upon the incoming swells surrounding the aftcastle deck.  A polished oak desk spread with quills, an inkwell, and logbooks sits to one side, and a high-backed, red leather chair is tucked neatly beneath it.  Tapestry-covered sofas provide additional seating and a pale woolen carpet cushions the teak planked flooring."
