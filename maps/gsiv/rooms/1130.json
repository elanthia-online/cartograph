    "A brisk wind stirs the leaves in the treetops, but at ground level it is filtered into a pleasant warm breeze.  Night birds call to each other from the surrounding trees while small mammals dart through the thick leaf cover in search of food.  The trail is dry and level, providing good footing.  The occasional mosquito might cause an annoyance, but for the most part the forest is a tranquil, pleasant place to be this night.",
