    "Rounded light grey shrubs randomly placed provide a counterpoint to the dark grey hedges that surround this peaceful enclosure.  Metal rocking chairs lounge at various points across the area, with one blazing torch accompanying each chair.  Crickets and frogs call happily from underneath the protective foliage.  Openings carved through the dense towering shrubs lead north, northwest, and west."
