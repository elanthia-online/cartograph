    "The distant sound of crashing waves filters in on the cooler breeze present near the lagoon edge.  Several tall trees provide a backdrop to the foliage that spreads out from the shore, creating a thick canopy of leaves that sway with the breeze and help to break the sunlight into less intense, variegated shafts of heat."
