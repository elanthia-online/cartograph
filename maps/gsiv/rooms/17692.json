    "Two rectangular windows offer light to the small, dust-laden study.  A desk is placed against one wall, atop of which rests a tattered journal, and bookshelves line the wall opposite.  A small, jeweled chest sits beneath the window, a lock lying shattered on the ground beside it.  In addition to the broken lock, several glass jars lie smashed across the faded carpeted floor."
