    "A one-armed dwarf sits on an old stool in the back of the wagon, smoke rings trailing up from the bone pipe clenched between his teeth.  He puffs lazily on his pipe as he watches the customers, rudely snorting at the sight of some of them.  The wagon is rather plain, except for a series of stained wooden shelves and the strong scent of tobacco and dirt."
