  "description": [
    "The spacious interior of this renovated barn bears a bustling tavern and kitchen.  A tanik plank ladder climbs up the back wall of the barn, leading upwards to the loft.  Mounted on the wall above the battered haon bar is a three-pronged matte steel pitchfork.  The hard-packed earthen floor is covered with a thin layer of straw.  A rectangular haon notice hangs from one of the posts of the building."
