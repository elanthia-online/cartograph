    "Beige silk wallpaper, handpainted with butterflies fluttering among a wide variety of flowers, lines the walls of the small area.  Soft, deep blue carpet stretches across the floor, and a crimson velvet divan is nestled in one corner.  A row of small silver hooks line one wall next to a floor-length mirror."
