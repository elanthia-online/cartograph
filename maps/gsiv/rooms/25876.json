    "Soft cream colored walls complement the chocolate toned crown molding, while tall segmented windows create a solarium like area in the northwest corner.  A pair of ivory couches are separated by a low-set rectangular lor table, set perfectly into the nook.  Tucked against the expansive southern wall is a four-poster mahogany bed with a cream and grey marble fireplace set into the western wall adjacent to it and opposite a vaalin inlaid wardrobe.  Recessed into the corner and facing out into the back gardens is a carved lor writing desk, its location providing a peaceful private getaway."
