    "The chamber narrows artistically along a gold-covered lattice rug.  A row of narrow skylights shine light upon support beams below, casting shadows in a matching latticework pattern to the rug.  Draped with curtains, a carved gold arch leads deeper into the visitor's wing.  A servants bell hangs from a simple hook on the inside of the arch."
