    "Strands of white, black, and grey chiffon have been draped across decorative silver hooks placed along the upper edges of the structure.  Rectanglar slats of polished oak are set into the floor in an exquisite chevron pattern, and pale ash shelves line the interior walls.  A dark mahogany armoire with elaborate carvings is filled with pale-colored ensembles, and a faint scent of lavender and coconut drifts through the room."
