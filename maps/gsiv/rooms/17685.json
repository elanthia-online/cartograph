    "A cool breeze, laden with the scent of river reeds and mud, flows into the tunnel from the east.  In addition to the gentle wind, the tunnel eastwards appears to have a source of light other than torchlight.  Meanwhile, to the southeast is a dark sloping tunnel entrance absent of light and the source of a slow, steady roar."
