    "Beneath a domed ceiling of mosaic glaes tiles, the upper floor of the shop is given way to a ring-shaped reading room of blue velvet settees and overstuffed ivory leather chairs.  In the middle of the room, a mistwood staircase spirals downwards to the ground level, with matching carved mistwood railings blocking any inadvertent drop-offs."
