    "To the south some crude bone steps lead down into a small pond, ominously dark in the night.  A pair of short stakes flank the steps, each capped with a humanoid skull.  The skulls rock on the posts as the wind blows, like heads nodding.  A nearby tree spreads its bare limbs partially over the lake.",
