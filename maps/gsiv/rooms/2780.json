    "The rustic realty outlet has little more in it other than a counter, a board with some notices pasted up and a statue of a bear like the ones the dwarves carve with nothing more than an axe and then barter to unsuspecting Wehnimer's tourists.  A few colorful braided rugs are scattered about the pine plank floor, as well.  Against the back wall, a black wood-stove puts out heat, keeping the little office welcoming and warm."
