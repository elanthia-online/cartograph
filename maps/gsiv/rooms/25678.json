  "description": [
    "The walls of the green room are covered with likenesses of famous and not-so-famous performers, past and present, painted by a number of different artists.  Someone has constructed a makeshift makeup table against the back wall -- two crates and a plank are topped with little colored pots and a scattering of sequins, buttons, feathers, and other paraphernalia.  A long table sits in the center, surrounded by mismatched chairs."
