    "The light is low and intimate in the chamber, intruding through a window shadowed by pine branches outside and a linen drape within.  Across the walls, a fine pattern of feathers is painted with delicate color and a light touch.  A heavy, modwir bed sits in the corner, fitted with fawn-colored linens and a bright-hued quilt that offers most of the color in the room."
