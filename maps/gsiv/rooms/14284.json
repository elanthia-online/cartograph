  "description": [
    "Fragmented bones and other talismans of warding hang in the clouded, gritty windows above, bearing testament to the superstitions a place such as this might breed.  Rivulets of water trickle steadily between the cobblestones and rank odors waft through the air, their sources shrouded in patches of hazy shadow."
