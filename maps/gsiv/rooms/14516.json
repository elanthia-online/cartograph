    "Dappled moonlight falls on slate pavers underfoot.  Iris beds, their normal colors turned to various shades of grey under the moon's illumination, edge a shallow pool in the center of the garden.  An ancient willow overhangs a limestone wall to the south, its branches rustling in the warm breeze.  Benches nestle in the graceful curves of the wall.  Climbing roses frame the windows and doors of the western manor wall, their sweet scent drifting on the breeze.",
    "Dappled sunlight falls on slate pavers underfoot and the soft humming of bees at work fills the air.  Iris beds, in shades of white to the deepest purple, edge a shallow pool in the center of the garden.  An ancient willow overhangs a limestone wall to the south, its branches rustling in the warm breeze.  Benches nestle in the graceful curves of the wall.  Climbing roses frame the windows and doors of the western manor wall, their sweet scent drifting on the breeze."
