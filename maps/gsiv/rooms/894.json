  "description": [
    "A set of precisely-cut, squared steps has been crafted into the tunnel here, perhaps to allow for an easier ascension as the tunnel continues its incline to the north.  Half a dozen in number, the steps have been carved out of the rocky floor itself, their straight edges and well-defined lines the marks of true stonesmiths."
