    "High ceilings and smooth, plaster-coated stone walls give this large room a surprisingly airy feel.  A smaller version of the fieldstone fireplace in the hall below keeps the bedchamber comfortable, as a north-facing window is shuttered tightly against the evening's chill.  Although a rough-hewn oak bed lavishly draped with furs dominates the room, a free-standing grindstone and a well-stocked weapons rack draw attention near the window.  Two small tables guard the bed, while an enormous mithril vault is built into the opposing wall."
