    "Two tall black bookcases are filled to capacity with tomes.  Between them stands an intricate glass cabinet, its transparent doors closed and locked.  Four triangular tables have been arranged in the center of the room, their points facing outward in the cardinal directions.  A detailed chart hangs on the wall."
