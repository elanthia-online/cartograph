  "description": [
    "The overhanging moss and drooping tree branches of the massive oak tree thin out a bit, allowing one to gaze down over the surroundings from atop the large hill.  Forests spread for miles beyond a small meadow at the base of the hill, and the landscape is dotted with clusters of wildflowers of every hue imaginable.  A few weathered grey stones peek out from the earth, offering up a pleasant place to sit and admire the view."
