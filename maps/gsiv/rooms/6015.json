    "A large selection of implements hangs from the walls and beams in this section of the barn.  Scythes and sickles, their long, curved blades honed to a gleaming sharpness, adorn one area of the walls, while picks and shovels in nearly new condition are affixed in another area.  A heavy spool of thick rope nestles into the southeast corner.  The chaff is heavily scuffed and disturbed as if something or someone has been traveling between the tools and the barn door with great regularity."
