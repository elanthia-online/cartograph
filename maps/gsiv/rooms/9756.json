  "description": [
    "The incline begins a steep rise to the north, snaking around the mammoth bole in a daunting spiral.  Fine growths of some type of moss cling to the edge of the walkway, sending spidery, silver-grey tendrils down into the chasm to a depth of six feet in some places.  From this vantage point, the floor of the tower is so far below, it is almost hidden in the gloom."
