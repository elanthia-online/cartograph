    "In this comparatively smaller room of the tent, several large containers with neatly printed labels line one tent wall.  A modwir bin labeled \"Warm Stuffses\" with partitions for numerous articles of clothing sits beside a scuffed balenite footlocker labeled \"Fighting Stuffses\" large enough to hold several weapons and pieces of armor.  Winterberry-stained handprints cover the outside of an off-white wicker basket labeled \"Belly Stuffses,\" likely a space reserved for tarts and other snacks."
