    "Several steel ribs span the width of the wagon, a beige canvas stretched between them to protect the interior from the elements.  Broken cogs and sprockets litter the gouged wooden floor, and a short wooden stand sits just inside the triangular flap.  A low bench juts out from the front wall and is strewn with patched cushions.  In the rear of the wagon, a cog-covered metal rack stands next to a squat steel door."
