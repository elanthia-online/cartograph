  "description": [
    "Falling from the peaked ceiling in tailored pleats, the dusky blue marbrinus silk forms smooth, silver-veined walls and pools elegantly on blue-green rugs patterned with peacock feathers.  Frosted glass lanterns dangle from the ceiling on silver chains over a glass counter, providing excellent illumination by which to view the wares, while a pendant lantern hangs over a dusky blue painted thanot table."
