    "Fresh azure paint covers the wood-paneled walls, and wispy white clouds are brushed onto the ceiling of this sun-lit room.  Metal windchimes hanging near an open window clink together in a song of the breeze.  The shop's wares are neatly showcased on some villswood shelving against the walls and a silver display case in the center of the room."
