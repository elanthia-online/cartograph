    "A constant roar originating from the ceiling on the northwestward end of the tunnel renders all other sounds mute.  The tunnel floor, a mixture of stone, mud, and pools of water, offers a slippery purchase for those wishing to proceed eastward.  On one wall hangs a rusted iron lamp with a single thick candle dutifully burning away at the surrounding darkness, reflected in the still pools of water."
