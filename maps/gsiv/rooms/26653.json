  "description": [
    "From beneath, the surface of the water is a window of wrinkled, moving glass interspersed with foamy caps.  The ebb and flow of the churning current kicks up black sand that whirls about an eroded iron plaque half-buried in the sandbar.  In the refracted moonlight, a large pale red crab, its claws held wide open, scoots quickly along the sandbar, unaffected by the tide."
