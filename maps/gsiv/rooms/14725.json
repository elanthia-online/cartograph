    "Several cracks in the rock outcrop intersect here forming a star shaped cavern.  Grooves from some sort of animal claws mark the well-worn floor and an unpleasant odor hangs in the air.  Lack of light limits visibility but sounds echo in from every direction.  Loud chattering can be heard from nearby though there is not any visible movement.",
