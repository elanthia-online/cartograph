  "description": [
    "A magnificent fountain stands nobly in the center of this clearing.  The ring of yew trees provide certain shelter to anyone caring to spend some time listening to its flows.  Glancing around you can spy the occasional devotee sliding past on the exterior circle, while a monk or two sit in careful meditation at the fountain edge."
