  "description": [
    "Smooth slate flagstones of rose and copper stretch outward to form a patio within the curve of the pathway's hairpin turn.  Shadows stretch upon the descending southeastern track, while sunlight illuminates patches of snow along the ascending eastern steps.  A low stone bench flanked by dormant lanterns provides a comfortable space to view the scenery."
