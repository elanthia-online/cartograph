    "The room is unlit and filled primarily with an almost tangible darkness.  Thin shafts of light leak in through narrow gaps in the wooden bulkheads, coming to rest on metallic objects and reflecting faintly onto neighboring items.  Mixed piles of unrelated objects - coins, gems, weaponry and armor - fill the entire chamber."
