    "The path curves along the crest of the hill, amid scattered trees and boulders and a few small houses that enjoy a view of both the bay to the north and the woodlands to the south.  Berry bushes and wildflowers grow lushly in the grassy patches between the trees, and the sound of a woodpecker tapping away at his business echoes from somewhere nearby."
