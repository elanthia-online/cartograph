    "Crystalline formations glitter and gleam across the inside of the cavern's dome, as if one were standing in the center of a giant geode. The crystals reflect and refract the light cast by the luminescent toadstools below.  The light plays off stone streets, shifting from color to color as one moves in relation to the facets of the crystals.  Large pots, each sporting one massive toadstool, line the thoroughfare in all directions."
