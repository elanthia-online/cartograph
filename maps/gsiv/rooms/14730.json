    "Dark modwir veneer walls enclose the spacious room, while sturdy wooden beams cross the ceiling, support against the island's volcanic protests.  A low wooden table sits between two plush leather couches resting in one corner.  Another corner hosts a copper-banded keg with a heavy slate blackboard hung on the wall above it.  Along one wall stands a tall mistwood bookcase and a wide modwir-framed window.  In the center of the room is a gold-threaded navy blue rug illuminated by a crystal chandelier."
