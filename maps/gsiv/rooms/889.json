    "Clusters of low-growing bushes and grasses cling to niches in the stone walls, their foliage ranging from shades of pale yellow to dark green.  Hearty and tenacious in this inhospitable environment, the rugged plant-life obstinately defies the harsh, mountain winds and chill temperatures of the canyon."
