  "description": [
    "Most of the shelves within this modest library stand empty.  Whatever books may have held a place here are either lost, or may have long since decayed to dust since unlike the other rooms within the observatory, this place is in poor shape.  Torn and tattered pages lie scattered on the floor and worktables, and the books that do remain on the shelves appear cluttered and disorganized.  Someone, or something, appears to have been searching here, but it is unclear as to what they were looking for."
