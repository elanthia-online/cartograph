    "An exhibit table is flanked by a pair of very tall ceramic vases.  Hanging from the ceiling is a giant stuffed lizard.  A shelf along the wall contains a number of smaller items.  A large pick-axe with a silver head leans in the corner.  The pleasant scent of beeswax and incense suffuses the room."
