  "description": [
    "Rows of white granite columns echo the outside stylings, ringing the room and bracing the corridor leading off to the east.  At the center and beneath an open ceiling is a step-down area filled with comfortable settees.  To ward off the damp chill that comes with rain and cooler seasons is a free-standing white marble fireplace.  Blue star mosaic insets scatter across the pale travertine floor, and sky-hued gossamer curtains dance with the breeze.  A garden lush with native plants opens out to the north."
