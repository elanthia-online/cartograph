    "The southeast end of the corn field meets the northwest corner of the slough.",
    "The southeast end of the corn field meets the northwest corner of the slough.  The result is a messy conglomeration of mud, cattails, and corn stalks.  The mud and cattails intrude upon the neatly arranged corn area, causing the corn stalks to only grow to half their normal size in the soggy ground.  If less rain occurs, though, the mud will dry out, leaving the cattails to wither and the corn stalks to grow healthier and taller.  One never knows about the weather."
