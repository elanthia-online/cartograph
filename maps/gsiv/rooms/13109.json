    "Iron lanterns illuminate the dim corridor from their positions between several windows with tightly closed shutters along the western wall.  Trickling in from the open door is the cinnamon-laced aroma of morning porridge left to simmer on the hearth and the bouquet of coffee left to boil for too long.",
    "Sunlight streams through open windows, their shutters folded back to take full advantage of the daytime illumination, along the western wall of the corridor and they offer a perfect vantage point of the practice courtyard beyond.  Trickling in from the open door is the gamey aroma of meats slow roasting on a spit and the loud sound of men and woman talking and joking."
