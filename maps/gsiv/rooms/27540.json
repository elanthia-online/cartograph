  "description": [
    "Wind rushes over cracks in the ceiling, stealing the air from the small cavern with a whooshing force that sets loose fabric fluttering and torches guttering as they struggle to stay lit.  Wrought iron railings encircle a conical crystalline structure that dominates the pitted shale floor, while worn depressions in the floor carry tiny rivulets of salt water towards the back walls.  An ornate rack fashioned of ebonwood and steel is lifted by oak planks off the moist ground to protect it from rotting, as is a decorative black lacquer wardrobe."
