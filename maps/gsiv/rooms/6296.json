    "A large clay pipe, some ten feet in diameter, runs across the tunnel.  Little hands have lovingly cleared away the dirt from floor to ceiling.  Unidentifiable chalk pictures sprawl across the sides, and scraps of fly-ridden meat are gathered in small piles at the base.  Dark water drips from a large vertical crack."
