    "An elaborate stained glass window has been set high into the ceiling here, depicting a large golden crown upon a field of white.  The daylight streaming in cloaks the chamber in a pleasantly bright amber glow, illuminating the small glaes-paneled case set below the masterful work of art and several chests lined up in a symmetrical pattern with the rest of the room.  A tattered robe hangs behind the wall nearest the case, its handsome design barely visible amid the rips and stains upon it.",
