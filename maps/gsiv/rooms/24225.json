    "Colorful ribbons stretch across the ceiling in woven patterns of blue, green, and pink, their ends bound to knots in the rosy-hued walls.  Long glass pendants encircle the room, their interiors producing a soft glow by which to see.  A long seat has been carved out of the surrounding wood, while a long table stands opposite."
