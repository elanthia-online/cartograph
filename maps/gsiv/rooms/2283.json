    "This is one of the few buildings in the area that remains relatively unscathed by fire.  The cold grey stone is accented in spots by scorch marks, where flames leapt through an open doorway but quickly extinguished themselves due to a lack of fuel.  Small cracks in the foundation, left unattended for so many years, have widened considerably, pushed apart by the dark green vines which invade even this dark stronghold.",
