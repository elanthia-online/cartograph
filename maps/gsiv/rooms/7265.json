    "The fetid odor of the mud that fills this furrow drives off even the gorcrows.  Gnarled tree roots reach through the low sloping sides of the trench and lie just beneath the surface of the muck, making every step a hazard for the unwary.  The few tombstones nearby are tilted at sharp angles and appear in some cases to have been pushed aslant from beneath.  To the west, tussocks of greying grass amidst the mud might provide more solid footing."
