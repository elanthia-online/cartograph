  "description": [
    "The steep rise brings with it brisk winds, drowning out the sounds of shoppers and merchants from the town below.  Tenacious beach grasses cling to the rocky embankment rising steeply to the northeast, while a gentler slope trails through the pebbled sands due west.  A moisture-laden mist carried on the breeze is saturated with the scent of the sea."
