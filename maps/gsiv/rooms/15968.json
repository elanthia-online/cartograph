    "A triad of white birch trees graces a clearing ringed with log cottages.  A few leaves still cling to the elegant branches, pirouetting in the gusting wind.  The bark curls off the trunks like parchment, accented with darker rings and a faint dotted pattern.  Light from some of the cottages casts a glittering reflection on the snow within the muted light of the mountainside forest."
