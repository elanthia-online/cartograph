  "description": [
    "The lane named after El Mikimen is less than orderly and pristine.  Gutters are clogged with debris and the homes are so crowded, they seem to share overlapping foundations.  Stray curs dash in and around holes in walls and legs of pedestrians.  A permeating odor of strongly spiced food pours from open windows on every side."
