    "Narrow shelves adjacent to a pair of white ivory basins protrude from an austere, grey-papered wall, one holding a neatly folded stack of plush cotton cloths easily within arm's reach.  A large, silvered glass mirror hangs above a dark walnut vanity of polished lacquered wood, closely matching the color of a leather-topped bench sitting off to one side.  Thick carpets patterned with scalloped quatrefoils muffle the sounds beyond the flora-carved door."
