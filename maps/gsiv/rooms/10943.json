    "A wooden counter divides this small workshop.  The flickering flames of a brazier reflect off the two tall, glazed windows, bathing the room in yellowish light.  An impressive array of antique locks and keys can be seen in a display case.  Behind the counter, leaning against a tall oak filing cabinet, is the smiling but watchful owner, the widow Galena.  A sign hangs above the counter.",
