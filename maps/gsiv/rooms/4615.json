    "Here at the trailhead, just beneath the cresting at Whistler's Pass, the surrounding landscape of the ancient forest is like a dark blanket settled over a valley.  To the southeast, the keep of Ta'Vaalor barely rises above the treeline edging Fearling Pass, its tower torches casting a tiny fiery glow in the otherwise blackened night.",
    "Here at the trailhead, just beneath the cresting at Whistler's Pass, the surrounding landscape of the ancient forest is breathtaking.  Jutting out and away from the mountainside, the view captures a glimpse of Mreanith Lake to the south and the rolling hills of Khalerineth Valley to the east.  Just beyond, the keep of Ta'Vaalor barely rises above the treeline edging Fearling Pass."
