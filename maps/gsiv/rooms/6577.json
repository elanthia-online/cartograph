    "The second level of the ancient keep is starkly bare.  The floor is uneven, its stone flagging broken and cracked.  At intervals along the curved walls, arrow slits are placed, granting defense of the tiered wall-walk below.  Circular windows are located high on the walls, shedding a diffused light that leaves this chamber in gloom.  The staircase leading to upper stories is completely demolished, prohibiting further ascent."
