    "Here, the garden is more like an arena, with several statues of Kai engaged in a variety of athletic activities upon a garden of multicolored sands.  All carved in pure white marble, they each suggest a promise of eternal youth.  In all cases, Kai is bare handed and often he is shown locked in combat with fearsome beasts the likes of which you have never seen.",
