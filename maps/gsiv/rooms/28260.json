  "description": [
    "A rectangular table stands in the center of this utilitarian room, with a number of wooden chairs along each of its longer sides.  Around the perimeter of the room are a series of padded benches, clearly meant for observers who are not participating directly.  Torches interspersed along the walls keep the space well lit, and also contribute a slightly smoky scent to the air due to the lack of ventilation."
