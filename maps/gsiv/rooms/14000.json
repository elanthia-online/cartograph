  "description": [
    "Tall mahogany bookcases frame this room, lending their warmth to the elegantly simple space.  Deep leather-upholstered couches and chairs have been gathered around a massive granite fireplace in which cherrywood logs are laid.  A silver looking-glass hangs above a mahogany bar along one wall, flanked by twin blue banners set with three orange chalices.  At the apex of the limestone arch leading into this room, a blue-edged topaz medallion glitters in the warm firelight."
