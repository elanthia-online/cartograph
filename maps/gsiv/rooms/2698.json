  "description": [
    "Loud cracking and groaning knifes through the arctic air, spilling out of the dangerous crevasse with alarming regularity.  The canyon makes a sharp turn as it skirts the edges of Aenatumgana intent at finding a way to split the mighty peak in two.  Black rock spears up out of the solid ice in a failing attempt at creating a windbreak against the fury of the shrieking winds."
