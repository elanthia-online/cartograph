    "Dried seaweed in every shade of green has been braided into thick strands of rope and coiled from the center in a dizzying spiral design to create the top of the table.  Each of the six helix rope legs appear to be made solely of the braided sea plant, but most likely consist of a wooden leg core that has been wrapped with the carefully crafted rope of rainbow green."
