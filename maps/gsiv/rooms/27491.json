    "Tiny crystal globes hang from the domed ceiling by slender bronze chains.  Standing in the center of the tent is a small wooden counter, its surface etched with a series of undecipherable runes.  Lengths of scarlet and ebon silk wrap about silvery mistwood poles that hold up the thick dark velvet creating the roof above.  A thick velvet flap partially hidden in the drape of the walls leads to another area."
