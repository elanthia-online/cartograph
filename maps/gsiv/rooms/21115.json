    "Long reed poles hold the encroaching jungle at bay to allow for a small domestic vegetable garden to flourish in this clearing.  Carrots, beets, cucumbers, and potatoes are arranged in neat little rows in the center, while wire cages at the edge of the cultivated ground support beanstalks and tomato vines.  Four torches, crafted of split bamboo that nestle a miniature urn of oil, have been set at the cardinal points and lay dormant in the sunlight.  Set beside a thin grass-lined footpath is a rough wooden bench, inviting rest.",
