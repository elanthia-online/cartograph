    "Staggered rows of densely packed coniferous trees block out the howling wind and snow to form a welcoming encirclement.  Twin guard towers stand to protect the entrance to this naturally formed palisade.  A few of the surrounding trees have been cut down to stumps which have been crudely carved into seating around a cozy, stone-lined fire pit.  Flanked by small patches of moonflowers, an ornate wooden bridge stretches across the half-frozen stream to a vast lodge."
