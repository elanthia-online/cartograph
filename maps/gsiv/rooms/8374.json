  "description": [
    "Deepening shadows in the rubbled entryway to this four-lobed structure fade into darkness at the far end of a southeast passage leading into the Stronghold bowels.  Glyphic markings repeat in a puzzling pattern along the crumbling walls, their ancient meaning lost.  Scraping noises from beyond a crude arched opening echo loudly in the emptiness of this underground labyrinth."
