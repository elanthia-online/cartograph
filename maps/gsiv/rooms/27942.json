    "A pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A woven Vornavian silk rug sits in one corner of a glossy black ebonwood floor.  There is an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on one side of the shop and a Vornavian silk-lined display case on the other."
