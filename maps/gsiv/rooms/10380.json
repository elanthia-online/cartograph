    "A polished brass chandelier brightens the room, the flame from its solid white candles reflecting off of several antique mirrors that hang on the walls.  Velvet draped tables display a wide variety of treasures, from arcane trinkets to fine quality armor and weapons.",
    "The formerly ornate room has been reduced to a burned-out husk of its former self.  The ceiling has partially collapsed, causing the scorched brass chandelier to list dangerously to one side.  Four scratched wooden tables have been set up for the shop's wares, displaying a wide variety of treasures, from arcane trinkets to fine quality armor and weapons.",
    "Four tables loaded with a variety of treasures, from arcane trinkets to fine quality armor and weapons, form the centerpiece of this room.  A large crimson and gold-threaded rug covers the wooden planks of the floor, and a sales clerk stands crisply at attention, a watchful eye on his merchandise."
