    "Red, white and black bricks alternate to form this portion of the Avenue.  Bordering the paving along the south is a white brick wall that would be waist height on most folk.  Fluted, white marble columns mark the garden's entrance, taking the place of gateposts -- both prominently hung with white shields bearing the image of a red heart transfixed by a vertical, black dagger.  On the north side of the Avenue, a small cul-de-sac reaches toward the canal, its paving bricks random in placement and color."
