  "description": [
    "The dusky-colored stone walls of the room are cloaked with tapestries, all depicting a sunset.  Hung side to side, they create a vivid panorama.  On the middle one, the sun falls into a crimson sea, its dying rays reaching into the twilight.  Jumbles of cushions have been piled near a fieldstone fireplace, their complex patterns a match to the scarlet velvet curtains at the windows.  Opposite the hearth is a four-poster bed hung with vermilion drapes, creating a private nook when they are drawn."
