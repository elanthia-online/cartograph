  "description": [
    "These spacious quarters are littered with arcane tomes, artifacts and implements of sorcery.  Centered against the far wall, an elegant round bed is draped by a lavish blanket of fire cat fur, with a dramatic painting hanging on the wall above it.  To the left is a modwir dressing table with an oval mirror mounted in its back and framed by two brass sconces.  A curtained window highlights the wall to the right and piles of books and scrolls are scattered below it."
