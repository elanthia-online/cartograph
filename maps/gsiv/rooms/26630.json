    "Simply decorated with recipes tacked to what remains of the cottage walls, the handwritten notes are accompanied by painted illustrations of various herbs, spices, flowers, and leaves.  Half the ceiling is still intact, while the rest has given way to wood rot, with only a canvas tarp stretched taut and coated stiff with wax to ward off wind and rain.  Several braziers set with small pots are either roasting coffee beans or making essences for flavoring."
