    "All around you, the pasture is in various states of decay, with a few spots where a thorny undergrowth has strangled out a life for itself.  Imbued with the stench of rotting earth, the air hangs like a noose about your neck.  Choking for air, you continue on your way, moving as far away from the smell as you can."
