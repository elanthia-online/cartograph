    "Candles cover every available space on the tiered walls, filling the room with golden light.  Tiny bits of silver hang from the high ceiling, glimmering like stars around a large golden ball.  Craters and seas have been beaten into the sphere, creating a replica of the moon Liabo.  Soft pillows made for kneeling sit in the center of the floor, making this a perfect place for reflection."
