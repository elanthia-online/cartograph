    "The benches are settled in the center of the room, and off to the side are racks of a variety of instruments.  A large bay window inset into the eastern wall is closed for the night.  Pale moonlight filters through the thin glass into the classroom, leaving only the shadows to play at night.",
    "Rows of benches fill the center portion of the classroom, some of them out of line as the children filling them move about restlessly.  A mature dark-haired man sits at the front of the room, attending to the parchment stacked on his desk.  In the back of the classroom, piles of satchels and bags are left strewn about the floor.",
    "The benches of the classroom have been pushed off to the side, and rows of chairs are left in the center.  The children sit neatly in the chairs, each holding a different instrument as they pay close attention to the woman standing behind a music stand.  A large bay window inset on the eastern wall is open to allow the sounds of nature and sunlight to enter the classroom."
