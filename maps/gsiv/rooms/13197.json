    "The stone walls of the shrine are bare and spartan, following the natural curve of the tower.  Banks and branches of candles cast their light upon an obsidian altar, which drinks the luminescence in and glistens darkly in response.  Above, the ceiling is painted with a simple but lifelike effigy in the shape of an armsman.  The candles, incense, and limited means of egress conspire to imbue the room with dry heat and the pungent aroma of morning glory."
