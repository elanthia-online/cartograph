    "A small penned-off section on this airy side porch is lined with paper flooring.  Tiny bowls contain water, and an overturned dish of meat scraps has been left unattended.  Bits of fur collect in the corners, and a large animal bone has been gnawed clean, dressed only in tiny scrapes and toothmarks.  An occasional giggle from across the side lawn draws attention to a small child running gleefully, chasing a mischievous puppy."
