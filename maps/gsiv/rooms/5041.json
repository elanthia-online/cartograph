    "The buildings rise precariously high along this section of the boardwalks that serve as the streets of this floating town.  The tall wooden buildings sway noticeably at the top, the barrels beneath creaking and groaning constantly.  The boardwalk is warped in places here, needing repair from constant exposure to the elements."
