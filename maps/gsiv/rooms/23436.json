  "description": [
    "The stale air carries a fetid odor of mildew through the small cabin.  A candle has been placed inside a pinpricked metal orb that hangs from the low ceiling, radiating minute flecks of light onto the map-covered walls.  Arranged near the back of the room, some uneven wooden shelves have been secured over a short wooden stool.  Soft plinking sounds can be heard as water drips from the ceiling into rusted pails that have been scattered across the warped plank floor."
