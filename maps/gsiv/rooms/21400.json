    "Empty liquor bottles have been strewn across the plank floor, a few of which have rolled underneath a sturdy oak wardrobe.  Along one wall sits a long oak bench that is cluttered with kohl sticks, powder vials, and a few pieces of clothing.  Heady perfumes have permeated the paneling of the room creating a flowery smell throughout the dressing room.  The sound of clinking glasses drifts up a flight of wooden stairs from the barroom below.",
