    "Rivulets of moisture run down the sheer face of the bluff and collect in a tranquil, shaded pool.  The sound of the streamlets hitting the water's surface is a gentle melody accompanied by frogs singing in the darkness.  Rising above, a flight of steps traverses the hillside in a dizzy ascent, marked by the rope and wood handrails on both its sides.  Ferns and the delicate blooms of wild orchids congregate around the sides of the clear pool in lush banks.",

The sound of the streamlets hitting the water's surface is a gentle melody accompanied by birds singing in surrounding trees.  Rising above, a flight of steps traverses the hillside in a dizzy ascent, marked by the rope and wood handrails on both its sides.  Ferns and the delicate blooms of wild orchids soften the harsh vista, and congregate around the sides of the clear pool in lush banks."
