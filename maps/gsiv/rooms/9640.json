    "So many of the statues along this hall have yielded to the depredations of vegetation and looters that it's impossible to tell what dubious pleasure they once represented.  A piece of the vaulted ceiling has collapsed, and the rubble has lain for so long that it too wears a verdant cloak of moss that thrives in the moist atmosphere."
