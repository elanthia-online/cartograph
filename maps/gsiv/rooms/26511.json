  "description": [
    "Painted boards are haphazardly thrown together with bits of twine and a smattering of nails to form the walls of this cramped hen house.  Tiers of screen-covered coups rise upon the left and right, each filled with dirty bits of straw, feathers, and discarded egg shells.  The low ceiling provides scant illumination for the tight quarters, which is probably why a small mud-smudged sign has been left near the entrance.",
