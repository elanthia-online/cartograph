    "Boats of various sizes...luggers, cutters, dories, square-bowed johnboats...lie scattered around the wide, grassy area beside the creek.  Some of the vessels are obviously under repair.  Others, irreparably damaged and set aside to rot, have become nearly lost in the tall grass.  A few of the smaller boats have been turned hull up, exposing their barnacle-covered bottoms."
