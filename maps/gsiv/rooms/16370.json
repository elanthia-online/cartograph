    "A variety of doors have been set into the thick whitewashed walls, each created from a different material.  Several of the doors stand open, customers examining their doorknobs and craftsmanship.  Along one of the walls stands an expansive saltwater lobster tank, the googly eyes of the creatures staring out into the room."
