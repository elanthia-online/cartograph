    "Tall mullioned windows offer the perfect view of the courtyard and well-tended lawns surrounding the west wing of the house.  Swathes of mulberry velvet frame each window, the drapes pulled back and held in place by ropes of pearls.  Neatly arranged rows of silk-cushioned chairs face an arboreal linden wood lectern, with a large blackboard on the wall behind and a pair of dress forms in the nearby corner."
