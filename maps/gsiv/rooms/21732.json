    "This room is oddly triangular, with the east wall running perpendicular to the hallway to the west.  A large round stained glass window, centered in the east wall, is remarkably fully intact.  Brilliant pastel shades bathe the room as the sunlight filters through the magnificent image of a noble elven warrior."
