    "Marked off by a triple-strung border with posts at each corner, the cleanly swept surface gives way slightly, lending each step a slight bounce.  Two stools face each other from opposite corners, the overpowering odor of acrid sweat hanging around them like a cloud.  A well-used bucket rests next to each stool, one unceremoniously knocked over and lying on top of what appears to a bloody pair of handwraps."
