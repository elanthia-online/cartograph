    "Though quite small, the tiny room is filled with light streaming in from the large glaes-paned windows that line the front of the shop.  The natural illumination adds a homey glow, and creates quite a comfortable setting for the customers.  A small doorway leading into the back, where all the crafting of the chairs takes place, affords a glimpse of the hustle and bustle of the workers.",
    "Moonlight streaming through large glaes-paned windows provides plenty of light to illuminate the insides of this small shop.  A semicircle of comfortable looking chairs provide customers an opportunity to try out the wares, or simply to sit and view the night sky.  A small doorway leading into the back, where all the crafting of the chairs takes place, affords a glimpse of the hustle and bustle of the workers."
