    "Dozens of life-like, stuffed animal heads have been carefully posed and mounted on the rustic timbered walls.  The work is so finely done, several of the trophy heads seem to be staring right at you, as if sizing you up for a snack.  A few specks of sawdust have managed to escape from their trophy prisons and reach freedom in the plush rugs covering the floors."
