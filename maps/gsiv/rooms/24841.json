  "description": [
    "The broad sweep of the black marble floor is interrupted by a sphere-topped black marble fountain.  Halfway to the golden oak ceiling, an ancient Tehiri ritual mask hangs on one of the smooth granite walls.  A beveled glass-covered case and a massive granite chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
