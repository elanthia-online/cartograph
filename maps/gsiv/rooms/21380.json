    "A wide, plaited blue wool rug sits at the entrance to this expansive wagon.  A boldly painted sign declares the merger of the two stores, detailed with gleaming gold wedding rings at the bottom.  To the east, a decidedly feminine room holds glass wares.  The faint scent of metal travels in from the west."
