  "description": [
    "The jumbled lane ends in a sorry excuse for a cul-de-sac.  Buildings stand haphazardly around a disjointed turn in the road.  The homes are built of stone, with roofs thatched in scanty shrub.  A lively group of small statues stands in one corner of the circle,  carved as a trio of prancing, bearded gnomes."
