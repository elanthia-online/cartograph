    "The small room is circular in shape with a series of beams rising upwards to create a vaulted ceiling.  Hanging from the apex of the beams overhead is a blackened metal chain suspending a large crescent-shaped chandelier.  A wooden trunk filled with blankets sits next to a large woven basket with a selection of pillows."
