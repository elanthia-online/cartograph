    "The nest of a marsh bird is nestled in the water plants, and several mottled eggs rest in the bowl of sticks and mud.  A thin track leads to the nest, and a slightly fatter track leads away from the nest, each long and squiggled.  Apparently, a snake found the bird's eggs to be a much-desired delicacy, as the creek is easily accessible from the bank."
