    "To the north, a large lake spans across the view, its dark expanse both eerie and still, while in the opposite direction, a treacherous path climbs up from meadow-like fields in the distance.  Directly below the ridge, a fetid bog sends her foggy tendrils slithering upward, where they wrap around the edges of a small shack."
