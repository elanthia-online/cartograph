    "Though tinted brown by decaying forest matter and sandy silt, the water retains some of its translucent qualities in the shallow areas of the lake.  Small snails crawl over the algae-coated rocks lining the bottom of the lake and fingerling fish dart amongst the thick stands of cattails growing along the bank.  The lakeshore rises gradually out of the water up to dry land."
