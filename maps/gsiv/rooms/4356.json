    "A variety of rich and hearty scents mingle in the air to create one flavorful aroma of roasted meats, vegetables, and nuts.  Flames crackle in the open-faced oven set into the back wall of the shop, the smoke and ash drawn up through the flue above, while a wood stove sits by topped with an iron pot of boiling soup.  Occupying the heart of the room, a long linen-covered table is arranged with a myriad of edibles for sale."
