  "description": [
    "Carved modwir paneling covers every wall of this luxurious chamber.  A thick white rug made from what must have been an enormous polar bear lies stretched between a small fireplace and an exquisite fruitwood sleigh bed.  One wall is dominated by a stunning tapestry stretched on an eonake frame.  In a quiet alcove sits a kneeler placed below a small relief of a thin blonde woman with an alabaster face.  From the side of her black and white robes hang a ring of keys."
