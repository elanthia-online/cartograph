    "Eldritch light from wall-mounted lanterns illuminates this cabin enclosed by thick dark blue velvet curtains that cover all possible sources of light from outside.  The walls are lined with bookcases filled with all manner of leather-bound volumes.  Covered with charts and maps, a large table surrounded by some cushioned chairs fills the center of the room.  Leading into the belly of the galleon is a darkened stairwell."
