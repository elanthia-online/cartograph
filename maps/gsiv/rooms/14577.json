  "description": [
    "The cool, muted hues of a mural frame the warped mass of a twisted veil iron altar perched at the sloping corridor's end.  Low-burning torches cast sullen light on the narrow carpeted path leading to the altar.  The walls to either side are formed of rugged, unfinished rock."
