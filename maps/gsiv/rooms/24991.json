    "A large pile of rubble intersects the area, splitting the dusty road into southern and western paths.  Scattered pieces of the blockade cover both paths, boulders and branches of wood mixed in with rusted weaponry and yellowed bones of various sizes, the pieces all covered in a dusting of clay and dirt."
