    "A handful of shelving units occupies this small room, stocked with the supplies needed for the daily activity of the guild.  Inventory lists penned in a meticulous hand have been tacked to the sides of each container.  Standing in the far corner is a sturdy invar cabinet, beside a few nondescript robes hanging on a rack."
