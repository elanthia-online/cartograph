    "Several linden trees line the path, the thick foliage overhead keeping the area cool and shaded.  The small stand of trees is deceptively tranquil.  A red squirrel sits perched in the tree, gnawing on a branch to sharpen its teeth.  The squirrel pauses, as though listening, then continues its gnawing.",
    "Several linden trees line the path, the thick foliage overhead keeping the area shaded from the moonlight.  The small stand of trees is deceptively tranquil.  A rustling sound comes from the branches of one linden tree and a pair of red eyes blink slowly in the darkness of the foliage."
