    "The path rises over a mound, providing a view of the surrounding desolation.  Crumbling and toppled tombstones mark the earth around plundered and violated graves.  To the northeast, the edge of a slime-covered pond encroaches on the graves, the inky water lapping at the edges of overturned tombstones.  The air is stagnant and foul."
