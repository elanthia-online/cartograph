    "Floor to ceiling bookcases line the eastern and western walls at this section of the library, each shelf packed tightly with volumes and tomes.  A tall window neatly bisects the eastern wall and is lined with a deep window seat.  Plump blue cushions adorned with white piping lay in neat piles to the right of the seat while a pair of three-tiered bookcases divide the room in half and are lined with past issues of the Elanthian Times.",
    "Floor to ceiling bookcases line the eastern and western walls at this section of the library, each shelf packed tightly with volumes and tomes.  A tall window neatly bisects the eastern wall and is lined with a deep window seat.  Plump blue cushions adorned with white piping are laid in a semi-circle around the seat where a young librarian reads stories to the group of toddlers sitting upon them.  Separating the group of toddlers from the library's other patrons is a pair of three-tiered bookcases covered with past issues of the Elanthian Times."
