    "Several wooden weapon racks have been attached to the stone floor of this small guardroom.  Rows of arrow slits have been expertly cut into the walls and offer a view of the northwest outer ward far below.  Above, a small wooden hatch probably leads to the tower's upper levels.  An old ladder leans against the east wall, many of its rungs broken or missing."
