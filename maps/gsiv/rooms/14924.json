    "At this point in the trail, halfway around the valley floor, the forested switchback wedge that leads into this remote cul-de-sac is barely visible, even with all three moons full and bright.  The sandstone cliffs enclose the wildflower-filled field like a coliseum.  Tree-sheltered trails lead off in two directions, leading back the way you came, or onward to complete the circle.",
