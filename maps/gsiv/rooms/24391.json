    "Small wooden shelves line the walls, and several rustic chairs are set around a small table.  Hooks accompany the shelves, holding a few collars and other adornments, and the single window in the small hut looks toward the distant forest line.  The faint scent of wildflowers trickles in from outside, and pleasant breezes wash in from the open doorway."
