    "The square marble table's top matches perfectly with the marble in the top tier of the huge fountain that looms to the northwest.  Thin, multicolored strands course through the golden marble, causing the surface to sparkle in the light.  The table's top has been buffed to a fine sheen, and the edges and supports are exactly chiseled.  An umbrella with a grey-and-gold awning spreads out over the table in an attempt to shade the occupants from the sun.  A freestanding torch occupies a place near the table."
