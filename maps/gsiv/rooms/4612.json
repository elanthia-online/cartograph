  "description": [
    "Overhanging branches and spreading underbrush nearly conceal the narrow trail, the strip of trampled leaves and packed earth barely obvious enough to hint at the passing of many woodland feet over the years.  The wooded hillside slopes slightly down to the east, but the dark woods obscure any sight of what may lie in that direction.",
