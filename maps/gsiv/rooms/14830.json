  "description": [
    "Heat rises from the floor and mixes with the stale air, creating a dense humidity that can nearly be swum through.  This room is virtually untouched and still possesses pickaxes and the like hanging from the hard surface of the cavern walls.  Several excavation holes filled haphazardly with dye-filled drinking vessels litter the ground and make it fairly difficult to navigate the area, yet not impossible."
