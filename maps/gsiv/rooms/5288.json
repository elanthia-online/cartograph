  "description": [
    "The ground flattens out to the east, but slopes up sharply to the northwest.  The ground is soft underfoot, as if kept constantly damp by the unrelenting fog that swirls ceaselessly on the path.  Leaves high above in the trees have a gray tint, almost as if covered by a thick layer of frost or spider webs."
