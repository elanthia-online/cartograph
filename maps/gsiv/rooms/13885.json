    "The tunnel opens to offer a view of River Ne'Halin.  Bordering the water is a small courtyard set with a group of low tables and chairs.  They offer a lovely spot to dine accompanied by the river's song.  To the north, the graceful silhouette of an arched bridge spans the current, its sides a filigree of stonework."
