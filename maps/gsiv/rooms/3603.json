  "description": [
    "Animated leaves skitter west on the wings of a light breeze, catching every so often on the small stones that protrude from the red clay surface of the path.  Imprints, marring a soft section of the clay, provide evidence of recent passage.  Traesharm bushes flourish along the fringe of the woods, though their bounty has already been harvested by the small woodland creatures that hastily scurry about."
