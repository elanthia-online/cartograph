  "description": [
    "Chilling you to the bone, a steady rush of icy water pierces your skin.  Endless blackness is broken only by tiny indigo twinkling in a short black sandbar nearby, the grains and oceanic debris upon it somehow glinting of their own accord in this pitch darkness of the deep.  A sudden rush of warmth from somewhere over your head is countered by a return to near-arctic temperatures as the water surrounding you shifts and resettles."
