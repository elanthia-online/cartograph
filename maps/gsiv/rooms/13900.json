    "The white marble forming the tub is veined with traces of green.  Silver spigots loose a steady stream of water into the tub at both ends.  Several silver towel racks line the wall, a series of trays with hot coals set into the wall behind them.  Small soap trays are attached to the tub at two of the corners.",
