  "description": [
    "Garnet sweetspire forms a decorative border to the lush lawn of cultivated and manicured grass, which spreads its luscious grass from the bright cobbled pathway to the low travertine wall at its far end.  Purplish-red fountain grass sprouts up in various locations, lanterns housed in their cascading depths.  Positioned beneath an umbrella of golden orbs, a small wooden lectern holds court over the lawn."
