    "A glaesine-topped ebonwood workbench dominates the cramped laboratory, one end pushed against the wall so it is beneath a pentagonal window.  Atop the window-side of the workbench rests a complicated, gold gem lens assembly.  A glass alembic and a pentacle-intaglioed, crimson marble crucible also congregate on the workbench.  Scorch marks mar the white marble floors, and a curtained arch leads southwest to the main hallway.  A rare flaming violet dimly lights one corner of the darkened room.",
