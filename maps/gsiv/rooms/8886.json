    "An enterprising young child set up a lemonade stand on the streetcorner, with business so brisk that he had to leave to make more.  An empty jar sits on the counter of the stand next to a box of glasses.  Some of the neighborhood animals mill about, waiting for the boy's return and perhaps a tasty handout."
