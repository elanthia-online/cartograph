    "Warm, humid air swirls about you.  Smooth obsidian benches have been carved from the walls, serving as shelves for a few neatly folded silken robes.  A large silver mirror hangs from the wall, coated with a light frosting of steam.  A smoked glaes door sits at the end of a short curving passageway, while a stairway leads downward, away from the portal."
