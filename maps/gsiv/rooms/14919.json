    "Black-striped silvery white bark from beech trees shimmers in the moonlight, with their leafy crowns interlacing above as they lean in towards each other from the opposing stream banks.  A solitary owl hoots from its nearby perch, breaking the hypnotic stillness created by the rushing water.",
    "Curls of black-striped silvery white bark from beech trees reveal the warm brown wood beneath, their leafy crowns interlacing above as they lean in towards each other from the opposing stream banks.  A pair of otters, their oily fur sleek from playing in the creek, romp from stone to stone."
