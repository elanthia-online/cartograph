    "The office is a flurry of activity, as several workers come and go with bills of laden requiring approval and signatures.  Occasionally one will pause to ask a question or two, receiving rapid instructions, then rush off to perform their duties.  A long counter separates the front of the room from a network of warehouse access passages in the rear."
