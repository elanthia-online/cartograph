  "description": [
    "Delicate clusters of low-lying ferns fill in the spaces between the beech trees here, then give way to rocks and dirt where the hill grows steeper.  A yellow-crowned parakeet sits quietly on a crooked bough, fanning out its painted tailfeathers.  To the northeast the trail vanishes into the undergrowth."
