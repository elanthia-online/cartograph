  "description": [
    "A large table set with mismatched chairs takes up most of the available floorspace, save for a small iron stove and oak supply bin crowded into one corner.  Lining the walls, shelves are stocked with labeled jars and a variety of cups, saucers, and spoons.  An elaborate chandelier dangles precariously above the table, a complicated arrangement of repurposed sugarbowls and teapots set with glowing candles."
