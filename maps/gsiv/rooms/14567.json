  "description": [
    "This side wing of the temple features a clear glaes and white iron structure that can serve as both conservatory and greenhouse.  A meandering path of slate surrounded by crushed riverstones wanders in and among towering tree-like ferns and raised beds of exotic flowers.  Benches placed here and there amid the lush flora create tiny nooks for private conversations and quiet meditation."
