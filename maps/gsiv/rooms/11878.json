    "The darkness closes in as the scum covering the water becomes heavier and heavier, compressed to the northwest by additions from the east.  On the north wall a skeleton hangs from a steel-like spike driven deep into the granite rock.  The force necessary to hammer a spike that deeply must have been tremendous, and the spike has not only been driven deeply into the rock but directly through one of the skeleton's vertebrae."
