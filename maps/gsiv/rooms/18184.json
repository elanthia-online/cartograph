  "description": [
    "You emerge onto a stone landing which looks like an island in a sea of cloud.  Somehow it is suddenly night, and the sky above is sparkling with thousands of tiny stars.  The Great Moon Liabo hangs silently in the sky, its surface shrouded by the clouds of its atmosphere.  A tiny black point against this backdrop, Tilaok, can be seen in its orbit around Liabo.  A large opening leads into the mountain at this height."
