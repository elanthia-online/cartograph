    "Refurbished driftwood walls rise from the driftwood floor.  Just above a stuffed feather and tar pelican hangs a iron-hooked split oak oar, and an exposed pine rafter ceiling completes the picture.  A flexible willow woven basket and a slender driftwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
