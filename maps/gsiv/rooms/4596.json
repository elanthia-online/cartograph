    "An oval-shaped table has been set in the center of a semi-circular row of waist-high filing cabinets.  Inlaid with crushed pieces of crown-of-Charl shells, a high-backed chair sits on the marble floor between the table and cabinets.  There is a neat stack of papers on one corner of the desk, which is held down by a fluted limpet shell.  On the northern wall, a raised mural depicts a scene of children running and laughing in a field of wild flowers."
