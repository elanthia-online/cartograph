    "The sides of the polished white marble floor are visible beneath the plush, powder blue runner that runs the length of the corridor.  The aromatic fragrances of tuberoses fill the air from where they overflow from within stamped brass flowerpots.  Several of the tall stalks are bent over the side of the pots, as if the clusters they bear are too heavy."
