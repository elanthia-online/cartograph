    "Knee-high hedges of heliotrope softly scent the air, as its profuse collection of purple flower spikes dip and sway atop silvery green foliage.  Ringed with a backdrop of glossy boxwood that stands several inches taller, the multi-layered barrier gives the garden a slight arena-like atmosphere."
