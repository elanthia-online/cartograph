    "The pale birch floorboards are covered by an almost wall-to-wall woven tapestry rug that depicts the terrain of the Elven Nations like an expansive cloth map.  Resting beneath a large birch-framed window is a spindly linden desk and its matching padded chair.  Flanked by potted ferns, a pale green birch door leads out of the room, while a gold-wrapped orb of glimaerstone hangs from the ceiling and further lights the room."
