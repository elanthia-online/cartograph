  "description": [
    "Beneath a low ceiling of mosaic jeweled tiles, the gangway is an expansive chamber with a wood-paneled floor adorned with flourishes of red brass and brighter scarlet lacquer.  A gold-threaded rug proceeds from a portal in the eastern hull of the ship, a wide arch framed in gilded fireleaf.  Glimaerstones set in heavy, spiraled sconces cast steady light upon the ostentatious chamber."
