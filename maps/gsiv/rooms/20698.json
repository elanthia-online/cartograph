    "Meandering through a rolling lawn of thick green grass, a decorative stone path leads from a white steel gate up to a large riverstone manor.  Tall modwir trees grow throughout the grounds, shading the building beyond.  Thick heliotrope bushes dotted with beautiful purple blossoms flank some steps leading up to the front porch, and add bright color to the verdant surroundings.  Hanging from carved wooden poles, colorful unlit lanterns line the walkway, the bases of which are surrounded by rings of bright lilies."
