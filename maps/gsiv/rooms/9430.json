  "description": [
    "A chainmail-clad dwarven guard lounges against the western wall, his posture indicating a lack of attention.  His eyes, however, dart to and fro, scanning each person as he or she wanders through the stone arch just to the south.  He seems to know them all by name, and they give him nods of recognition or brief smiles in a most respectful manner.  The young ones, in particular, seemed somewhat awed by this dwarf.  They deferentially intone, \"Hello, sir,\" as they pass."
