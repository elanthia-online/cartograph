    "[Red Bear Room]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Walls of dark granite paneled in polished redwood encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a charging red bear hangs along one wall, opposite a softly roaring hearth.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the sweet scent of rose petals rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its deep crimson linen snugly tucked."
