  "description": [
    "A burnished red maoral dragon head with flaring nostrils and gold-edged scales hangs on one of the gold-flecked alexandrite walls, and an ancient witchwood-beamed ceiling rises overhead.  A fierce-looking Ardenai tracker statue wielding a golvern-bound ruic longbow sits in one corner of a green marble-veined time ravaged brimstone floor.  There is a weather-worn modwir pirate's chest braced with gold filigreed bands on one side of the shop and a time-worn carved granite table with sturdy forged iron legs on the other."
