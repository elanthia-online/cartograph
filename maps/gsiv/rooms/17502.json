    "A smattering of mismatched stools are pulled up to a stained bar, which is, for all purposes, a slab of wood that looks to have taken multiple beatings.  Long scratches, deep nicks, and warped sections mar the bartop, and the display of drinks and food atop it does little to hide the destruction.  Behind the bar, there are more nicks in the wall, as if someone has shot several arrows or a handaxe or two in its direction.  Several torches send flickering light and moving shadows scattering through the area."
