    "The broad sweep of the limestone floor is interrupted by a miniature Solhaven Bay model.  Halfway to the white stucco ceiling, a sphere-hilted mounted sword plaque hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls.  A spiked iron maiden and a heavy lead glass display case are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
