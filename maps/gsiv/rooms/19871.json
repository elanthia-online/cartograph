    "Nearly round, the end of the corridor is framed in fountains pouring water into small bowls below.  The bowls drain quickly, creating continuous whirlpools within their embrace.  Above, a stained glass dome depicts a typhoon's might, with water feeding it from an enormous earthen jug held by a scowling, winged man.  Despite the forboding atmosphere, several scholars mill around on the grey marble floor."
