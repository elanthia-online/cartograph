    "The soil in the north end of the turnip patch is not in the best of shape.  Rocks abundantly poke through the surface, and a plethora of weeds encroaches on the planting area despite the indications of heavy hoeing.  The soil has lost much of its dark color, indicating that the nutrients it might have once held are either now in possession of the weeds or have washed down the culvert that flanks the area to the northwest.  The turnips are stunted and don't appear happy about the situation at all."
