  "description": [
    "The tiny foyer opens up into a small shop, the surrounding smooth walls cut with arches leading into even smaller alcoves.  Half-curtains of sheer lace generously allow the moonlight to spill in from the front windows, while several invar sconces add illumination to brighten the darker corners.  A small flight of switch-backing stairs carved right into the rockface climbs up along one wall.",
