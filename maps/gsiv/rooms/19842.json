  "description": [
    "Despite being smaller than the other gardens, this tiny clearing holds a reverence all its own.  A fountain bearing a tall obelisk sits in the center, water roaming down its sides musically.  Soft mats for meditation have been placed carefully around the grounds, each one embroidered in various symbols of the spirits."
