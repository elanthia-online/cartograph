    "Bright white steps mix with chipped and dented black stones in this renovated section of the tower.  Climbing further up the walls of the tower, the stairs disappear beyond a wide landing above.  Below, orbs cast an eerie green illumination upon an arch set into the smooth walls.  A series of small archery windows lined in silver gaze out upon the waters of the bay and the sprawling city below."
