    "A curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A bronzed drake sculpture sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on one side of the shop and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on the other."
