    "A few persons, cloaks turned up against the wind, pass anonymously down the winding path of Fear Alley, their footfalls rising from granite pavement to ice-covered wall and ricocheting among the smaller buildings in between.  From a rise to the south, the great temple dominates the district to which it lends its name."
