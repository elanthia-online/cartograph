  "description": [
    "Bright and verdant in the dark landscape, a single juniper tree rises out of the murky bleakness of the swamp and stretches upward towards the grey sky.  Concentric bands of alternating stone and brown grass surround the twisted body of the towering, berry-laden beauty and manage to stave off the filth of the nearby sludge-like mud.  Despite the calm of the area, an invasive humidity makes the air weighed with dampness and an underlying scent of stench clogs the senses."
