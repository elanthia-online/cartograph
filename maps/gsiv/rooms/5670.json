    "A few simple baskets filled with an assortment of nuts and dried fruits are resting near a large flattened stone.  A fine ivory dust covers the surface of the rock, and it looks as if it might be used for food preparation.  A small alcove dug into the wall holds several clay bowls, each containing a thick unidentifiable paste.  A stack of large broad leaves is also stored within this alcove, their purpose unknown."
