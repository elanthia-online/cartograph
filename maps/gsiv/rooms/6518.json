    "The prairie grass grows almost as tall as a halfling, and as the wind sends it swaying like waves, it produces a soft susurrus.  To the west, the double ruts of the road proceed toward the distant castle, glimpsed through gaps in the strange lake-fog that mantles the old fortress like a cloak."
