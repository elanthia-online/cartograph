    "Moonlight sparkles off the Locksmehr River as it rushes toward the west.  The current is very fast here, and the flow is interrupted by several protruding rocks.  To the east, a ferry service for crossing the river operates from a sturdy wooden dock.  The Vipershroud, a near impenetrable forest, looms to the south and west.",
