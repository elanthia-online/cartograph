    "The shouts of enthusiastic hawkers compete with the soft sounds of music playing somewhere within the market, the combination only amplified as it echoes against several large metal shields resting against a nearby booth.  The cacophony continues as a caged parrot imitates the environment, flapping its vivid wings in an attempt for attention."
