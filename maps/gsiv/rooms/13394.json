  "description": [
    "Verdant grass has been cultivated and neatly-trimmed, the lush carpet surrounding the modest house to the east in a blanket of deep green.  Smoke trickles up from the chimney of the house, dancing sinuously before fading away into the air.  A large target stands in the shadow of the walls of the manor, its surface perforated with a variety of tiny puncture holes."
