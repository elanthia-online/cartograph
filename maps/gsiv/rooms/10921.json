    "The small shop is crammed with cloth of every type and description.  Vividly colored bolts sit on every surface, and straps and fragments of leather clutter the walls.  The whiskery old elf who is proprietor of the mayhem sidles toward you, smiling craftily.  He is wearing a striped galabia, the long, loose robe seen in abundance on the cobbled thoroughfares outside.  Heavy incense scents the air, coiling up from a lit stick stuck into a brazier on the counter."
