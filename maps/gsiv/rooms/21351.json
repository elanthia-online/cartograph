  "description": [
    "This chamber is contained entirely within the trunk of the great tree.  Several small glowing globes near the ceiling cast a dim light across a comfortable bed that stands in one corner of the room.  A handsome desk in the corner holds a crystal ball, and beside it stands a perch with a stuffed raven on it."
