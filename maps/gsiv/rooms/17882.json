    "A large hand-woven cotton tapestry dominates the northern part of this corner, the colors somewhat flamboyant against the unobtrusive earth tones of the wooden walls.  The tapestry is either relatively new or meticulously preserved, and would likely fetch a high price in the marketplace.  A slight breeze from the south occasionally stirs the lemon-colored fringe along its bottom edge."
