    "Brilliantly aglow with a dazzling array of lanterns, this tent is spotless.  Long wooden shelves run the length of the east and west walls, displaying a magnificent assortment of expertly crafted dolls.  Below each of the meticulously displayed dolls is a wooden bin filled with the basic models.  A small display table sits just inside the doorway, while a deep crimson rug edged with intricate gold threading creates a wide central aisle from which patrons can browse the wares.  Hanging from the ceiling is an ornate gilt sign."
