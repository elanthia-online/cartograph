  "description": [
    "A welter of discordant sounds fills the air here, in sudden contrast to the relative calm of the surrounding streets.  The clanging of metal striking metal, the hissing of air and the roaring of the forge, and the gruff voice of the proprietor bellowing out orders make it all too clear that this is the entrance to Aznell's Armory.  A metal sign hangs above the doorway."
