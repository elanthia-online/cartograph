  "description": [
    "Set beneath a narrow window, the shelving and racks in this little pantry are similar to any other.  The contents, however, are not.  Front and center is a basket of hands, though it is unclear whether they are real or manufactured.  Propped up heads, turned to face a panelled wall, are spaced across the lowest shelf.  Alongside the peculiar array are fruits, vegetables, and a few sacks of grain."
