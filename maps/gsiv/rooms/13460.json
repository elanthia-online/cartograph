    "Ambling between quaint stone cottages, the lane is forced to turn back on itself at the foot of a steep hill that sits to the northeast.  Its wooded slope is dark with shadow.  However, here and there the twinkle of light can be glimpsed from the windows of houses nestled in the trees.  A loud chatter of tree frogs fills the night, and moonlight creates shifting patterns on the dark, mottled canopy of the forest.",
    "Ambling between quaint stone cottages, the lane is forced to turn back on itself at the foot of a steep hill that sits to the northeast.  Its wooded slope is lush, the green foliage interspersed here and there with flowering trees and the vivid orange-red of trumpet vine flowers.  Birds create a constant chatter within the leafy boughs."
