    "Pale purple walls surround this small room that is little more than a spacious closet.  Leaning up against one wall, a small table stands beside a curved grey doorway that leads out of the room.  Nearby, a young attendant stands ready to serve.  The focal point of the room is a swirling purple and grey portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Myriad toadstools have been etched into the metal, their various shapes and sizes creating a representation of a lush, subterranean garden."
