    "The cobblestones are quite worn as they approach the Viridian Coil tavern.  The area in front of the entrance is dusty, hard-packed dirt from the near-constant foot traffic.  A post stands on either side of the entrance, each one supporting a square iron cage with several thick pillar candles inside.  The rear of the inn is cast in constant shadow by the row of seedy brick buildings looming behind it."
