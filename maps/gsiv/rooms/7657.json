    "Your heart skips a beat as you look into the plummeting depths of the ravine below, into a lively, roiling underground river.  Above, the cave ceiling forms a dome with a jagged opening to the surface.  Through the opening, a narrow beam of silver light shines on the various rock formations and reflects off the mica deposits in glittering, hypnotic patterns.  A wide slab of rock spans the river, forming a natural bridge to the west side of the ravine.",
