    "You're standing on a narrow ledge overlooking a lake of solidified lava.  The domed ceiling stretches far over your head, catching the heavy air and shaping the breezes.  On the far side of the room, a frozen fall of lava plunges into the lake, its churns and ripples sending frozen waves across the lava sea."
