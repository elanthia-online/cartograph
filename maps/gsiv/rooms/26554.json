  "description": [
    "Cracked and covered with dust, the granite floor is difficult to inspect, and its only readily identifiable feature is the fact that it is made of granite.  Huge boulders pepper the floor, with massive webs of shattered granite marking where each fell.",
    "Crates of black granite and grey marble tiles sit on each side of the temple's central chamber along with wooden toolboxes of nippers, boar hair brushes, and sponges.  Small tubs of grout and water are scattered here and there next to each toolbox.",
    "Underfoot, a tessellated pattern of squares begins to take shape as the floor moves toward the altar, as yet left only half finished by the craftsmen.  A ladder is braced against a pillar on the right side of the temple, and a bracket fixed with an iron change is mounted near the top.",
    "The enclosing walls of the temple are black granite, smoothed and polished to a high gloss, while the floor is laid in tessellated squares of grey marble and granite in a dizzying pattern.  Pillars stand stoically at the edge of the sanctuary, and indigo-cushioned kneelers of ebonwood are arranged in diagonal rows to resemble a fringed arrowhead directing all attention to the altar.  Iron-chained ghezyte braziers mounted on pillars cradle smoldering embers that give off the sickly sweet scent of dogbane."
