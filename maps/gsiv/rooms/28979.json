  "description": [
    "Bright white stucco walls rise from the golden linden floor towards the exposed rafter ceiling, their stippled faces interrupted on the north by dark green shutters that flank glass-free windows.  Strings of frosted globes, each housing starflies and fireflies, attached to hooks on the rafters stretch in labyrinthine patterns throughout the room and provide a soft illumination.  Porcelain urns filled with flowers flank a pair of copper-bound benches along the southern wall."
