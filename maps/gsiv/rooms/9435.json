    "Vividly painted upon the walls is an idyllic pastoral scene with quaint cottages set against rolling green hills.  The sounds of dwarven families as they go about their business are barely audible beyond the doors of the artistically rendered homes.  Several of the windows are crafted with clear glaes, but drawn curtains shield the goings-on beyond them from prying eyes."
