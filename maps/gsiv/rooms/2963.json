    "Small, poorly lit cells line the northern walls.  High, louvered windows provide the only source of light for these dormitory rooms.  Some of the cells still contain remnants of furniture, though for the most part, they are barren.  The narrow hallway leading past the dorter ends at a narrow staircase."
