    "Small, spare cells line the walls, each guarded by a door with a slotted window.  Beyond, every cell is remarkably similar, housing a bed, nightstand, and writing desk.  Torches along the walls drive back the day's chill, but the dorter's entrance is open and doorless, waiting at the top of a narrow staircase."
