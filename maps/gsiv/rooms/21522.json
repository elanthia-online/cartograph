    "The anemic floral decor of the cottage is washed in silvered light that streams through a glass-paned bay window.  A curtain of mist hangs heavy in the air, nearly obscuring some provincial elm cabinetry that fully lines the back wall.  Herb-filled baskets and vials of oil are strewn about a flat-topped cypress tree stump serving as a workspace.",
