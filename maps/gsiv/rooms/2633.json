  "description": [
    "A line of people empties out of a pass to the north, too clogged for you to use as a route away.  They all await their turn at spinning a wheel, at least twenty feet across and lying flat on the ground.  Upon the wheel stand various figures: a reaper with a scythe, a being made entirely of light, and other oddities.  Each person spins the wheel in turn, and each in turn receives their fate according to the figure chosen on the wheel."
