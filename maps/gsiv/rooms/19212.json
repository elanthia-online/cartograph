    "A large bearskin rug covers most of the floor, with polished haon flooring showing between it and the cherrywood wainscoting.  A pair of relaxing-looking overstuffed chairs and an ottoman face a big ol' comfy couch with a pillow at either end.  A spiral staircase leads upstairs from the southeast corner of the room, and on the other side of the front door a wide window looks out onto the intersection of Nerite Lane and Eastbridge, lit by the glow of the streetlamps."
