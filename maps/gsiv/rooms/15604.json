    "Bright red and white patches in a handmade quilt give the bedroom a merry ambiance.  Gingham curtains hang at the window, their small checks the same lively contrast of color as the quilt.  The room's furnishings are rustic and crafted of pine.  A braided rug covers the floor, its muted tones a nice compliment to the quilt's bold pattern.",
    "Several candles neatly arranged on a small night table flicker brightly, lending a warm glow to this room.  Bright red and white patches in a handmade quilt give the bedroom a merry ambiance.  Gingham curtains hang at the window, their small checks the same lively contrast of color as the quilt.  The room's furnishings are rustic and crafted of pine.  A braided rug covers the floor, its muted tones a nice compliment to the quilt's bold pattern."
