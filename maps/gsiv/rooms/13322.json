  "description": [
    "Three massive turrets stand side-by-side, their stone grey walls marked with random slit windows.  Spilling forth from the narrow vents, lush vinca ivy and crimson trumpet vine flowers trail down in slender tendrils, giving the illusion of bloody streaks from a distance.  Towering doors of brushed steel have been propped open, revealing a dimly-lit narthex leading into the temple."
