  "description": [
    "Perched upon a substantial stackstone base, the banyon planked exterior of this large estate fits well with the foliage covered hillsides surrounding it.  A manicured lawn fights off floral intrusion from the neighboring jungle, while broad teakwood decking entreats entry through the open double doors.  A cushion-topped swing, wide enough for two, is suspended from the porch roofing, and adjacent wind chimes give voice to the hilltop breezes."
