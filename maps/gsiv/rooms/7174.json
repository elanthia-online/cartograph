    "A gnarled and twisted viburnum tree grows out over a rectangular hole in the ground.  Tall spindly grass and rotting leaves fill the hole, making it appear shallow.  The trunk of the viburnum tree is dotted with blotches of brown ooze, but sparse leaves grow on its thin branches, showing a fight for life against an unknown blight."
