    "The low, crudely dug tunnel to the east opens into a series of natural caves to the west, the dividing point a pale arch of solid limestone where the diggers broke through the cavern's wall.  Faint sounds of trickling water echo endlessly through the tunnels from the west and southwest, where the uneven tunnel floors slope downward."
