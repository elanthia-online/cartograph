  "description": [
    "Alternating teak and linden-panelled walls frame a number of plaque-mounted trophies, the preserved creatures each displaying various types of wares hanging from closed jaws.  A tall onyx-framed mirror leans against the back of the shop, flanked by a pair of iron-banded oak barrels serving as makeshift displays.  Posed against the right wall is a smooth alabaster statue, her etched alum tray pointed back towards the entrance of the shop."
