    "White lambswool rugs cover most of the fel floor in this room.  A mahogany bed and matching mahogany nightstand are located against the inner wall.  At the foot of the bed is a plush heavy cotton pillow.  One corner is blocked off by a lacquered privacy screen.  Pushed to another corner are an ornate wardrobe and an antique locker box.  A cozy leather armchair is positioned to view the distant falls through a large window.  A heavy cedar door leads to a rope bridge and back to the gazebo."
