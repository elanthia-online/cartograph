  "description": [
    "Stones in alternating patterns of ivory and snow white marble form a walkway held aloft by crystalline pillars and protected by a banister of twisted gold.  Bas-relief carvings of ornate crowns adorn the rear wall of the temple, which curves to follow the path of the highwalk.  Below, the plaza is a sea of bright stone punctuated by metallic-hued carpets and evenly spaced cushions in alternating hues."
