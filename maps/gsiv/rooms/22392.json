  "description": [
    "Spacious and airy, the antechamber features several statuary of notable dwarven figures throughout history along the white marble walls.  To the east, an arch with a silver-traced keystone opens into a richly decorated chamber.  Woven moss green runners line the hall leading north, further into the embassy.  Inset into the wide-tiled floor, just before a pair of carved marble doors, is an immense medallion of invar wrought with intricate detail."
