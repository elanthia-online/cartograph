  "description": [
    "Snaking along in a haphazard pattern, the tunnel weaves through a series of rock columns.  Each is carved in the image of a tree trunk, and the tops of the pillars fan out into a majestic representation of branches and leaves.  The detail is astounding, each stone leaf rendered in the image of its living counterpart, as if a true grove of trees had been instantly petrified and transported into the heart of the mountain.  The tall trunks stand silently, providing an easy trap for losing one's way."
