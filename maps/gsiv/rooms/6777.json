    "Fungus grows along the length of some greyed rolton bones that have been hung from the low branches of a pine tree.  The bones dangle in a circular pattern, surrounding a small pile of stones which are topped with the rolton's skull.  The silence of the forest seems to deepen eerily in the presence of the odd marker."
