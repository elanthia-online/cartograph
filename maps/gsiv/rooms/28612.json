  "description": [
    "Summer-graced foliage from brass laurel trees surrounds the rotunda, eclipsing it in a cool shade.  Dominating the rotunda with its elevated structure is a high dais, with a handsome statue resting upon it.  Handwoven rugs of a grassy green are spread at the foot of the dais, allowing worshippers to pray in comfort.  As wind breezes through the hollow forest, lilting and flute-like tones blend into a harmonious melody with the soft chiming of swaying honey beryl leaves."
