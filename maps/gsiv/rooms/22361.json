    "A set of broad mosaic stone steps sweeps down into the airy enclave which reaches exceedingly low depths.  Positioned directly at the bottom of the stairs, a sunny flaxen carpet leads to a great haon receiving hall table lined with backless silk-tufted chairs.  An intricate celestial marquetry composes the majority of the vast flooring, balancing with the smoothly carved pale limestone walls."
