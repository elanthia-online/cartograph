  "description": [
    "Large glassless windows surrounded by gauzy drapes decorate three of the rooms for green stucco walls, while the fourth houses an open black oak door that leads into the kitchen.  Two mosquito nets occupy the northeastern and northwestern corners of the room and are each suspended over a narrow knotty oak bed and a narrow black oak bed.  Sharing a space between the two beds, a long black oak table is draped with a fine white linen cloth and houses candleholders and vases on its smooth surface."
