    "An offshoot of the courtyard, this small piazza is open to the sky and bounded by a circle of pillar-supported arches.  A cobblestone walk leads east and west, while smaller flagstone paths radiate outward in a semi-sunburst pattern from a centrally-located marble birdbath.  Covering the ground between the walks, creeping phlox creates pale lavender and white wedges of foliage above which night moths flit from flower to flower in the moonlight.",
