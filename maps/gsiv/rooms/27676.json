    "Wider than it is deep, this office of the magistrate for defense is painted in alternating navy blue and black patterns with white trim.  The walls are bare save rows of perfectly aligned bookshelves containing volumes on Icemulian law, battle strategies, and war crimes.  A case displaying medals and insignia is hung above a scale model of Icemule Trace and surrounding wilds, while the symbol of Clovertooth Hall has been worked into the pattern of the floor in front of a huge polished cedar desk trimmed in rhimar with a world map and a pair of snowglobes on it."
