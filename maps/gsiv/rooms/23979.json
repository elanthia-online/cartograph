    "Teak walls burnished to a lustrous golden finish rise to a peaked ceiling made of the same to enclose this spacious area.  Underfoot, plush crimson carpeting spans wall to wall and front to back, and a series of gold-leafed shelves can be found upon the walls between golden sconces shaped like rearing wyverns.  An archway flanked by gilded brocade curtains leads further into the wagon."
