    "The fresco takes a dark turn here, and the paintings are worked with horrific detail.  A dark woman stands atop a ledge summoning hoards of undead while clutching a tattered tome to her chest.  The armies lay waste to lands and cities, slaying all in their path.  It is at the far corner of the hallway that you glimpse a small group of elves summoning a horrific magic upon a devastated keep."
