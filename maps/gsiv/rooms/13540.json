    "An oak-plaqued stuffed trout head hangs on one of the refurbished driftwood walls, and an exposed pine rafter ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is a heavy white granite counter on one side of the shop and some hammered copper display hooks on the other."
