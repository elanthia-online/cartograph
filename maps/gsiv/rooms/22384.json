  "description": [
    "Thin panels of rice paper supported by bamboo frames encircle the room, their smooth faces painted with various scenes from Eloth Ra, while panels of polished teak form the raised floor.  Beneath a window swaddled in lengths of rose and azure silk rests a a burbling fountain fashioned of bamboo poles and brilliant white river stones.  Set within a ring of plump cushions, a low teak table is covered with a painted service set."
