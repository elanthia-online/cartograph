    "Disorganizedly colorful may be the only way to describe this celebrated mess of a room.  Banners and cloths of every color imaginable are strewn about, some hung from the ceiling, and others gathered around stacks of props in the corners ready to set up an event at a moment's notice.  Beneath a round window you notice a miniature display of figurines marching in a parade.  On a small, cluttered desk, a festival permit application rests beside a bright blue party hat.  A handwritten parchment has been tacked to the wall that reads, \"Be back later.  I'm CREATING!\""
