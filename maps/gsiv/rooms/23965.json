    "The resilient architecture of riverstone has, for the most part, survived the decades-long assault of nature with a number of the some old warehouses still standing, albeit covered in vines both old and new.  Broken windows peer out like empty eye sockets, and open doorways linger like black, hungry maws awaiting a meal."
