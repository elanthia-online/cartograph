    "A soft, soothing melody drifts throughout the huge tent, the song originating from a white-haired human minstrel, who sits cross-legged on a giant red pillow, plucking at the strings of his mandolin.  A number of customers browse the shop's wares along shelves and a countertop, while a few stop and place some coins in a tip jar near the musician."
