    "The shadowy form of the mountain rising in the north dominates here as the jungle terrain thins to the edge of the coastal cliffs.  Moonlight shimmers on the dark surface of the ocean below the cliffs, and only a small portion of the southern expanse of beach is discernable through the dark shadows brought by the night.  The salty scent of ocean breeze teases the senses, and the wind whistles eerily through the few defiant trees and patches of grass still clinging to the rock-laden soil."
