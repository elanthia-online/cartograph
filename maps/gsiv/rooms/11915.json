    "A muddy brown river flows shallow and wide over a multitude of rounded stones.  The rippled water flows smoothly past the stones underfoot, adding its whispers to those of the winds blowing up the river canyon which stretches off to the east.  A wide path of hard-packed soil climbs its way uphill along the edge of the river."
