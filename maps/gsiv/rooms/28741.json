    "This room features a high, vaulted ceiling with carved stone trusses, creating a stark contrast to the cavern floor and rough-hewn passages.  Niches line the walls, the small spaces filled with trinkets and baubles that memorialize fallen defenders and the more noteworthy battles of Mist Harbor.  At one end of the room stands a large mithril-banded hatch which opens inwards."
