    "The burbling of the river and the buzz of the crowd blend together, and you can hear little else for the din.  A stout stone bridge spans the river Muagh, crossing east toward the commercial district.  Down by the river's edge squats a fat old dwarf.  He sits and stares into the water, mumbling to no one in particular."
