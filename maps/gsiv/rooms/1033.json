  "description": [
    "The rocky ground supports little plant life.  Clumps of hardy grass cling to what soil is present, and stumpy conifers force their way up through cracks between the rocks.  The trail drops steeply to the southwest and ascends in the same manner to the northeast.  The mists swirl as a soft breeze pushes them around obstructions in the area, and chipmunks scamper over the bare rocks in search of pinecone seeds, insects, and other things to eat."
