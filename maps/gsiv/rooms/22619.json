  "description": [
    "Blocking the sky with their interwoven canopies, a number of twisted and gnarled trees have grown to form walls around a field of swamp grasses and wildflowers.  Thick rattan posts support burning torches, which cast flickering light over a pair of long, shallow trenches divided by a 10-foot wide pit.  The remnants of previous battles lie scattered in and around the trenches, primarily broken sections of thick, rotted rope.  Just behind the pit, a red and blue sign is prominently placed at the edge of the field."
