  "description": [
    "Broken limbs lie in scattered heaps across the soggy ground, their ends clawed and chewed upon by some unseen animal.  A narrow tree-enshrouded path leads further into a thick wooded pass, away from the swamp.  Sprouting out of their rotting expanses are tubes of wild mushrooms with cup-shaped heads and blue-green blades of wildrye.  A thin trail of stones winds its way through the slogging mud and provides a solid means of egress from the area."
