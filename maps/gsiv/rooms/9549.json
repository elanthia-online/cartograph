    "Detailed emblems from the dwarven clans are displayed prominently upon the drab stone walls, while a miniature model of Kalaza rests upon a table in the middle of the shop.  The faint odor of ale permeates the air, though its exact source isn't visible.  Residing in the corners are large stone pots, illuminating the chamber with a cheerful white and amber light."
