    "Thick walls of white leather circle around to form a huge pavilion, each wall emblazoned with the image of a large golden crown.  A sweet aroma drifts from some candles stacked on an altar, where three robed acolytes kneel in hushed prayer.  Large gold-inlaid racks line up on the sides of a circular white oak table."
