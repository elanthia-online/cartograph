    "The Gladberry Farms Winery sits amidst an expanse of grass and willow trees.  The two story structure is delicate, almost graceful in design, every wooden surface stained a light shade.  The eaves and windowsills are intricately carved.  People wander in and out with grins on their faces and glasses in hand."
