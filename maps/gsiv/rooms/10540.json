    "Tall swamp reeds grow in thick clumps on either side of the muddy trail.  Clouds of insects assail anything that moves here, buzzing loudly and annoyingly.  The occasional croaking of a frog, deep in the reeds, cuts through the perpetual buzzing of the insects.  Darkness provides little relief from the humidity.",
