    "Deep armchairs covered in midnight blue velvet are scattered about, creating a striking contrast to the paneled walls of golden oak.  A matching velvet couch, flanked by a pair of oak end tables, sits before a large riverstone fireplace with a basket of sticks nearby.  Moonlight streams through the etched glass windows framing a ceramic urn of wildflowers.  Large pewter wall sconces provide adequate light, and shelves filled with a variety of books line the wall at the back of the room.",

Filled with wildflowers, a painted ceramic urn rests between two etched glass windows framed in sheer white silk.
