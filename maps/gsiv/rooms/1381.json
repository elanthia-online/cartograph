    "This portion of the trail exists only with the help of rock retaining walls and crushed stone made from the boulders that once stood in its way.  The new level ground has also been discovered by seeds and runners, and the edges of the trail are crowded with tall grasses and brush.  Above and to the east the trail reaches the top of the cliff."
