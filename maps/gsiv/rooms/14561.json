    "The territory inside the stone-enclosed space to the south is devoid of the dense foliage that the habitats to the north provide.  While a few bushes and trees have been planted here and there, it is mostly a wide open space with a small pond off to the side.  Several pot-bellied orangutans can be spotted lounging by the pond, whereas a group of chimpanzees sit around the trees."
