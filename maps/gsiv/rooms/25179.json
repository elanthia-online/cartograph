    "A low ridge overlooks a pool of water silvered by moonlight lurking in the near distance.  Its freshness fills the icy night air with perfumed sweetness, a scent accompanied by the dusky aroma of thriving sage and the croaking music of tiny frogs.  The life-giving pond waits down a long ramp of hard-packed sand worn away by the passage of many feet."
