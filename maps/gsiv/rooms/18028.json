    "Wooden modwir planks can be seen through the ice sheathing the roadway, giving the street its name.  Each of the streets in the Behlayr neighborhood reflect the heritage and available materials used in or around the buildings that inhabit the area.  Even the orderly way the streets are laid out resemble the clean lines of an evergreen."
