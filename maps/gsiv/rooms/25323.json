    "Chunks of orange and brown rust cling to the frame of the large round porthole that fills most of the port bulkhead, and layers of grime coat the surface of the glass, making it nearly impossible for any light to filter into the companionway.  Lumpy, canvas sacks lean against the open arch of the crew quarters, their tops overflowing with foul-smelling, dirty clothes."
