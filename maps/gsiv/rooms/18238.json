    "Encircled on three sides by polished brass rails, the small lounge provides an excellent view of the water, as well as a clear view of the deck and captain's wheel.  Benches extend across the open space near the front of the awning-covered area, while a small golden linden bar topped with delicacies and treats stretches from port to starboard across the stern.  Dangling from the purple oilcloth that shelters the lounge is a series of glowing glass globes, each flickering a different color and hue at random intervals."
