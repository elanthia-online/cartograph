  "description": [
    "You stand at the very edge of the roof at the back of the inn.  Red glazed, barrel tiles make the footing risky.  Moonlight glints off the spire of a minaret to the northwest.  A breeze carries the slightly tangy smell of the distant bay.  To the east, entirely surrounded by thick brambles, is a dingy, stucco building that appears long abandoned.  For the stalwart, a rope bridge leads over the brambles to the roof of the abandoned building.  A narrow air shaft leads down."
