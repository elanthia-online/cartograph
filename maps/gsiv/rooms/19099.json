  "description": [
    "Shiny brass lanterns hang on the wood paneled walls, casting warm reflections on the polished oak plank floor.  An entire wall is filled with wooden shelves containing rows of mannequin heads, each with a stylishly coifed wig, modeling circlets, hairbands, and other such adornments.  The merchandise on each shelf is secured against the pitching of the ship by a cunningly carved railing.  Near the companionway door, two circular metal racks display a collection of veils."
