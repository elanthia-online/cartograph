  "description": [
    "A thicket of gnarled oaks forces the trail in a sharp bend, the trampled ground curving around what looks like a small clearing just behind the trees to the south.  The oaks' heavy trunks are etched with the marks of countless crude hatchets, the moss-covered markings somehow forming a pattern reminiscent of ancient runes."
