    "Etched into the table top are what appear to be hundreds of tiny owls emerging from their eggs.  The whole table is topped by a sheet of thick glass which is bolted down, to prevent further carving into the table's surface.  Each chairseat is shaped like a cream-colored oval, giving the surreal impression that the patrons are also emerging from eggs."
