    "Here, within a thousand feet of the summit, you see a tunnel leading into the mountain.  The tunnel mouth is a perfectly rectangular patch of pure black against the cliff face.  A thick steel door, its twisted and mangled hinges bright in the moonlight, lies on the ground in front of the opening like a bridge or a welcome mat.",
    "Here, within a thousand feet of the summit, you see a tunnel leading into the mountain.  The tunnel mouth is perfectly rectangular, as though it were deliberately carved out.  A thick steel door lies on the ground in front of the opening like a bridge or a welcome mat, its hinges and bolt twisted and mangled."
