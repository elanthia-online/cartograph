  "description": [
    "A row of low trees displays a red and yellow bounty of ripe peaches.  A pair of human girls, perhaps six years old, takes advantage of this, though they've managed to get as much peach on their faces as in their bellies.  An old man rocks on the porch of a small, clay-and-wood home opposite the shrubs, one eye on his pipe and one on his hungry young charges."
