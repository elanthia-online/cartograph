    "Light filters in through the amethyst-beaded curtain to faintly illuminate this secluded corner of the tent.  The floor is free from clutter, save for a scratched wooden workbench and a battered applewood desk sitting next to each other.  A padded stool stands between the workbench and desk to create a tidy workspace."
