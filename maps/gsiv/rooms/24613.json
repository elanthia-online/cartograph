    "A small brook cuts across the meadow, running near the path as it winds along.  The water gurgles merrily as it tumbles over smooth stones and temporarily fills a small pool on its way to the nearby Mistydeep River.  An old silvery-hued wind chime, hung from the branches of a nearby haon bush, chimes gently in the breeze.",
