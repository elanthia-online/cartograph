  "description": [
    "A large pile of stones supports a wooden signpost in an effort to keep it from sinking into the brackish water that pools all around.  The wooden slats that once stood out from the signpost to guide travelers now litter the ground, waterlogged and illegible.  Tall bunches of cattails hide half-submerged headstones that line the three paths that converge here."
