    "From overhead, the sun glares down onto this open meadow, gilding the tall blades of grass and wildflowers with hints of gold.  Encircling the meadow are a stand of hardwood trees, their leaves vibrant, green, and glossy under the sunlight.  In the distance, birds sing softly every now and again, and the chirp of crickets accompany their song.  As the occasional breeze passes, the scenery wavers for a moment, rippling like a mirage at high noon in the desert before stilling once more.",
    "From overhead, the moons shine down onto this open meadow, gilding the tall blades of grass and wildflowers with hints of silver.  Encircling the meadow are a stand of hardwood trees, their boughs outlined in shimmering white under the moonlight.  All around, silence rules the glade, nary a bird nor cricket to be heard.  As the occasional breeze passes, the scenery wavers for a moment, rippling like a mirage at high noon in the desert before stilling once more."
