    "The dead end of this dark and quiet alley is practically a refuse pit.  The only sound is the creaking of the barrels underfoot as the current sways them gently.  While no rotting garbage is included amongst the offal, all other manners of debris can be found.  Boxes, crates, broken barrels, broken carts, discarded horseshoes, and many other manners of items clutter the walkway.  Only a mildewed door, with the letters - B A B S - scrawled across it in dried mud, is clear of debris."
