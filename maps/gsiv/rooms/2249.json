    "The corridor ends.  Abruptly, it simply melts away at the foot of a huge wall of metal so dark, the thing seems to absorb what little light exists in the gloom.  The metal is banded with rows of studs, each one incised with a strange device, and it is embraced on all sides by solid glaes, as though the mountain was forged to support it."
