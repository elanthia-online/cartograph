    "A large globe hangs in the center of this room.  Within the globe is a large patch of the glowing fungus.  A thin sheet of metal is wrapped around most of the globe, effectively blocking and reflecting the light on to one wall of the room.  On this wall is a vein of odd colored rock which gives this intersection a mottled appearance.  Obviously the Gnolls come here to study and enjoy this interesting formation."
