    "You find yourself continuing along the winding path that weaves among the thatched huts.  Near you, to the west, stretches one of the immense basalt legs of the great spider edifice.  The black stone walls cast long shadows and almost seem to absorb any existing light that surrounds them.  To the east stands a hut, its narrow windows dark and lifeless."
