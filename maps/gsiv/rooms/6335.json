    "Open windows let in faint moon and starlight along with an occasional cool night breeze.  The sparsely furnished room only has a few comfortable chairs and a big heavy desk.  A mithril chandelier that glows brightly without any sign of flame provides more than enough light along with the large fireplace.  One large plush carpet covers the flagstone floor from wall to wall.",
    "Light streams in through large stained glass windows, colorfully lighting up the sparsely furnished room.  The spacious room only has a large heavy desk and a few chairs.  A large fireplace burns brightly, but doesn't give off much heat.  One plush carpet covers the flagstone floor from wall to wall."
