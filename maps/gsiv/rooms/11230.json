    "Tattered cobwebs hang from the ceiling and cover the dusty, brass oil lamp.  Painted on the wall beside a wide staircase are the words Staff Only.  A dented brass lantern hangs from the ceiling.  Tiny fungi grow in the cracks of the wide-planked floor.  A skeleton lies crumpled beside the staircase."
