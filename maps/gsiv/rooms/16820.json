    "You find yourself in a small cell.  A sleeping pallet that is ten feet long lays along the north wall covered with straw now decomposed and black.  Lying in the corner you see a battered, oversize iron cup and plate.  A sudden flare from the torch in the hall highlights something reddish on the wall."
