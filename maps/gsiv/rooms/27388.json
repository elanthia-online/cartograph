    "A massive dock stretches far out over the river's surface, complete with large support columns at regular intervals, several slips for boats of various sizes, and a series of steps leading towards the swiftly flowing river.  The shattered remains of a large warehouse lie adjacent to the slips, and a ramp leads up to the Stone Eye veranda."
