Embedded in the riverstone and reflecting the moonlight, small silver stepping stones depict a large treble clef.  A private yet inviting atmosphere is created by the evergreen shrubs lining the fence.  The low building at one end displays a marquee over the carved door, beneath large luminescent blue letters proclaiming \"Icemule Theater.\"",
