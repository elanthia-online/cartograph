    "Two swordsman sculpted in grey marble rest upon a large stone base in the northwest corner of the field.  They face each other, frozen in combat, the sinews of their arms stretched and muscles across their backs bulged in a titanic struggle of strength.  Their efforts are, however, quite futile. The swords that once clashed between them have broken off, leaving nothing but the stumps of the hilts within their clenching fists."
