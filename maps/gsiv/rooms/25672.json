    "The gallery is a long, rectangular chamber with a high ceiling.  The only furnishings are a few teak benches, however the room is richly appointed with a number of large paintings covering its walls.  Vivid color combined with faultless technique and composition speaks eloquently of the quality of the works on display.  A deep-piled grey carpet covers the slate floor, muffling footsteps and providing a neutral backdrop to the canvases."
