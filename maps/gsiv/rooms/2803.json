    "The trail winds through its silent escort of pines, angling upwards in a gentle climb to the southeast.  Snow has drifted into irregular eddies between the dark trunks, the shadows created there cloaked in beautiful tones of purple, blue and grey.  A fine wind gusts down the path, sculpting the snow in languid motions."
