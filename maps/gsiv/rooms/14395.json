    "A clearing on the bank of Moonlight Pool offers a superb view of the falls across the lake.  The bank is carpeted in dense grass, and a large willow growing next to it arches over the water with long draping branches skimming the lake's surface.  Cabins sit peacefully in the clearing, silhouetted by light reflected off the lake."
