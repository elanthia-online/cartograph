  "description": [
    "Daylight pours through a kill hole located in the ceiling of the narrow inner chamber between the outer and inner portculli, illuminating a grim scene of abandoment and destruction.  Leaning askew against one wall are the remains of a once thick, wooden door with the hinges still attached to its sides.  Broken pieces of wood and gravel litter the ground between the outside and a courtyard visible to the north."
