    "The tree house is a simple, round wooden platform.  Interlaced willow branches form a wall about four feet high around the perimeter, concealing its dwellers from anyone below.  From above, soft moonlight bathes the aerie with its benevolent illumination.  Several benches sitting in a scattered array create an inviting rendezvous destination for a small group informally inclined.  To one side, a polished brass telescope is mounted on a pedestal.",
