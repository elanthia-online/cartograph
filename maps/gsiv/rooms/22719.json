  "description": [
    "Sloping sharply downward, the landscape falls away from the moderately level ground toward the debris-clogged watercourse that is tinged an off greenish-brown.  Barren trees are bent to the east, their spindled limbs rising like the bent fingers of withered corpses reaching for the heavens.  Random gusts of wind travel through the area, carrying with them the rich scent of loam, the pungent aromas of rot, and the fetid stench of decay."
