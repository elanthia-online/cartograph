    "A narrow passage winds through the attic among stacks of ancient crates and boxes.  An expansive but dusty window is set in the west end of the garret, looking out over the streets below, and an old velvet-upholstered sofa has been dragged out of storage for the residents to sit on and enjoy the view."
