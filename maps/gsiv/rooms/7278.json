    "The woods end at a marshy creek.  Cattails line the gently sloping banks, moving with the flow of the water, although an occasional rustle and splash from the plants lead you to believe there may be something more than water there.  Given the gentle slope of the ground, it looks like you could enter the creek anywhere along the bank."
