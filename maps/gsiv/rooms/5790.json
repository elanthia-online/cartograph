    "Stalactites cluster closely overhead, their dagger-like points a grim reminder of the incalculable weight of rock poised above you.  A few luminescent insects flit among the rock formations like bees in a garden, alighting for a moment only to move on to the next stalactite.  Flickering, but brighter light from the east casts phantasmagoric shadows on the smooth walls."
