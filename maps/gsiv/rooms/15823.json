    "Commerce Burrow sleeps under a shroud of darkness, resting up for the next business day.  The wilds to the east teem with creatures that pose a threat to the welfare of the citizens of the city, and it is well that adventurers pass through the East Gate to meet the danger even in the dead of night.",
    "From this prodigious height, the bustle of Commerce Burrow is truly impressive, even if the height of those doing the bustling seems much reduced by the perspective.  The wilds to the east teem with creatures that pose a threat to the welfare of the citizens of the city, and it is well that adventurers pass through the East Gate to meet the danger.  Below, the sturdy walls run in precise lines toward corner towers at the north and west."
