  "description": [
    "The northern and western walls meet here to form a squat round tower.  Archers stationed here would have a clear shot along the bases of both walls to deter invaders, but no one has stood at these posts for ages.  A stone parapet extends along the tops of the walls to the east and south from here, and some steps lead down into the guardtower."
