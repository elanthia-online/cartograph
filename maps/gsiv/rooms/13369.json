  "description": [
    "Blades of long grass sway in sinuous waves with every soft breeze, their deep green hue offset by clusters of bright flowers.  The quaint but elegantly styled buildings that house the manor's servants stand to the west, flickering amber light rippling outward from the arched windows.  The cobblestone path is slightly weathered here, and a few clusters of grass peek up from within hair-thin cracks in the stones."
