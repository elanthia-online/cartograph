    "Thick roots break free from the leaf-strewn undergrowth, rising up like grey tentacles, clots of dark earth and moss still clinging to their resilient skin.  The upheaval has disturbed the surrounding soil and foliage, creating deep holes and jagged trenches around the remaining cobblestones.  To the east, the massive trunk of a great oak rises from the shadows, its bark changed to a stony grey.",
