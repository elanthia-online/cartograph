    "Blasts of heat rush outside of a large, open-air forge, the thunderous sounds of hammer and anvil filling the area.  Blue and gold pennants are tied to posts sunk into the soft ground, each surrounded by a diverse lot of saddled horses patiently awaiting their riders' return.  In between two canvas tents, a halfling perches on an overturned crate, polishing a pair of riding boots."
