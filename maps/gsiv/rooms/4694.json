    "Here, just beyond an open window at this end of the narrow hall, the lights of Cysaegir appear like stars in the darkness. The smooth plaster walls have been painted with vivid, criss-crossing rose vines displaying various stages of bloom.  A star-inset ebonwood door and a cloud-inset white ash door face each other across the span of a velvet floral runner.",
    "Here, just beyond an open window at this end of the narrow hall, a house-shaped feeder attracts a number of birds with its delectable seeds and nuts.  The smooth plaster walls have been painted with vivid, criss-crossing rose vines displaying various stages of bloom.  A star-inset ebonwood door and a cloud-inset white ash door face each other across the span of a velvet floral runner."
