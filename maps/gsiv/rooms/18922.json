    "The area is composed of a stone platform, extending out from the main tower.  In the center of the floor rests a stone workbench and what remains of metal container sits next to the edge of the platform.  Burned into the floor are dark lines which form a pentagram surrounded by three smaller circular designs.  Moonlight floods the area, creating a surreal layer of luminescent silver across all surfaces."
