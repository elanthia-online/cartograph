    "Oak barrels line the edge of the linden and teak platform that forms the pavilion's floor, the filled containers housing various liquids on tap.  Tiered baskets descend on chains from the wrought iron ceiling, the latter of which is used to support the heavy panels of blue and purple that form the ceiling and walls.  A long counter supported by modwir tree stumps is laden with various dishes and pitchers."
