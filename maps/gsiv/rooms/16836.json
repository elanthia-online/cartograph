  "description": [
    "Smooth grey stone rises from the unadorned flooring to form a curving dome ceiling.  At the center of the ceiling is an invar cage filled with glowing mushrooms that gives the room a soft greenish glow.  Bisecting the room evenly in half is a polished grey marble bar, its surface covered with several copper-bound oak barrels set with iron spigots.  A smooth granite archway offers passage to the east."
