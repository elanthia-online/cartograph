    "Overhead, a mithril chandelier casts soft light on the patterned tile floor and floral-painted walls.  Two large divans sit facing one another, providing a cozy and informal setting.  Lush ferns in ornate clay pots have been placed casually near the modwir door.  In one corner of the room, a palm tree nearly obscures an odd statue."
