    "[A Derelict Hovel]"

  "description": [
    "Thin shafts of light seep between the rough wooden planks that form the walls of the hovel.  A broken glass window, now boarded up, allows for a faint breeze to drift through, stirring up small dust devils.  Near the back wall, a pile of canvas sacks and twine form a makeshift bed."
