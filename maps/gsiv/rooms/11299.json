  "description": [
    "A great deal of care was clearly taken to clean this room and make it comfortable and homelike -- care turned into a mockery by the ghastly collapse of the roof and walls.  White cushions embroidered with blue flowers are piled in a comfortable sleeping-nest in one corner, but the end of a massive timber has fallen to crush the vanity case placed beside it.  Animal bones, seeds, crystal shards, and bits of porcelain litter the ground.  Wilted violets lie desolately among the ruin."
