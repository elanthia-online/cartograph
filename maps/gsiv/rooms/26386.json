  "description": [
    "A thin strip of land meanders along the Locksmehr River, winding up and down in wide loops to follow the natural curves of the shore.  Dense vegetation obstructs movement inland, but a meager thinning of the greenery ahead reveals a sand-strewn dirt footpath leading to a rundown hovel."
