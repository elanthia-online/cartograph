    "A dull pale-blue hue emanates from a massive wall of ice, drawing attention to its surface.  Smooth as glass, the outer layer of ice is seamless except for a section of it that seems to have been cut out and removed.  In the depression is a deformed snowman, its face frozen in a comical expression."
