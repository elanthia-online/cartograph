    "Plain wool tapestries hang over the small dusty windows of this cramped room.  Poorly painted walls and a plain wooden floor leave little doubt that this room was constructed with basic materials.  Dust-covered shelves house cans filled with everyday items, while several pieces of cut materials lay strewn about in an untidy manner.  A dim light filters through one of the dusty windows."
