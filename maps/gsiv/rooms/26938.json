    "Rising from a perfect hole in the granite floor, a spiral staircase spills into the room amid a halo of five golden mirrors that reflect the moonlight in all directions.  Alabaster, carnelian, aventurine, onyx, and azurite tiles form half circles upon the floor, their open-ends facing matching half-circle archways that lead towards illuminated balconies."
