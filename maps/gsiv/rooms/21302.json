    "A grotto carved deeply into a stone cliff is hidden behind the cascading curtain of a waterfall.  A myriad of ferns, orchids, ivy and bromeliads hang from the walls, and a small crescent shaped pool has been cut into the moss-covered stone floor.  Muted sunlight passes through the waterfall, casting wisps of dancing white-blue light across the surface of the pool."
