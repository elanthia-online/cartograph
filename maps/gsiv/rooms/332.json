  "description": [
    "There are few buildings in this far corner of the Landing, and the eastern wall of the palisade that separates the streets from the wilderness beyond is so near that it casts a shadow over nearly the entire road.  Clinging precariously to the wide north wall of the sprawling brewery is the more diminutive square form of the cooper's shop."
