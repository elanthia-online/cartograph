    "The turret is dark and empty -- at first glance.  Then one after another, and then another winged shape swoops past your line of vision.  A look at the ceiling reveals the whole of it is covered by a vast complex of hornet nests.  Their papery convolutions curve around the roof's beams like a blanket, folding out here and there into incredible blossoms of living chambers.  Busy winged workers labor across the surface of the monstrous construction.  The staircase leading down looks exceedingly inviting."
