    "Rich obsidian carpeting covers the marble floor of this spacious office, contrasting with the alabaster walls.  Directly centered, an ebonwood desk with a matching armchair serves as the focal point of the room.  Bookshelves climb to the ceiling, their deep recesses filled with tomes, volumes, and scrolls.  A tapestry hangs from the wall emblazoned with the symbol of the Patriarch."
