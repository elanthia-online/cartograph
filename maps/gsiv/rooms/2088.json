    "A broken water wheel, half submerged in the middle of the river rushing past to the north, along with the burned remains of a building on the riverbank, suggest that some sort of mill once stood here.  However, you have seen no farmland, or suggestion of agriculture anywhere nearby that would possibly call for the need of a mill."
