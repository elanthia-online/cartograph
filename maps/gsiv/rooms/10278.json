    "Elderberry shrubs grow in and among the tall hawthorn, their tiny white flowers shimmering like pale ghosts in the silvery moonlight that penetrates the dense thicket.  The delicate fragrance of elderberry blossoms almost masks the reek rising from the ripped canvas bags lying beneath the shrubs."
