    "Resting directly below a small open window in the wall high above, this table receives a steady flow of fresh air in the crowded public room away from the smoky hearth.  A trio of beeswax candles cast a flickering reddish glow on the surface of the table, the light reflecting off of a glittering glaes mosaic embedded within."
