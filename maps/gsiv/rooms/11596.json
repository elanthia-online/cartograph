    "The wide-planked ash floor is badly scratched and scarred.  The shattered ribs and staves of broken barrels are scattered among the splintered slats of damaged crates.   A pale, glowing orb hangs in a rope net strung from one of the tarred oak support columns.  The tracks of some small rodent are visible in the dust."
