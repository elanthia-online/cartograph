    "Large display windows have been set close to, but not touching, the walls of this plush showroom.  Thick, plush carpets line the floors, encouraging the casual shopper to stay a bit longer and admire the wares.  Oil lamps have been placed between the windows and the walls, providing colorful backlighting and showcasing the high quality works."
