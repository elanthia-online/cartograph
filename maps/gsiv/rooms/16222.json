    "The tunnel narrows, as well as branching.  Occupying the space on the west is a carved panel, which divides the egresses to two other passageways.  An involved scene is carved upon it in bas-relief.  The lantern overhead hovers at the end of the chain that supports it, fashioned in the image of a large flying bee."
