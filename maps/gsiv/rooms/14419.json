    "Small renderings of each of the Arkati have been painted on the walls that ring this room, all gazing upward at the impressive fresco overhead.  Set at the center of a raised circle of black slate, an ornate grey mistwood throne carved to resemble an elegant tangle of thorned vines dominates the setting.  A row of torches behind the throne cast an uneasy, wavering light across the chamber, elongating the sharply-curved barbs into distorted shadows that creep across the floor."
