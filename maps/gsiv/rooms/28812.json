    "Beyond the kitchen door, the clang of pots and pans adds to the din of sizzling and popping food.  Several halfling chefs bustle about the kitchen, creating culinary masterpieces out of raw ingredients neatly separated along the surface of a hexagonal marble island at the chamber's center.  Just as many serving staff are dedicated to cleaning up after the cooks, lending an ebbing, flowing bustle to the kitchen that is reminiscent of a well-choreographed dance."
