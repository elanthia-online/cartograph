    "The lamp on the wall behind the table casts a broad shadow onto the rough wood surface.  The picture of a blackened cod fish that has been painted on the surface of the table is so plump that it matches the round shape of the table.  Oddly, the wing-backed chairs set at the wooden table have no arms to them, making them appear smaller than they really are."
