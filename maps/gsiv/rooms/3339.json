  "description": [
    "A low wooden tower sits on one side of the street, a sluice built off one side sloping down to meet the ground.  The weather has been used to advantage by the local children, letting ice form on the ramp to make a nice hill to sled down.  Some of the more daring have tried it on skates, judging from the body impressions in the snowbank built to slow down the sledders."
