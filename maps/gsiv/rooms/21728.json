    "Sculpted columns of woodwork support the frescoed ceiling here.  Intricately carved to resemble a Vaalorian Legion shield wall, tiny figures support one another as they stretch towards the rafters overhead.  Time has started to eat away at the marvelous carvings, the wood beginning to rot in several places."
