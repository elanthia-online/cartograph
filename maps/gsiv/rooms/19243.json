    "The tall hedges hem in this long, narrow area.  Thick poles deeply implanted just in front of the hedges support a roof of rough-hewn timbers.  A thick layer of grey gravel winds among tall bookshelves situated to form quiet nooks with lamp-lit desks for study.  Interestingly, the majority of the shelves appear to contain information on honing one's will, meditation, martial arts, and weaponry rather than healing arts.  Openings allow exit to the north, east, and west."
