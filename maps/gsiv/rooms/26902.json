  "description": [
    "Weathered planks of dark mahogany line the walls of this tiny, windowless space.  Multiple iron hooks, each mounted within a grinning skull bracket, display armor against the far well.  Conducting a thorough examination of each piece could prove difficult in the dimly lit space.  A fungi-covered oak plank is propped up, right in the middle of the floor, waiting to trip the unwary shopper."
