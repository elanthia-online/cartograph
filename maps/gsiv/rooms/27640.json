  "description": [
    "The walls of the cramped lab are scorched and damaged beyond any ability to discern the original material or craftsmanship.  Crossed out glyph symbols and scrawlings of ruined pentagrams indicate obvious signs of past research projects gone awry.  A variety of curious instruments and tools are scattered across the marred oak table placed on one side of the room.  Along the opposite wall rests a blackened bookshelf, an intact lor cabinet, and sturdy looking steel hooks."
