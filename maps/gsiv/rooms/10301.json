    "Erected on a rounded rectangular base, the room reaches upward toward a domed interior peaking at an octagonal oculus.  Suspended from the pendentives are large bleached yierka-hide lozenges, bearing stylized fiery images.  Large square tiles of alternating crimson and ivory ceramic begin at the northern archway, slowly dispersing into a mosaic of red and orange swirling patterns."
