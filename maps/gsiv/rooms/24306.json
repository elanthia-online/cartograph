    "Bright moonlight filters down through the foliage above, giving plenty of light to see by.  Most of the platform's space is taken up by a large pile of overstuffed pillows.  Sturdy brass railings line either side of the platform to prevent anyone from falling.  At one end of the platform is a simple haon arch and at the other is a sturdy looking pair of modwir doors."
