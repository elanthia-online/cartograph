    "Floor-length frames of burnished copper line the silk-draped walls of the shop, each one displaying a creature wrought from a variety of cogs and gears.  An iron-forged, clockwork vathor glares lifelessly at a brilliant, imflass-feathered peahen, the duo separated by a trio of pudgy, gornar otters wrapped in faenor kelp."
