  "description": [
    "The interior of the small shop is rustic, without much decoration save for a few examples of local craftsmanship displayed in the front window.  A long wide counter runs the length of the room with numerous bolts of fabric chromatically stacked behind it.  Adjacent to the counter is a rack of glass drawers, each one revealing glimpses of colorful buttons and buckles.  A clerk moves casually near three stands, draping fresh hides over their surface."
