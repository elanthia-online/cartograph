  "description": [
    "Sturdy shelves line the walls from floor to ceiling of this cramped space, covered with tinctures, books, and various jars holding different colored powders and ingredients.  Several tables bearing silver cauldrons filled with assorted colors are clustered together in the center of the room.  The wooden floor is surprisingly clean and creaks slightly under your footsteps."
