    "The shadowed walls to the north rise like brooding sentinels over the dark plains of meadow grass.  The chirrup of a cricket, or perhaps a small frog, rises from the surrounding vegetation, gentle accompaniment to the rustling of breeze-blown blades of grass.",
    "The city walls to the north rise like brooding sentinels over the sun-touched fields of meadow grass.  Clouds overhead cast fleeting shadows across the surrounding plain."
