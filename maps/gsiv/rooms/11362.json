  "description": [
    "Six columns of stone rise to the ceiling of this large audience chamber.  As your eye follows the columns you see a raised dais, upon which rest four carved fel wood thrones.  Each of these cushioned thrones is painted a different color: blue, white, red, and green.  Two tapestries are hung in this room, one depicting the founding of Elanith, the other bearing the seal of the Council of Twelve.  A skeleton lies at the base of the dais, obviously killed by a mighty blow to the chest."
