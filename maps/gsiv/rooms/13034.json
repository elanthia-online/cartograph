    "As the trail zigzags through dense growths of willow trees, it becomes more clearly delineated, changing from rough gravel to smooth river stones skillfully laid in a handsome pattern.  Over the tree line above, the gables of a large building can be seen, the rich sienna of its timbers peeking through the silvery green of the willow branches in places.  A small sign stands next to the paving stones of the path.",

Over the tree line above, the gables of a large building can be glimpsed in the bright moonlight, the rich sienna of its timbers peeking through the silver-grey of the willow branches in places.  A small sign stands next to the paving stones of the path."
