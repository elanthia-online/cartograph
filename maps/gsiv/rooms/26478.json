    "Arranged at an angle to two water-stained walls, a driftwood counter and a painted wooden sign beside it seem to be the focal point of the long, rectangular room that is cloyingly filled with an acrid scent of seawater and rotting vegetation.  Scrub marks are deeply gouged into the floorboards, evidence that someone attempted to reduce the stench and stains, and several lanterns dangling from above are arranged in close groupings in an effort to keep the bank's corners in shadows."
