  "description": [
    "Row upon row of bunk beds fills the large room.  Empty beds are neatly made while a few have sleeping Hendorans occupying them recovering from overnight patrols or guard duty.  Racks for armor and gear stand beside every set of beds offering ready access to their wearers.  At one end of the hallway is a letter writing station."
