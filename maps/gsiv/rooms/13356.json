    "This room is tastefully decorated in cheerful springtime pastels.  A plush yellow carpet patterned with pale green ivy covers the floor, coordinating the yellow curtains and pale green walls.  The large four-post bed features oversized pillows of yellow and green above an elaborately embroidered comforter.  An elegant crystal vase on each night table holds a small bouquet of crocuses."
