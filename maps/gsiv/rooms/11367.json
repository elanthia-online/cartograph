    "You are greeted by the scenes of a battle fought long ago as you enter the small guard post.  An overturned table lies in the middle of the room and the shattered pieces of several chairs lie strewn about.  Several dried, dark brown stains cover the floor.  Could they be the dried blood of the former guardians?"
