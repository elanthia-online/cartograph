    "Brightly-lit iron lanterns dangle from ceiling beams, competing with the moonlight streaming through the glaesine windows to illuminate the tables and chairs scattered about the pub.  A few barstools await patrons near the bar, and a small area near the back features a few musicians entertaining the guests.  The occasional whiff of ocean breeze eases its way in through the door as patrons come and go."
