    "Large oak beams stretch across the stone ceiling, the roughened lengths riddled with nails that hold aloft a variety of charms, talismans, and globes, while the corresponding pillars that provide their support are draped with fishing nets and strange carvings.  A long wooden plank lays across the top of two oak barrels to create a rustic countertop, which separates a ship name registrar from the public.  Open brass portholes ring the office, their windows thrown wide to display painted scenes."
