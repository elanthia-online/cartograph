  "description": [
    "You are on a small shelf on the face of the mountain, very near its summit. The air is terribly misty and above you lurks the bottom of a cloud, looking strangely unnatural this near.  The view of the lands below is spectacular and frightening at the same time.  The side of the mountain from this point up is completely hidden behind an opaque wall of fog descending in plumes from the cloud above."
