  "description": [
    "Huge labeled kegs line up on both sides of the room, effectively blocking the windows behind them.  Above the casks are shelves stacked with mugs.  An enormous table bordered by mismatched chairs that have surely seen better days dominates the center of the room.  Clean straw and nutshells compete in an effort of covering the stone floor.  Leaking its contents on the floor, a keg in the corner gives off a strange hissing sound.  On the opposite side of the room, twin barrels overflow with freshly roasted nuts."
