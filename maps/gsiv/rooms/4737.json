    "Surrounded by a bubbling stream and a canopy of stout oak branches, the granite outcropping feels akin to an island in the midst of a vast inhospitable wilderness.  Overhead, shards of light pierce the leafy overhang, striping the swift waters and forest undergrowth in dim light.  The steady gurgle of the stream drowns out any incoming sounds from the woods.",
