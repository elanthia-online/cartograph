  "description": [
    "Wide and spacious, the balcony overlooks the treetops and boulevards of the town below.  Pairs of comfortable wing chairs and wrought iron tables are scattered along the flagstone floor and near the hewn oak railing.  One table holds a chessboard, while a few others against the wall are elegantly set as if for a formal dinner.  Inset into the middle of the balcony floor is a polished silver lion rampant ringed by lustrous silvery moonstone roses."
