    "Suspended over frothing swamp water by ropes of braided vine, the tiny platform of packed mud and wood sways precipitously, like a ship tossed in a storm.  A huge cauldron of black iron sits at the platform's center, surrounded by a ring of blackened mud.  Waves of heat wash off of the metal, distorting the hundreds of winking candleflames burning within niches in the walls.",
