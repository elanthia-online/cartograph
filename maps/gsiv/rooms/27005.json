    "Bands of rippling red energy rise from the golden tile floors, adding their light to that of the protective dome that shelters the small valley.  Expansive darkness stretches beyond the translucent field of arcane energy, the endless infinite void held at bay for the moment.  In stark contrast to the nothingness above, the bright golden tiles that line the moon's pathways are painted with decorative filigree designs that represent life and birth.  A glass-lined sunken crater ring stands waiting nearby."
