    "The room is dimly lit by light coming in through an empty doorway.  Wispy cobwebs hang from the rafters, waving in the hint of a draft, and dust covers every surface, tickling your nose until you sneeze.  The sound does not carry far, but breaking the silence seems somehow iniquitous.  A pair of double doors opens to the north, while a small arch leads off to the west."
