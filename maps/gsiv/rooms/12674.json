  "description": [
    "Grand steps of once pristine white marble climb towards an immense temple that lays in ruin.  The majority of the roof has been ripped off the structure via some terrible force, only the pediment above the entrance remains.  Decimated statuary, toppled columns, and overturned brass fire bowls are among the few identifiable pieces located in the rocky debris strewn about the watery landscape."
