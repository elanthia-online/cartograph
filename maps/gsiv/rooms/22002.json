    "Faded and peeling, the aged fence surrounding the cabin is nearly toppling over, providing absolutely no deterrent for wandering travelers.  Thick wooden planks, secured with rusty nails, cover all visible windows, restricting view of the cabin's interior.  An old rune of dried blood is smeared above a sigil-etched wooden door."
