  "description": [
    "A pair of swinging white oak doors separates the kitchen and dining room, sealing off some of the noise from the bustling staff at work.  A large fel cupboard occupies one corner, its doors ajar, revealing shelves stacked with fresh fruit and prepared desserts.  The white marble counter is laden with cutting boards and a variety of knives and utensils.  A red-faced halfling chef threatens his assistants with a rolling pin as they scurry about the kitchen preparing dishes for the guests in the dining room."
