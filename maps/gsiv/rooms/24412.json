  "description": [
    "Muffled footsteps and quiet voices from inside the pavilion resonate through the roof, blending in with distant cries of birds.  The moss-covered roof lends an unobstructed view of the entire glade area, free from the brambles and undergrowth of the forest floor.  Random carvings on the trunk of the majestic oak have been whittled by previous woodsmen leaving their mark on the area."
