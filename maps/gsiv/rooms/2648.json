    "The mist from the pool lays a fine sheen on the ice covering the dais, making footing a risky business at best.  Above, the huge carved head of the drake slumbers in its stony impassivity.  The great eyes are closed, each immaculately carved with rows of spikes along the rims of the eyelids.  Fans on either side are tucked gracefully along the dragon's jaws, reaching back toward the shoulders.  Steps continue a northeast ascent toward a narrow ledge at the beast's feet."
