  "description": [
    "The narrow brick path winds lazily through a fragrant patch of pastel-colored wildflowers.  Sprigs of grass push between the crumbled mortar of the path, giving it a somewhat overgrown appearance.  The path ends at a small stone barn that extends out from the corner of the high stone wall that surrounds the cottage to the west."
