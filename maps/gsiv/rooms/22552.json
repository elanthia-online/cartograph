    "Warped and splintered planks of wood creak underfoot in this cramped, dilapidated structure.  Droplets of fetid swamp water drip intermittently from the sagging, rotting rafters and into several rows of crumbling stone planters overflowing with various marsh plants.  A rotted wooden trellis leans against the far wall opposite a battered door with rusted hinges."
