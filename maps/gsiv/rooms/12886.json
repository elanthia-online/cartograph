    "Set beneath the spreading branches of a laden apple tree, a booth nailed together from weathered wooden boards attracts the young and old alike.  Countless narrow-necked, small glass bowls glint brightly in the lantern light, lined up in precise rows on the top of a picnic table occupying the center of the booth.  Intermittent breezes stir up the long, pale yellow-green grass stems and ripple the water at the top of each of the fishbowls.",
