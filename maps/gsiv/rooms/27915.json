    "A thick, crimson wool carpet spreads across the grey stone floor, anchored at its center by a wooden table with four sturdy chairs.  A low bookshelf stands beneath a half-open window, with an upholstered armchair nearby.  A few off-duty guardsmen mill about, playing cards, reading, or polishing their boots."
