    "Circular in shape, the cobblestone tunnel stretches in a straight, uniform line from east to west.  Curtains of wax descend from a shelf high upon the northern wall, where fat candles have been placed to provide illumination for the area.  The scent of sandalwood rises from the cluster of burning tapers and staves off the more unpleasant aromas of the sewers."
