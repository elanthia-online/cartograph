  "description": [
    "Crowded with debris and irregular slabs of granite, the cramped temple entry preserves centuries of history, despite its apparent aging.  Sconces coated with a thick layer of dust emit a faint glow and line the moss-covered walls.  Ancient runic linework fills the center of the room and extends along the ground toward the south."
