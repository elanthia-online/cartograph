    "Dark wood paneling on the walls creates an atmosphere of opulence even amidst the modest furnishings of this room.  A threadbare woolen rug lies beneath an overstuffed red velvet divan and its low black table counterpart.  Tall bookshelves line the inside wall and a tri-fold wicker door stands between them.  A sewing basket rests on the table beside a pale ceramic soap dish.  Near the back of the room, an iron-banded oak trunk holds a variety of baskets and cases."
