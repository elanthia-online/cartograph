  "description": [
    "Carved directly into the cliff facing, long tunnels lead away from the railing-encircled, rough stony ledge.  Black-eyed yellow daisies peek out from a wall of bracken that prolifically grows around oak posts at the cliff's edge.  A set of stairs, narrow and cut directly into the bedrock, ascends to a logging colony surrounded by palisades."
