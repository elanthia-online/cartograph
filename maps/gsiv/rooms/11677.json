    "A layer of damp dust covers everything.  The shards of broken liquor bottles are scattered across the floor.  The wooden bar counter has been hacked and battered.  Dull moonlight filters in through a jagged hole in one part of the ceiling.  A set of crude steps lead up through a small trapdoor leading to the roof.",
