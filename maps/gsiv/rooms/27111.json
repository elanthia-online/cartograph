    "Making use of the large boulders shoring up the sturdy ground leading to the jungle, large seabirds bombard the rocky coast with clams and mussels.  Dodging talons and falling debris, small rodents race in and out of the rocks, stopping momentarily to gather seeds and pods before disappearing into their burrows.  Far out to sea, the ocean shifts from azure to a slate grey hue while along the coast to the north, vibrant jungle flora gleams like a glistening emerald in the sun."
