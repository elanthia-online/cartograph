    "A huge silk hammock has been suspended from the ceiling and is swaying ever so slightly from the gentle rocking of the ship.  It is held fast by four thick braided ropes that have thin gold thread woven within to add an elegant decorative effect.  A small crystal carafe and several delicate stemmed glasses rest on a fel nightstand next to the hammock."
