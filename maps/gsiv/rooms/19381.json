    "Blue, green, and red ribbons, their long ends left loose to dangle towards the water of the harbor, weave in and out of the various slats and poles of the railing that encircles the docks.  Benches frame the area and provide ample spaces for visitors to sit while waiting for passage to one of the islands.  Anchored to the pylons by enormous wrought iron hooks are dormant lanterns, their polished glass windows gleaming in the golden sunlight.",
