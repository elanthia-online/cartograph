    "Sparsely furnished, a rainbow of colors paint the walls as sunlight pours through the stained glass windows of the domed ceiling.  Mosaic tiles capture the image of a blood eagle with outstretched wings in the center of the floor.  The tip of each wing points toward a pair of dark-stained doors, one that leads to the office of the foreman and the other leading to the registrar's office.",
