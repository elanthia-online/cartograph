    "Moonlight accentuates the dense haze of mist permeating the area with its ethereal, smoky presence.  Cool, damp breeze infused into the climate by the rushing water of the river combines with the welcome respite from the sun as night takes its domain in the dense jungle.  Shadows dance upon the landscape, rendering the foothills and the rising mountain in the north almost indiscernible in the foggy surroundings, with only the thinning plant-life to indicate the change in terrain."
