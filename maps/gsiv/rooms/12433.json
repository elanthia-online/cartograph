    "Various martial trophies are displayed on the walls between the arched stone vaulting.  Candles on a brace of chandeliers provide adequate light, with reflections off the polished weapons and shields providing a kaleidoscope of colors.  The faint smell of leather oils and metal polishes fills the room, vaguely reminiscent of a barracks or armory."
