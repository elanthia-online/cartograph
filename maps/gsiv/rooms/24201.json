  "description": [
    "The wood planking on the walls in this tiny room has clearly seen better days, with odd color variations in the green, black, and grey mold creeping up the perpetually damp surfaces.  A pair of muddy boots rests beneath an unmade cot, and a small nightstand holds a few personal articles.  Overturned, empty liquor crates are scattered about and appear to provide the only seating."
