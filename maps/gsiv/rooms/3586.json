  "description": [
    "Tall stone walls stretch up, becoming ragged granite fingers as they arch and meet at the apex of the lofty ceiling.  The light is low, flickering from four large braziers, hewn from the rock floor and carved into the likeness of stocky figures.  Each statue bears its burden of a brazier with head bowed, their posture one of supreme sorrow and resignation.  A pattern of strange sigils crosses the floor, disappearing into the gloom of a massive arched doorway, which dominates the far wall."
