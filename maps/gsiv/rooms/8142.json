    "Pines ringing the clearing deepen the night's shadows, their boughs heavy with long, fragrant needles.  Although the trees stand back, seemingly respectful of the circle's perimeter, the invasive ferns have surrendered little ground.  They dance around the pines' feet, lacing among an embankment of boulders blanketing a rise that borders the clearing on one side."
