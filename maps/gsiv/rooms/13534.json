    "The northern wall of this hall is entirely occupied by a massive picture window that affords a dramatic view of the Manor grounds.  The remaining walls are covered with soft alabaster silk, a stark contrast to the gleaming pitch black marble floor.  A silver refectory table spans the length of the room from the east end to the west, with several long cream suede benches lined up neatly on either side.  Towering silver candelabrum, each holding dozens of burning white candles, stand in each of the four corners.",
