    "You are struck by the stark beauty of this chamber.  The oak walls are covered with beautifully formed ivy that catches the light to form intricate shadows.  Your gaze travels upward to a crescent-shaped leaded crystal window left open to the sky.  An impressive white marble bed rests beneath the skylight, in front of an imposing stone fireplace with a greatsword resting upon the mantle."
