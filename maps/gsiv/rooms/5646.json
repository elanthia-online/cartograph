    "The rough texture of the passage appears to have been dug by hand or claw and looks to have been quite a job.  A mass of plantlike tendrils hanging from the top of the passage partially cover a flat stone that has been pushed into the wall.  The face of the stone is completely marred by scratches and marks."
