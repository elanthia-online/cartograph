  "description": [
    "A tremendous mural dominates the bulkheads, portraying a silvery white moon at its gibbous zenith.  Two smaller moons, one dark and the other as red as flame, stand out against its pocked and riven surface.  Before the painting is spread a wide bed of white velvet, where neatly arranged wares have been laid out."
