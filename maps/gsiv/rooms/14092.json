    "A wide field of grass extends out from behind the schoolhouse, some patches of dirt exposed from the excess trampling of feet.  Various playground equipment shine in the moonlight, from seesaws to climbing bars and even a large sandbox.  The eerie silence of the night encompasses the area, a ghostly visage constrasting to the usual reckless abandon during the day.",
    "A wide field of grass extends out from behind the schoolhouse, some patches of dirt exposed from the excess trampling of feet.  Various playground equipment dart the lawn, from seesaws to climbing bars and even a large sandbox.  Dozens of children play with reckless abandon, their cares of daily school life forgotten for a period of time."
