    "Lined with tiny glass chips, their patterns on the floor create a bright mosaic whose colors sharply contrast the dark wooden walls.  A rounded stone basin stands to one side of a laquered oak door, its warm water glistening in the deep recess.  A large heated pool ripples along the length of the room, beautiful azure tiles coloring the bottom.  A crimson curtained arch leads out of the room, while three white stone stairs descends into an azure-tiled pool."
