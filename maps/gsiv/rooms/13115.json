  "description": [
    "Utilitarian in design, the foyer is tidy, well-kept, and illuminated by copper lanterns strung between several shuttered windows.  Twin sets of double doors face one another, one leading to the path beyond and the other leading into a courtyard that is open to the sky above while remaining protected by the walls of the building on all sides.  Garment hooks to the left of the entry are arranged beneath a set of wide plank stairs leading up to the watchtowers, and open door to the right leads into the office."
