    "Little of value remains in this bedroom -- it looks as if a tornado struck here.  All of the drawers of the now-empty modwir dresser have been ripped out and thrown about the room.  The framework of a bed is still intact, but the mattress and blankets have been shredded to bits.  An iron chest, hit by what must have been a massive fireball, has melted half into the floor."
