  "description": [
    "Colorful umbrellas tied to the polished railings have several tiny orbs attached to their edges, each glowing with a soft light that dispels the dark of the night.  Anchored at the edge of the docks, several whitewashed pedal boats gently bob up and down with the persistent nudging of the tide."
