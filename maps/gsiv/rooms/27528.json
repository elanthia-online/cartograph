    "A patch of cut stone blocks is visible in the center of the room's north wall, where several baldrics and yokes hang from a row of iron hooks.  A wrought iron rack stands centered in front of a similar patch on the east wall, and a set of oak plank shelves are mounted to the blocks of the south wall, while the room is lit by several brass lanterns mounted in the corners among the horns and abstract shapes of the dead corals that still cover the stone.  Fortunately, the floor has been entirely cleared down to the slate floorstones."
