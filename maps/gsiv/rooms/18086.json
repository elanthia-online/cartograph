    "[A Spacious Tent]"

  "description": [
    "Layers of yellow and green fabric make up the walls of this expansive tent.  Several illuminated lanterns sit precariously on wooden blocks, providing adequate lighting for the area.  A long oak table lined with tall-backed chairs dominates the tent, and rows of seats stretch back to the far walls on each side.  The thick scent of burning applewood logs provides a comforting warmth to the room."
