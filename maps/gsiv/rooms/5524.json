    "This is the tower's antechamber and was designed to be a death trap to invaders.  Only a single narrow doorway allows access to the tower's interior, and kill holes pierce the chamber's ceiling from the floor above.  An iron chute above the inner doorway still bears a dust-covered coating of oil, and the chamber's walls are fire-blackened."
