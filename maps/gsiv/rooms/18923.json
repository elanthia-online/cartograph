    "The area is composed of a stone platform, extending out from the main tower, and is mostly bare except for a stone workbench set in the center of the room and a series of broken metal cages strewn across the floor.  Moonlight reflects off the cages in luminescent lines of silver.  Part of the platform has collapsed into the pitch black sea below, the edges of the ruined stone floor marked with scorch marks and dark stains."
