    "Black iron braziers line the walls of the spacious chamber, their glowing coals faintly illuminating the well-oiled shackles and racks of instruments set along the rough stone walls.  A tilted wooden table equipped with heavy leather straps and brass fittings stands in the center of the dark-stained floor."
