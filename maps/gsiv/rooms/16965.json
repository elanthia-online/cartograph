  "description": [
    "Waves of pale cerulean wash over the surroundings, the walls holding currents of water that flow in twisted rivulets, the torrent held back by the translucent crystal.  Sparks of dark luminescence briefly flare to life amid the swirling streams of water, fading in and out of existence like the dark eyes of an aquatic beast.  A faint roaring sound echoes in from the west, and droplets of watery mist dance in the air.  A set of steps descends down through the center of the room's floor."
