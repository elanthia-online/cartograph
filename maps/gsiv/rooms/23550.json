    "Textured black silk walls rise from a glossy black ebonwood floor.  Just above a serene golden wyvern fountain hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a high arched ceiling completes the picture.  A iron-bound ebonwood chest and an intricately carved ebonwood stand stand side by side in the middle of the room."
