  "description": [
    "Tucked into a corner away from the tumultuous happenings within the tavern, the isolated nook affords a modicum of privacy and quiet.  A stained lor stump table is set squarely in the middle of the alcove, and the walls are composed of smooth hewn oak planks.  A matching oak bench with bronze rivets and leather padding offers a place to relax, while a compact beechwood shelf is nestled off to the side of the wall.  The air here is hazy with smoke, but a decadent aroma of peat and fig inundates the area."
