    "The narrow and circuitous route rings the edges of the deeper, darker forest land.  To one side maples, elm, and hickory rise up in an intimidating wall to the interior.  To the other side, a steep cliff falls away along the back side of the island, presenting a precipitous drop to the ocean far below.  Small animal tracks can be glimpsed underfoot, partially hidden by the waist-high grasses."
