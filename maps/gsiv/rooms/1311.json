    "The trail reaches a pass through the mountain range and although Zeltoph towers over the trail to the east and Wehntoph to the west, the air is thin enough to make breathing a bit difficult.  The glorious vista mesmerizes even the most hardened of travellers as they gaze upon the foothills to the north."
