    "Placed in opposite corners of the room, identical flowerpots overflow with remarkable specimens of petunias, from the deepest shade of purple to a pale pink.  Globed lanterns dangle from slim, wrought iron poles embedded into the stone floor.  The soft light from within the lanterns creates a dizzying dance of shadows along the walls.  A lone chair occupied with only a leather-bound tome rests directly beneath one of the lanterns.  Sticking out from between the pages is the feather of a blood eagle."
