    "A hedge grows up beside the trail, its spiny branches thick with foliage.  Wildflowers grow at the base of the hedge, ringing the lane with bright blue flowers.  The lake stretches away to the east, silent and mysterious with its cloak of drifting mist.  A row of houses stands facing it, as if mesmerized by the water's lullaby."
