    "Bloodstains, some of them fresh and some old, cover the floor surrounding a padded black leather chair with wide arms and the stool settled next to it.  An iron-hinged wooden supply chest, its heavy lid thrown open to display the contents within, sits near a low mahogany table covered in medicinal teas.  An embroidered tapestry hangs prominently on one wall of the tent, the fabric swaying with every movement of the canvas.  Segmenting off a small section near the back of the tent is a bloodstained linen curtain, its edges slightly tattered from heavy use.",
