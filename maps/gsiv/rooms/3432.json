    "The Library is lined with ceiling-height bookcases.  Each shelf is filled with a variety of leather-bound tomes, some thick, others thin, but all obviously unused.  The feature which is receiving the most attention in this richly carpeted room is the paneled cherrywood bar, which stands off to one side."
