  "description": [
    "Time and many seasons of tides have ruined the outer parts of the structure almost beyond use.  You cling to precarious handholds along the rotted wood as bits and pieces break off under your grip.  The entire aging construction sways and moans with each passing surge of the waves and you wonder just what keeps the whole thing from sliding into the bay."
