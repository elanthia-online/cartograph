    "Black sand covers the floor, creeping into the crevices of each rough pillow placed upon it.  Backlit by small votive candles are statues of the Lords and Ladies of Lornon, all the more sinister for their obscured features.  The shadows thrown by the figurines are long and eerie, dancing erratically over the floor as if taunting all who would enter."
