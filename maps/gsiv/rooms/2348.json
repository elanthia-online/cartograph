    "The two halves of this room have been covered--ceiling, walls, and floor--with black granite and grey marble.  Meeting seamlessly in the middle, the two kinds of stone have been carved into gently sloping, crenulated curves.  Set against the backdrop of a bas-relief carving in the grey northern wall is an altar of misty white vaalin, while an altar of snowflake obsidian lies at the foot of the granite southern wall."
