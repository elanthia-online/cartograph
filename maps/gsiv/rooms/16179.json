  "description": [
    "A rotting wooden ladder hangs over the side of the parapet, leading several feet down towards the courtyard before ending abruptly with much of the journey down left to go.  A stone window built off a ledge next to the parapet offers a glimpse into the interior of the keep.  Several portions of the crenellation have fallen away, leaving gaps in the top of the wall and a view of the keep's surrounding earthworks below."
