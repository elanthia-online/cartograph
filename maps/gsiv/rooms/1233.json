    "The scent of rotting vegetation and decaying animal life gives the mists a peculiar odor.  On one side of the trail, almost hidden by the brambles and the shadowy darkness, a stump has broken open revealing a large termite nest.  Transparent white, bulbous termites, standing out brightly against the blackness of the decomposed wood, scurry about, attempting to repair the damage.",
