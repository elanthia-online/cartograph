    "The var, with its silvery blue cobblestones and frame of blue-lit silver torches, makes a straight shot out of Shimmarglin Court after following a curvy detour around the back of the Shimmarglin Inn.  The back of the building is tall and nearly as wide as the street, but ornately set with stained glass lancet windows, which break up its bulk.  A marble-clad shop sits nearby, dwarfed by the immense Inn.",
