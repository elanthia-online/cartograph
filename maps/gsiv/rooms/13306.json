  "description": [
    "Sculpted rose bushes ring the bower, their thin trunks adorned with violet ribbon streamers.  A white silk runner covered with scattered rose petals of all colors extends towards a trellis sheltering a statue of Oleani and Phoen in a passionate embrace.  A small grove of tanik trees barely conceals two tiny cottages from prying eyes."
