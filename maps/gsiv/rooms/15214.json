    "An oil-filled brass sconce hangs on one of the ribbed black willow walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A scarlet torch ginger-filled vase sits in one corner of a dark-stained oak floor.  There is a glaes-covered haon display case on one side of the shop and an iron-banded ebonwood chest on the other."
