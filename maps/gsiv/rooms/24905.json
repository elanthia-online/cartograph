  "description": [
    "Layers upon layers of black-painted palm fronds create a sheltering roof, while thick tree trunks rising up out of the ground provide support.  One side of the hut is a solid wall, constructed of close-set bamboo poles and splattered with dried-up fruit, while the other sides are without walls.  The mud-packed floor is dug out in areas, where the holes are filled with the charred remains of small cooking fires, likely the cause of the smoky scent filling the air."
