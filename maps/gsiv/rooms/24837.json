    "Jutting out of one of the slick earthen walls and over the inky black pool of water, the spacious ledge sits at a slight angle.  Small cracks in the wall splinter in such a way as to create several natural niches.  The sounds of dripping water and the occasional whistling of gusts of wind mix unrythmically with the flow of the river water."
