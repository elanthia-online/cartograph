    "A stone fountain sits in the center of this circular chamber.  In the basin is a statue, arms raised high.  The basin itself is filled with a foamy brown sludge.  The stone walls are covered with a fetid purple fungus, and you gag at the sulphurous smell.  A narrow corridor leads off to the north."
