    "Frosted globes dangle from the ceiling to provide ample illumination for the spacious library, while white pine bookcases laden with books line the walls from floor to ceiling.  A brass and oak lectern stands at the center of a double archway leading deeper into the structure, though a golden cord stretched across the entry prevents further passage in that direction."
