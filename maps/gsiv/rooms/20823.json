    "The darkness is oppressive as you step behind the waterfall into a small cavern.  The rock walls are completely black from being scorched by some untold intense fire.  A large body-sized onyx altar dominates the center, liquid still fresh on its surface.  The absence of any gods' names or visages shows that the disciples of these gods respect their desire for anonymity."
