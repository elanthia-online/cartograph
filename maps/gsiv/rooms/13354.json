    "This expansive chamber features a heavy oak bench that runs along each of the greystone walls.  On the wall opposite the archway leading from the cloister is a black granite speaker's rostrum.  The ceiling is crossed with sturdy ironwood beams from which hang a number of banners designating the guilds and professions that operate within the city."
