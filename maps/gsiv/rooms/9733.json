    "Sinuous, root-like veins break the smooth floor of the hall as they creep slowly back and forth from the center of the tree outward.  Debris--leaves and other, perhaps best not identified substances--is pushed slowly towards a circular portal to the west.  A spiraling set of stairs leads down the western wall and a corridor continues around the edge of the tree to the northeast."
