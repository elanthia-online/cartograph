  "description": [
    "A cool temperature makes the cellar at Baile Dragan an ideal storage area.  The room is filled with kegs of ale and cider and racks of bottled wines, some labeled with the finer vintages of decades past.  Neatly stored in the room are sacks of potatoes and root vegetables, armor and weapons, and other sundry goods necessary for the running of such an establishment.  A small niche is outfitted with a wooden table, a wash tub, and an iron brazier."
