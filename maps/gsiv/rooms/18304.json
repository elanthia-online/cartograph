    "Woody vines hang in the shadows from the nearby trees, looking like slimy locks of hair in the dimness.  Light is at a premium in the depths of night, the faint luminescence from a few toadstools offering what little ambient illumination can be found.  Hindering travel, ankle-deep mud spreads across the ground, the overpowering scent of decay rising from its surface."
