    "Varnished ebonwood walls rise from an enameled hardwood floor.  Just above a colorful seashell collection hangs a woven floral tapestry, and an ebonwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  An aqua-hued seaglass display and a vine-carved mahogany table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
