    "An assortment of fishing equipment is prominently displayed on the glimmering racks that are carved right out of the shack's walls.  Miniature potted toadstools illuminate the cozy space with variable hues of soft white, blue, and peach.  Tacked onto a hanging bulletin board are the names of fishermen with descriptions of their prize catches."
