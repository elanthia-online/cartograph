    "Carved into a rise in the stone of the subterranean plateau, crude steps ascend toward a great figure of green stone at the rock formation's peak.  Luminous fungi clinging to the cavern's far-off ceiling halo the figure in pale blue and green light, ominously silhouetting tentacles swarming around the great effigy."
