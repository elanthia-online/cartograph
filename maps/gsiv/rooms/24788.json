  "description": [
    "The stone mortar and heavy woodwork of this large comfortable room gives the place a rustic feel.  Across from a large fireplace is a spacious bed that is covered with warm bearskins.  A tall, narrow window is set in the center of the opposite wall.  From somewhere in the darkness a gleam catches your eye and you turn to regard a miniature dragon which rests upon a small shelf."
