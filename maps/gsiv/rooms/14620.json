    "A small pool dominates the clearing, casting reflections off its mirror-like surface.  Trees arch over it, their boughs creating enough shade to define the light into bright beams, which strike the surface of the water like magical energy flowing down in a stream from above.  Ferns crowd the water's edge, stretching in a lush green carpet from the bank, up to the doors of cabins built discretely within the trees around the glade."
