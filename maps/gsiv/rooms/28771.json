  "description": [
    "Heavy steps of sprucewood proceed up to the double-doored entrance to the rustic hunting lodge, a large, low building with a natural-cut pine facade and high rooftops crowned by slate shingles.  Each of the doors bears a sharp pyrograph of a charging mule accompanied by stylized gusts of wind, the device repeated in a mosaic of many woods laid into the raised porch.  Through the wide glass windows east of the entrance, a roaring hearth crackles, throwing back the cold dark of the night."
