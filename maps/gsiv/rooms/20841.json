  "description": [
    "This pure golden ora-plated temple holds eight glorious tapestries bearing the crests of the Great Elven Houses.  The centerpiece of the room is a slender mithril case securing an ancient elven crown atop a gold pillow, which is encircled by carving on the floor below that reads, \"For The Day Eight Houses Become One.\"  In front of the open window overlooking the Elven Empire, a white stone table surrounded by eight seats has been masterfully hand-crafted and polished to a reflective sheen."
