    "An expansive grand ballroom boasts velvet brocade draperies with gold tasseled cords and gilded candelabra, giving the chamber an elegant and festive ambiance.  Ornate columns circle the room and are reflected on the polished floor.  The decor is set into rich contrast with the verdant green of the gardens outside glimpsed from large, arched windows."
