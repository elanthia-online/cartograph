    "The warm and friendly atmosphere of this room can be mainly attributed to the large roaring fireplace strategically placed dead center along the eastern wall.  Various weapon crafting implements have been pushed over against the wall opposite the fireplace. A pile of old comfortable cushions fills one corner of the room near the entrance."
