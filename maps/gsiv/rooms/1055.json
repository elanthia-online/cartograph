    "A dense forest extends off to the southwest and west, its trees spaced unnaturally close.  Healthy bramble and holly growth covers the forest floor beneath the trees even though the upper canopy appears too thick to allow much nourishing sunlight to penetrate to the lower levels during the day.  Laughter and other sounds of revelry are audible, but it is difficult to discern from which direction they come.  The trail leads south, skirting the forest, and northeast, out into the open, treeless moor.",
