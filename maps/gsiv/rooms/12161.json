    "Topped by maroon glaes trim, the crenellated, oaken bulwarks that surround this deck create a fantastic blend of ship and castle.  Immediately aft of the foremast, the galley chimney rises through the middle of the steam grating: a cylinder of heat-discolored black iron surrounded by a gleaming symmetry of ebon glaes.  Aft of the grating stands the belfry, itself a testimony to the skill of the glaes-crafters' art."
