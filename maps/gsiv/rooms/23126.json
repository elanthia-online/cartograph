    "[Ancient Passage]"

  "description": [
    "Grey, time-worn limestone walls provide a grim atmosphere to this wide hallway.  The high ceiling and thick layer of pale silt covering the floor provide hints that the passage may once have boasted a smooth, plaster veneer.  A crack at the top of the north wall splits into three as it runs west along the ceiling."
