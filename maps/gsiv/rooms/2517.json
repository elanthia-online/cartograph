    "The view is remarkable from your vantage point at the top of this plateau as you stop to rest.  You gaze north to find the snow-blown expanse of the tundra stretching as far as the eye can see.  To the southwest, the jagged magnificence of the Blue Glacier Mountains rises to great heights and embraces the clouds."
