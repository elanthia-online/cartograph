    "Some of the smaller crevices manage to fracture all the way to the edge in this area.  However, they are thin enough that the area can be traversed by hopping from basalt island to basalt island, careful to stay near the plateau's edge for orientation and to clear each crack well.  Words shouted into the crevices do not return echos, and items dropped do not send back the sound of hitting bottom."
