    "Severed animal heads in various stages of taxidermy hang from the ridgepole of this musty canvas tent.  Large racks of antlers, mounted on wooden posts, display an assortment of stiff leather boots.  Tanned leather goods and scraps of various hides lay piled upon a workbench.   Beside it, a large snapping turtle carapace has been turned upside down and filled with a collection of leather gloves."
