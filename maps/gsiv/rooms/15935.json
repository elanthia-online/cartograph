  "description": [
    "Set with oak double doors in each wall, this large room is lit by oil-lamps that hang from the ceiling.  A stone fireplace rests in one corner, with a basket of sticks nearby.  Around the fireplace, thirteen portraits of battle-arrayed persons have been hung, while a large collection of paintings adorns the remaining walls.  Bearskin rugs cover the floor, comfortable leather couches line the walls, and there is a sturdy wastebasket adjacent to the fireplace."
