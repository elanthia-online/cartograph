  "description": [
    "This modest space is filled with an endless array of filing cabinets and has been sparsely decorated with a few odds and ends.  The walls are painted a light shade of violet, and a fir-framed vellum calendar hangs in the center of the western one.  Closer to the eastern wall, an antique wooden abacus occupies one corner of a neatly stacked plain desk, a comfortable-looking guest chair with dark violet cushioning placed just in front of it."
