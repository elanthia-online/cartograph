  "description": [
    "You find yourself in a dense wooded area in front of a small cottage with stone steps leading up to the front door.  Two large, well tended flower beds on either side of the steps contain a huge variety of plants of differing colors and sizes.  The night air is cool and refreshing and you hear the muffled sounds of the unseen wildlife in the trees surrounding you and from the river beyond.",
