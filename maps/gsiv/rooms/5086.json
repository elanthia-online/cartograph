    "Off the path to the north, a large stone has been carved smooth on top, seemingly to be used as some sort of table or altar.  Piles of animal bones and ruined, improperly stretched skins litter the area surrounding the stone.  Tree stumps dot the hills, indicating the regular cutting of firewood."
