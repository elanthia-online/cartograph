    "Ornate gilt-framed mirrors line the ivory walls, reflecting back the neat arrangement of velvet-covered chairs and glass-topped tables around the room.  A mosaic of gold and silver moonstone tiles subtly outline a walkway in the center of the roseate marble floor, leading to the foot of a sweeping staircase.  Crystal candelabra cast a soft glow and each, by means of clever positioning, illuminates a discrete seating section."
