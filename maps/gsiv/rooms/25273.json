    "The scent of jasmine wafts from candles burning at all corners of this room.  A tidy rune-carved study desk rests next to a handsome bookcase filled with volumes of lore and spells.  The thick black woolen rugs are arranged to provide two cozy resting areas, one containing a canopy bed with a feather mattress and black lace and satin fabrics.  The other has two overstuffed black leather sofas facing each other, a solid glass table between.  The walls are adorned with a gossamer fabric."
