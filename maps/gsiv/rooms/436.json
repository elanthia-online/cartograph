    "Clear grassland stretches far to the southwest, a futile lesson in the immensity of Elanith.  To the northwest, the grassy plain gives way to a smattering of pines that dot the landscape.  Immediately east of you looms the high wooden wall of the Landing which provides you with a sense of security against all the unknown things that may lurk in plain and forest alike.",
    "To the southwest, the immense grasslands have begun to fade, replaced by twisted brown weeds and rotting undergrowth.  To the northwest, once mighty pine trees have become bent with decomposition, their skeletal branches barren and gnarled."
