    "Dark shapes flit in and out of an open-bottomed cage that hangs down from the modwir ceiling and rests against the wall.  A sharp, pungent odor comes from a small pile of droppings that has collected on the stone floor underneath the cage.  Tucked into one corner is a small wicker basket.  On the other side of the room are a gilded oak table and a brick-edged murky pool."
