    "A cold, grey mist swirls around you, making it difficult to gain any sense of what is here.  Through the haze a huge, gnarled hand stretches upward reaching grimly for something past your vision.  As you move closer, it turns out to be only a dead tree, the bent and gnarled limbs twisting toward a blood eagle hovering just out of reach."
