    "Deep ruts in the dirt road give testament to the amount of cart and foot traffic in the area.  Several wooden open air sheds lie just off the roadway and might afford some protection from a sudden storm or a quick nights rest.  To the southwest, the massive walls of a large city rise in the distance."
