    "Tapering to a lower pitch, the ceiling of the chamber is arrayed in dusky-hued lichen and fungus, the odd patch here and there luminescing with an errie cyan glow.  Shelves once attached to the walls hang now barely clinging to the stone, their contents discarded and broken.  A lone iron-sconced torch burns fitfully as the floor rises to an upward-inclined ramp.",
