  "description": [
    "Gold-trimmed, dark green walls surround this small room that is little more than a spacious closet.  Leaning up against one wall, a small table stands beside a curved mottled green doorway that leads out of the room.  Nearby, a young attendant stands ready to serve.  The focal point of the room is a swirling green and gold portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Intricate foliage has been etched into the metal, the vines intertwining to form a complex lattice pattern."
