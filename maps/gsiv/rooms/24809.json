    "The beech's dense canopy parts uncharacteristically above this slim elbow of branch to create a leaf-fringed opening to the sky.  Sunlight penetrates to the smooth trunk of the tree to illuminate the swirling initials \"FS\" in the silvery bark.  The letters are not cut but formed by curious folds, as though some sylvan spirit teased the living bark to its will, or it's simply the accidental literacy of some flaw in the bark's woody structure."
