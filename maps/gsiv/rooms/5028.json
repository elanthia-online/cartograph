    "Small burrows dot the earth where the thick grass borders the trail, home to some unseen ground dweller.  A low, muddy patch in the trail shows evidence of footprints of large, orclike creatures.  Some large bird of prey, its species unidentifiable in the darkness, perches on an outstretched branch of a nearby acacia, scanning the expanse of grass for its next meal.",
