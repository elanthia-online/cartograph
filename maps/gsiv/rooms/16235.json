    "A breeze rounds the turn of the walk, carrying the aroma of baking pastries.  The Promenade is paved with an attractive pattern of tiles, its light and dark contrasts creating an octagonal motif.  Alternating mosaics depicting tarts, cookies and cupcakes alternate every few feet along the corridor's length."
