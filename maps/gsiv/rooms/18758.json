    "Wide blue-washed sandstone floors stretch down the hallway, covered down the middle with a light acantha green carpet.  A carved apple wood staircase curves upwards, and vertical matching apple wood moldings occur along the walls at regular intervals with limestone-potted sweetferns at the base of each.  A slender doorway pierces the wall opposite the staircase, while a large vine-limned archway leads east to a foyer."
