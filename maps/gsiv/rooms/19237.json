    "Huge green hedges ring this large open area.  The hedges rise nearly fifteen feet and intertwine tightly, preventing passage through them.  At all eight points of the compass, however, openings wide enough to walk through appear in the hedges.  A torchlit marble fountain in the center of the area sprays a steady stream of water upward, falling back to cascade down several tiers to the large pool at the bottom.  Near the northeast corner, a glowing silver portal stands."
