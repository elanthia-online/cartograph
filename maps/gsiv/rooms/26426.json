    "Silk in a variety of colorful hues wraps about thick tigerwood poles that form the frame for the large, elegant tent.  A tall driftwood mirror rests to the side of the shop against a wall of pale grey material.  Three mannequins occupy the center of the room, their forms resting atop a soft, brightly patterned carpet."
