    "This sparsely decorated room is obviously designed with a martial theme.  Standing at the western archway of the hall are two sentinels guarding the entry, both clad in full plate armor with adornments and regalia representing Gosaena and Jastev.  The walls are lined with weapon racks which contain nearly every common type of weapon.  The floor itself is completely covered in padded, well-cured leather.  Four training mannequins are set in recessed alcoves in each corner of the room."
