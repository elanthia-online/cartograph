  "description": [
    "Thick patches of residue from pale golden sap make walking here a sticky proposition.  The walkway, suspended above the fetid mire below, wends both to the notheast and to the west with no end in sight in either direction.  Little moonlight reaches the ground through the dense foliage overhead, leaving the sturdy handrails as the only guide for travelers."
