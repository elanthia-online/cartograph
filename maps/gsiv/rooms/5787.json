  "description": [
    "The tunnel floor takes a sharp downturn as it winds northward and the roar of a waterfall makes any further movement in that direction unlikely.  By the hollow sound of its echo, the cataract is a precipitous drop.  Perhaps in the light of day such falls would be lovely, but the endless blackness ensures that none will ever admire its beauty."
