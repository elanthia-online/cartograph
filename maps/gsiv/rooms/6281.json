    "Darkness shrouds this tentacle of the hutch formed from iron shields fused into a great mass.  Dozens of little blood-shot eyes stare malignantly at you from the shadows, and the air is thick with the stench of disease and four-legged reproach.  Overcome with horror, your mind slips unbidden into thoughts of the chaotic passions and horrible terror that drive these villainous abominations."
