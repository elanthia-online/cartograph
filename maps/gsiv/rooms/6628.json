    "A large discolored area marks the north wall of this room, as if a large picture, or perhaps a mirror, had hung there for many years.  A tattered, broken down wing chair sits next to a small dilapidated table in one corner and an old poster bed occupies most of the east wall.  Like four bowing monks before a mattress altar, the bed sags from years of humidity and parasites."
