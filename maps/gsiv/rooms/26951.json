    "Cream-hued travertine walls, incredibly smooth and glass-like in appearance, are interrupted by an ironwood portal wrought in the shape of a ring that is partially imbedded in bright red brick cobblestones.  Protecting the entry from the elements is an umbrella-like awning fashioned of lacquered wooden slates, its ends dangling bright lanterns that have eahnor rooves.  A blown glass hummingbird feeder rests to the north of the path, its wrought iron supports hidden amid a wealth of showy camelia bushes."
