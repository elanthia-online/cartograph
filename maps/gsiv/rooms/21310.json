    "The main room of the house is large but cozy.  A pair of settees with matching footstools sit before a massive stone fireplace.  Along one wall, tall bookcases stand alternately with racks, each holding a goodly assortment of their proper objects.  Thickly woven tapestries cover the windows, enhancing the room's feelings of privacy and intimacy."
