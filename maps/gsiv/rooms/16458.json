    "[Misty Isle Exteriors, Alcove]"

  "description": [
    "This tiny alcove is small but well-kept.  The smooth walls have been coated with a robin's-egg blue paint in contrast to the round sea foam green rug that covers the entire floor of the area.  In the center of the room, a silver-caged parrot whistles loudly, sporadically cocking its head and ruffling its feathers to visitors."
