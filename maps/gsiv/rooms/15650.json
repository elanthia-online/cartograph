    "A red and blue quilt covers the thick mattress of an oversized feather bed that fills the far end of the room.  Tucked between the bed and the wall is a nightstand of whitewashed pine.  White linen hangings with blue embroidered edges decorate the windows, and a rag rug covers the smoothly sanded floor beams.  A loosely woven curtain separates this space from the outer room and a ladder ascends up to an opening in the ceiling."
