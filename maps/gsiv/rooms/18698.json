    "Open to the sky, the peaceful garden at the center of the lodge is filled with carefully pruned miniature glowbark trees and neatly trimmed grass.  Beds of crimson sirenflowers that rustle with every movement frame the doorways leading to various rooms.  Unlit glaes lanterns atop sturdy poles are set along the white gravel paths that lead to a thick meditation mat beside a rough boulder in the center.  A spring bubbles up from a rocky knoll in the northeast corner, flowing down to fill a small pool."
