    "The scents of freshly dug earth and ozone mingle unpleasantly in this cramped room.  The low ceiling is supported by roughly hewn planks supported by adze-cut posts, which also serve to brace the earthen walls.  The solid granite floors appear to be the natural bedrock, pierced by a staircase winding downward.  In stark contrast to the rough surroundings, a gleaming eahnor archway is set in one wall, flanked by a pair of stone panels."
