    "From the willow supports overhead, a myriad of vibrantly colored flowers have been hung out to dry, while the edge of this space is lined with narrow shelves full of glass jars containing various pigments.  The astringent scent of herbs and plants is pervasive here, and to the east, an arched passage leads further into the shop."
