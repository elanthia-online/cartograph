    "Lit by a single candle that rests atop each of several tables, the room is dim and faintly scented with sawdust and incense.  A plush gold rug covers the hardwood floor and muffles the sounds of footfalls.  Scattered atop the rug are a few soft burgundy sofas, each one paired with a carved linden end table.  Set in one oak-paneled wall, a carved pine arch leads out of the room, while on the other, ebon-framed paintings of the local flora and fauna are displayed at even intervals."
