    "The thick black walls of the tent are covered in an assortment of large mirrors, their reflective surfaces capturing the plethora of gem-decorated inventory around the shop, causing the entire room to glitter.  In one corner of the tent resides a mirror-finished counter where a tall amethyst-eyed human paces anxiously behind it."
