  "description": [
    "The ground rises steeply here, affording scenic vistas of the Mistydeep River to the east.  A gravel path, its surface carefully raked, curves between stately, widely spaced hardwoods.  To the west, a tranquil babble announces the presence of Avocet Creek, leaping downward through its boulder-strewn channel."
