    "A tree stand is situated just off the path here, providing comfortable temporary lodging for hunters who frequent these woods.  The broken tips of many arrows litter this area, and the trees nearby bear the dark bloodstains of many gutted game animals.  Empty, broken flasks litter a small ring of stones used to contain fires lit in the tree stand."
