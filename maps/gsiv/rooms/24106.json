    "Urns of various sizes take up all available space in this room.  Scarabs, spiders, and beetles of all sizes scurry in and out of the urns, creating a nearly constant drone of scuttling sounds.  The chipped and broken pieces of dislodged lids lay scattered across the stone floor, crunching under your feet with every step."
