    "The smell of baked goods and cinnamon pervades this small room.  Honey-hued wood-paneled walls with several red-curtained windows rise from the black and white tiled floor.  A large oak table sits in the middle of the room, while a wood stove burns in the corner.  Various baked goods, a clear glass candy jar and a spacious wicker basket rest on an antique white counter.  A whitewashed wooden door leads back outside, while a wicker door leads deeper into the cottage."
