    "The back section is a near mirror image of the front area except for the ebon canvas sheets that add a darker ambience to the room.  Pots filled with black sand surround both a large box and a splintered crate, and a wrought iron hutch has been secured to the metal bars.  A large glass aquarium with an open lid rests on the ground."
