    "A lonely cloud floats lazily above, the only flaw in an otherwise perfect sky.  A few sparrows take advantage of the pleasant weather, flittering from one rooftop to another, the small birds searching for the perfect perch.  Never tiring of their chase, the aerial dance continues for quite some time."
