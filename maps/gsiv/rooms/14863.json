    "The path winds through a shadowy growth of aspen trees.  Breezes stir the silvery leaves into a quiet murmur and give them the look of flickering silver in the moonlight.  Underfoot, thick mosses carpet the trail, muffling even the heaviest footfall, and the voices of night birds and crickets fill the night's shadows.",
    "The path winds through a growth of aspen trees.  Their fine leaves flutter at the touch of a breeze, giving them the look of flickering silver.  Underfoot, tiny blue flowers, their blossoms both diminutive and exquisite, sprinkle the thick mosses carpeting the trail.  A host of birds inhabit the elegant trees, their voices a constant conversation within the silvery boughs."
