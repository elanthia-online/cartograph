    "Rainbow-whorled windows, foggy with condensation created by the heat of a nearby fireplace, rise from the floor to the ceiling upon two of the lounge's four walls.  Tall golden linden bookcases frame passageways that lead out of the area, and a soft carpet of indigo and cobalt blue stretches across the floor."
