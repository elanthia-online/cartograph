    "With very little warning, the path veers away from the riverbank just as the edge of a short cliff comes into view.  The nearby water tumbles neatly over the edge, though the path instead banks downward in a steep slope before it also seems to fall off over the edge.  A thick grip of vines rooted squarely and firmly around the base of several giant, gnarled trees spills over the edge of the cliff, just where the path itself ends."
