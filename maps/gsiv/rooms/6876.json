  "description": [
    "A small window set high in the wall provides dim light to this slightly musty cellar.  A few boxes and pieces of unused kitchen equipment lean in the corner nearest the trapdoor, likely placed for easiest access by the kitchen staff.  A few wispy cobwebs decorate the ceiling, looking recently spun by spiders made homeless in a good sweeping.  A door opens in the south wall, giving a glimpse of racks beyond it."
