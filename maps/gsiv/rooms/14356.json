    "Shifting in hue, the banisters along this section of the stairway transition from a dark natural hue to a bleached appearance, even though the wood is the same.  The archaic runes that decorate other sections seem brighter here beneath the glow of strange orbs caged in black wrought iron.  A copper tiled overhang guards the landing from the elements."
