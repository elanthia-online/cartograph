    "A large boulder constricts the tunnel, making it necessary to edge past the outcropping single file, taking care to avoid sharp extrusions of rock in the wall opposite it.  Once embraced in the narrow crevice, it is possible to see a striking series of carvings on the stone's surface.  They depict groups of giants in a primitive style that is nonetheless evocative and beautiful in its simplicity."
