    "Ivory silk sheets are connected from the ceiling to the floor throughout the chambers.  An alternating colored, glass-paned window is suspended directly over the center splaying colored light in all directions.  In place of a floor is a collection of oddly shaped pillows, each of a different fabric and color."
