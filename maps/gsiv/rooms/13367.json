    "Looking more like a floating island, the Celebration Barge sports an expanse of pristinely groomed lawn from gunnel to gunnel.  Benefitting from the attentions of skilled Sylvans and Imaeran adepts, the barge's flagstone walkway is bordered by an assortment of exotic flowers, and a sizable willow forms a domed pavilion of willow leaves in the bow.  Rising above the center of the barge and aglow from the chandeliers within, the immense crystal dome of the Celebration Hall sparkles above its gold and white walls.",
