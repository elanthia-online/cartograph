    "A pair of streets meet the Bazaar here in a sprawling confluence of worn cobble.  Crowds of people bustle in and out, some pausing to mill amongst friends and neighbors, others hustling busily on their ways.  Several stone figurines stand at the fringe, watching the drama of town life as it whooshes by."
