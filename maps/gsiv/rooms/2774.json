    "The lodge casts reflections across the drifts from candles in its many windows, lit against the gloom of the blowing wind and snow.  Boulders mark a path which turns and twists, following the foundation of the lodge then leading away into the forest of pines to the northwest.  A curious building stands against the north wall of the inn, its walls and ceiling fashioned of glass."
