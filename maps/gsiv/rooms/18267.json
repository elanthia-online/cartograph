    "Moonlight barely illuminates the murky depths of a vast lagoon stretching out before the tumble of water rushing down from the plateaus above.  The nocturnal melody of the jungle serves as a striking companion to the surprisingly quiet sound of the bi-level falls cascading from the lowest outcropping to feed the pool.  Deep shadows help to almost completely conceal the presence of a cave hidden behind the ripple of the liquid curtain."
