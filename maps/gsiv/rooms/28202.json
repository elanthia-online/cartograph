    "The only light in this room enters through the open door from the hallway outside, casting long shadows through the still, stale air.  The outline of a high-backed, stately throne sits in silence before an empty audience, against the backdrop of multiple banners along the wall that unfurl to the floor, and bear the standards of the Sapphire Guard.  Despite the preserved nature of the room's contents, no dust rests on any visible surface."
