    "\"Ahoy t' deck!\" comes a call from the rigging high above where a crow's nest can be seen perched among the yards of the mainmast.  The breeze blowing in from the open sea carries off the rest of the garbled message.  A group of thickly muscled sailors works intently, polishing railing and checking tack for wear.  One, a particularly robust halfling, oversees their efforts, barking orders in her loud, raspy voice."
