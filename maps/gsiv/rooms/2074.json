    "As you wander through the ruins of what was once a thriving village, you are suddenly stricken by the overpowering silence.  There are no crickets singing, no squirrels chittering, not even any mice scurrying into the darkness.  Even though enough time has passed since the fire to allow vines and small bushes to choke the paths between the burned out buildings, all other life appears to have vanished without a trace.",
