    "Small and tidy, this four-square room is furnished with only a few hard-back chairs gathered in a rough semi-circle.  In one corner are the remains of a few shattered music stands that appear to have been used in a brawl.  Panels of thick rolton wool cover the ceiling, though whether to keep sound in or out is anyone's guess."
