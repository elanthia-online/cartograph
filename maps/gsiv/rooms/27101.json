    "The occasional bloom floats along on the constantly lapping current of the lagoon, swept into the cove by the waterfall's motions.  The depths of the water are so extensive that it is impossible to touch the lagoon bed, and the liquid becomes so dark of a blue further down that it cannot be seen either.  Only the random flash of silver scales as a fish darts breaks the shadows."
