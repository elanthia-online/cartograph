    "A cloying fog laced with deep indigo tendrils hovers over the rough terrain.  Jagged, lichen-covered boulders block descent to the sea below but create a sufficient breaker for unrelenting waves that threaten to overwhelm the surrounding land.  A crystal clear pool has formed in the shadow of towering rock, and underfoot, slurping sounds of fleshy muck is suggestive that one should not linger."
