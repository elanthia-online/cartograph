    "An Arkati pantheon painting hangs on one of the white brocade walls, and an elegantly arched fel ceiling rises overhead.  A large potted fern sits in one corner of a sanded pine floor.  There is a large cherrywood cabinet on one side of the shop and an elegantly carved oak armoire on the other."
