  "description": [
    "A beaten animal track parallels the edge of a huge granite boulder, moving north, then circling around to the east.  Further north, the ridge of the city wall, having more the appearance of a natural hill covered in vegetation, makes a futile stand against the persistent encroachment of the surrounding forest."
