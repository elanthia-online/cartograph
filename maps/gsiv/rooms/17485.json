  "description": [
    "The center of the dark-stained parquet floor is covered with a white polar bear rug.  Every so often soft chimes emit overhead from a heavy crystal chandelier as it twirls gently from the chains securing it to the ceiling.  Scattered around the room to provide some privacy are some tables adorned with lacy, antique white tablecloths.  At the back of the room, an overburdened serving cart with several empty mugs and dirty dishes partially blocks the doorway to the kitchen."
