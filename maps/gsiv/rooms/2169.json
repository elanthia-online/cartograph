    "A pile of boulders, detritus of a rock-slide or eruption, halts the trail in a narrow bottle-neck.  Immense wasp nests dot the higher rocks like bulbous blemishes.  Swarms of venomous insects circle many of them, erratic pinpoints that produce an ominous, underlying hum.  A few nests on lower rocks show evidence of vandalism, their interiors gutted and spouting filmy material that waves in the gusts of hot wind."
