    "Delicate tendrils of light fade into shadows as they reach for the dark corners of this room.  A large, perfectly square ebonwood table is surrounded by a set of long benches covered in soft grey velvet.  A low glass display counter runs the length of one wall, and above the counter is a vaalin-framed sign."
