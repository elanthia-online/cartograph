    "The trail becomes a bit softer, and the footing is unsure.  The ground isn't any wetter, but small, raised cracks in a serpentine fashion crisscross the trail, signs of mole or gopher activity.  Fox paw prints are evident in the dirt, and perhaps the foxes come to feed upon the burrowers when they emerge.  The forest is still, with only a small background humming caused by flies and other winged insects flitting about in search of sustenance."
