    "Circling along the wagons parked to the north and west, the walkway continues around the outer edge of the carnival grounds.  Piles of debris lashed together with nets fill the gaps between the wagons.  Excited chatter from carnival goers fills the air.  Footprints circle a moist patch in the walkway."
