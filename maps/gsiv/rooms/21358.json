  "description": [
    "A large window framed by delicately veined morning glory leaves floods the room with light and fresh air.  The walls are covered with carefully cultivated morning glories of delicate violet shades.  A large bed covered with a puma hide blanket beckons from behind a thin ora screen in one corner, and an instrument rack holding a lute and a harp stands against the wall next to a large bookcase."
