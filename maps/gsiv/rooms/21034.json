    "Tendrils of silvery mist hover above the small stream that winds through this part of the jungle.  Like the tentacles of an octopus, the mist crawls along the ground, wrapping itself around the vine-covered trunks of the nearby trees.  Gigantic ferns uncoil their fronds, rivaling the size of the trees above them.  A large tree branch lies across the water, allowing dry passage to the northwest, while a natural rock bridge leads to the northeast."
