    "The huge, columned room functions as the meeting room of Willow Hall.  Linden, haon and modwir squares form the floor, skillfully laid so the multi-hued woods blend together.  The walls are richly carved with woodland scenes, and the columns are tree trunks left untouched.  Rows of benches face a raised dais with a podium and a few chairs.  Through a fieldstone arch flanked by two stained-glass windows, one can glimpse a moonlit garden.",
