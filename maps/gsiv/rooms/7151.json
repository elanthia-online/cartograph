    "The wall opposite the door is covered with moss and oozing water.  If you listen, you hear a steady trickling sound.  A slimy stream crosses the floor to its center and vanishes into an iron grate.  Light from a small pot set high on a wall sparkles off the water droplets clinging to the moss."
