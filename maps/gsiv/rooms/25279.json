  "description": [
    "This well lit room appears quite cozy, giving the impression of being well lived in despite its orderly cleanliness.  A large, comfortable bed takes up the left wall while the right is dominated by a desk sitting beneath an elaborate painting.  A soft murmur of falling water flows through the room, although no source is immediately visible."
