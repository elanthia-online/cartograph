    "Smooth granite walls rise from a speckled black marble floor.  Just above an open-mawed greater vruul statue hangs a tattered merchant permit, and an uneven wooden ceiling completes the picture.  A gold-leafed mistwood cabinet and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
