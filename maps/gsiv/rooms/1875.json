  "description": [
    "Abandoned homes huddle against the cliff face.  Their windows and doors are boarded up, but many have gaping holes in the walls.  Few people wander by. The quiet is broken only by a distant string of rants and curses, which echo off the canyon walls.  One old dwarf, clad in soiled rags, sleeps in the street."
