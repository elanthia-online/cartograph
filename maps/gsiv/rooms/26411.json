    "A natural coating of rubbed teak oil leaves the decking planks gleaming in the moonlight, while encompassing brass railings have been polished to the point where one can see their own reflection at a glance.  The softer summer rings striating the teak planks have been worn ever so slightly, giving a natural no-slip purchase underfoot.  Though no deck chairs are present, there remains ample standing room along the railings, gifting an unfettered view of the moonlit waters below.",
