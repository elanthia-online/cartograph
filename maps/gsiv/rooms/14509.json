  "description": [
    "A granite observation ledge overlooks a wild, wooded environment, offering visitors a spectacular view of several canines.  Running through the center of the habitat is a tall barrier, neatly disguised as a row of thick trees interspersed with heavy overgrowth.  On one side, wolves curiously people watch, while on the other side, dholes wander about their business."
