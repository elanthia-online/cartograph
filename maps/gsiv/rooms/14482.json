    "Water-smoothed pebbles of all colors are jumbled together to form a path that winds around the glaes dome that encloses the aviaries.  Several tiny footbridges arch over the bends of a stream that meanders back and forth alongside the path.  Lush grass and several plantings of green bamboo add to the peaceful atmosphere created by the slow moving water.",

Several tiny footbridges arch over the bends of a stream that meanders back and forth alongside the path.  Filigreed iron lanterns suspended from tall posts reflect gold glimmers off the water, adding to the peaceful atmosphere."
