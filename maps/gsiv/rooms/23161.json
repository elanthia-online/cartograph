  "description": [
    "Tome-filled shelves cover the wagon's front wall, most of them within arm's length of a generously sized reach-through beneath the driver's bench.  The wagon's left wall is taken up with a row of hanging enchanter's robes, their hues ranging through the spectrum, and their folds embroidered with arcane symbols.  Almost hidden behind them, a canvas cot hangs, folded against the wall, and a similarly built worktable hangs from the wagon's right wall, its lacquered surface barren except for a rolaren-bound illthorn hourglass."
