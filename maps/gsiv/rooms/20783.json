    "Tracery windows of rose-tinted crystal form the backdrop of the chapel's simple stone and pine altar.  Recessed niches along the walls hold vases of flowers and other offerings left by pilgrims who have long since continued on their way.  A woven burgundy rug traverses the stone floor from the oak door to the altar, leading visitors through the small shrine."
