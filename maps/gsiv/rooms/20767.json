  "description": [
    "White driftwood walls climb to a generous height, surrounding this semi-circular room.  Several open porthole windows offer a view of the area below, and allow faint breezes into the hall.   In the center of the room, a long darkly stained table is surrounded by padded wooden chairs.  Several sphere-shaped, green paper lanterns dangle from the ceiling, their light casting a variety of verdant shadows on the floor.  An ascending spiral steps resides near the back wall, and a narrow staircase leads down.  A curved pale blue doorway offers entrance to the next room."
