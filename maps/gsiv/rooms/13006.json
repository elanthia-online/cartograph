    "Mismatched slabs of stone and marble make up the walls of this small, windowless shop.  The creaky pine floorboards have been covered with a worn goat hide rug, while an array of gold and copper banners hang from the ceiling.  In the back of the room a display of fine-crafted ayrs sits along the wall."
