  "description": [
    "A bower of trees looms high overhead, the verdant canopy contrasting sharply with the pale alabaster columns that reach up into their leafy depths.  Carved stone benches rest in between the circle of pillars and are all angled to provide an ample view of the fountain that dominates this courtyard.  At one end of the court sits a large marble building, its wide porch and ornamental carvings standing out in stark relief from the lush backdrop."
