    "The thin turf has been torn from the ground in places, unable to resist the persistent nibbling of the herds.  Scattered shapes can be seen up the hillsides to both sides of the small creek, randomly making their way across the field.  A small ring of stones has been left by an unknown traveller, circling a charred fire pit.  A gently eddying breeze blows over the fire, tossing up small puffs of ashes."
