    "Surprisingly clean and dry, this room has a utilitarian look, with obsidian counters and stone floors and walls.  The counters are piled high with dusty books and scrolls, spell ingredients, herbs, and sealed bottles and jars with liquids of varied colors and viscosity and dried creatures in them.  A big black cauldron effervesces gently in the center of the room, but there is no apparent source of heat under it."
