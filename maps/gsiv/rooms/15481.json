    "The low murmer of conversation fills the air as members sit and chat at the comfortable tables, or quietly drink chilled tankards of rum.  Various pieces of armor and exotic weaponry sit in display cases scattered about the room, trophies from historic battles as well as souvenirs from individual feats of valour."
