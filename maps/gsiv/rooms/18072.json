    "Hardly more than an alcove off the supply room, this cramped space is dominated by a wide plank table at its center.  Affixed to the wall behind the table is an oak shelf lined with myriad bottles and jars.  An acrid mix of smells hangs heavily in the still air, filtering down from the herbs and various dismembered body parts drying on hooks overhead."
