    "This austere room is amazingly clean.  Not a speck of dust appears anywhere in it.  In fact, the only items in the room are securely bolted, tacked or nailed down.  An iron table and a large chest in the far corner both lean toward the center of the room, and what is left of the crimson carpet appears to have been shredded in the same direction, revealing the marble floor underneath.  Light filters in from a few holes in the black marble walls to glint off a twisted metal sign."
