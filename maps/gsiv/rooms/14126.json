    "Striking viridian trefoil splays spiny white flower-heads that loll from bowed stems.  Trampled umbrage defines a northerly pathway that winds crookedly through myriad downcast branches.  Antiquated faewood roots have curled and pulled upward from the surface of the earth, looping together in tangled knots."
