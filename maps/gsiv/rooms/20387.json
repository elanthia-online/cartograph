    "A pair of freestanding ebonwood shelves take up most of the room in this area, placed opposite from one another and piled with garments.  Several mismatched electrum lanterns are strung from chains above both, all cradling flickering amethyst candles.  Pushed between one shelf and the velvet drapery wall is a single oak crate with the lid half wedged off."
