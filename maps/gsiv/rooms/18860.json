  "description": [
    "The pool is deep enough here to cover the shoulders of a halfling.  Enclosed on all sides by stone, the damp wall shimmers from the light of dozens of candles sitting on outcroppings of varying heights.  An effusive glow comes from the water, further lending to the gentle ambiance of the grotto.  Ledges line the edge of the pool, offering a convenient place to kick back and relax."
