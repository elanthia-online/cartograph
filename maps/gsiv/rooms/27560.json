  "description": [
    "Bright torches, housed in wrought iron cages, decorate the rough walls of the cavern, their flickering light illuminating a rough painted oak sign that hangs above a large colorful gaming board.  A rough clapboard counter bars guests from getting too close to the playing space and also holds a row of darts, which are watched over by a lanky human boy.  Surrounded by broken balloon bits and empty candy wrappers, a deep sand-filled crag occasionally gurgles or whistles as the mists roll through the space."
