    "Three of the four stone walls hold blasted-out niches that serve as bookcases in this vast chamber.  Housed upon the stone shelves are thousands upon thousands of huge leather-bound books.  On the highest shelves, the arcane volumes are covered with a thick layer of dust and cobwebs, as if they had rested undisturbed since days of old.  A dozen or so tables have been placed in a symmetrical pattern throughout the room, surrounded by high-backed leather chairs."
