    "Despair and desolation hang heavy in the air over the small plain before you.  Off in the distance, near the coast, what was once a small city lies smouldering in ruins.  The thick, black smoke from the razed hamlet lies heavy near the building tops, as if the weight of the carnage held it fast.  A huge stack of bodies is piled near the western gate, some of which almost look familiar."
