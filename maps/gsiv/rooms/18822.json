  "description": [
    "Wavelets from the river lap incessantly against the pebbly beach created by an outwash of a small creek flowing in from the heart of the island.  A pair of large pine trees frame the beach, their ancient roots clinging to the eroding soil like gnarled fingers.  The creek-bed wends its way to the river through a dense thicket of reeds to the southwest."
