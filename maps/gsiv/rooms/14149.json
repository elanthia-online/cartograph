    "It does not seem as if you could climb any higher, yet the hall continues.  Strangely the frescos seem to have been left unfinished.  There is the outline of a great army just sketched into the fresh plaster here, but no hint of the tools or craftsmen that are working on them.  Certainly this can not be all there is to this masterpiece."
