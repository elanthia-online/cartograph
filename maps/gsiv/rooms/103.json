    "Almost any movement sends dirt and pebbles tumbling down the vertiginous slope, and one section has already been torn away by a recent rockslide.  Digging into the loose gravel, next to a pale green lichen-covered boulder, is a hairy-legged beetle.  A hopefully stable protrusion is visible just below the trail."
