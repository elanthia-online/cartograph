    "A tall grey boulder stands to the south, blocking passage in the direction.  The bulk of its mass extends to the west, while the trail skirts around it to the southeast.  Fat white grubs as large as a giantman's finger feed along the edge of the boulder, underneath its sheltering side in the thick rich loam of decomposing grasses.  Their bodies ooze and pulsate as they move along in search of more digestible matter."
