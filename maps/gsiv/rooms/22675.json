  "description": [
    "Numerous sections of hammered glaes, invar, vultite, and steel form concave walls, blending in a chaotic display of dwarven craftsmanship.  A grim, soot-covered dwarf works his hammer hurriedly along a slab of glowing orange metal, frequently changing its position on a massive anvil that resides in the center of the chamber.  Another dwarf beyond him works with a grinder and polisher, a blackened vise mounted on the wall to one side and finished hilts piled high in a bin to the other."
