    "Rivers of watered silk cascade over the walls in lavish tapestries.  Long-forgotten tales of history and lore unravel throughout the beautiful hangings, in delicate weavings of fine gold thread.  Relics bejeweled with blue sapphires and lapis are set in front of the tapestries, as homage to those woven into the draping silks.  Lancing across the halls, dazzling glares of light are reflected and guided by a cleverly positioned mirror on the western wall."
