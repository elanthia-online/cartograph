  "description": [
    "The tunnel ends, widening out just a little and forming a circle.  Depictions of urban dwellings reside on the northeast, southeast and southwest walls.  A steel grey townhouse occupies the northeast wall.  The window boxes with their brightly colored mushrooms look almost real.  On the southeast wall, the flat wooden slats of a blue row house frame long vertical windows.  Strangely, the back of a home fills the southwest wall."
