  "description": [
    "Weeds, bushes, saplings and even larger trees have disrupted the cobblestone road severely, making it impossible to walk the road.  Instead one must circumvent the obstacles but still continue in the general direction.  Most of the cobblestones are still evident, although overturned and moved well out of position, and the forest bed is not choked with underbrush, so the road is still fairly easy to follow.  It would be much easier to travel if someone had maintained the road, though."
