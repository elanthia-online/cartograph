    "This room is very dark.  A three-legged stool is topped with a cluster of guttering candles, providing the only source of uneven light.  In the middle of the room next to the stool is a large modwir trunk with tarnished brass clasps.  Cobwebs dangle from the ceiling, and large shadows flicker in the corners."
