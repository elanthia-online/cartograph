  "description": [
    "Roughly carved out of dirt, the terminus is surrounded on four sides by walls and has a small tunnel that leads towards a central nexus.  Spidery white roots decorate the smooth walls and the floor is pitted with oddly shaped rocks.  Four thick support posts mark the corners of the area, while a blackened iron ladder rises towards the knotty oak ceiling where a small trap door stands closed.  A waxed parchment is tacked near the ladder."
