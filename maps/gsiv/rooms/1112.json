    "A fallen branch has blocked the stream, causing it to spread out and create a small slough.  Several types of insects forage in the murky waters, and bullfrogs croak from the nearby tall grasses.  The slough is still enough to breed annoying mosquitoes that buzz about looking for a good source of blood.  To the west the trail moves into a large copse of maple and elm trees, while to the southeast it spills out into a flat, treeless plain just before the basalt plateau."
