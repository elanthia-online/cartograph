    "Concentric rings of benches funnel down to a large, circular area.  Two rows of low-backed chairs ring the central expanse in which three cushioned stools are set in a row before a long, low writing-desk.  A small lectern faces the stools, providing speakers a place to address gathered lords and guild members."
