    "An immense barbican stands sentry over the wide South Gate of Icemule Trace, and the eastern tower stands high over this portion of the wall.  A small window provides the only means of entry, but it is far too high to access without some help from above.  To the north, the wall looks over Barter Alley to Tartifact's Bakery and the other shops of Trader's Way."
