  "description": [
    "More a large alcove than a room, this nook is lined on two walls with shelves reaching from the floor to the ceiling.  On the north wall, a large window and window seat, complete with soft cushions and pillows, invite you to sit and browse the collection of old favorites lining the shelves.  One shelf holds a collection of the Elanthia Herald, some brittle with age, but all obviously read often.  A lap robe sits folded on the seat, ready to warm those who sit here on a cold winter day."
