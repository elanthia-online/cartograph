    "Built into the sloping roof space, the galleried loft is naturally illuminated by open-shuttered windows set between narrow oak rafters.  Each pane offers an unimpeded view of the freeport and beyond with the use of an imflass telescope.  Brick walls on either side are filled with astral maps and cluttered shelves.  Clear of furniture, a deep blue woolen rug covering the floor provides a suitable blank canvas for four metal lanterns suspended overhead."
