    "Bookshelves stacked with ledgers, books and other records line the walls of this modest office.  A quill pen lies on a small table in the corner next to a jar of ink, ready to make last minute corrections and notes before the papers are stored.  Under the table squats a heavy safe, locked tightly against unwanted intrusion.  A small bookstand is tucked into one corner of the room."
