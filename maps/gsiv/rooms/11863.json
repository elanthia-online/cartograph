  "description": [
    "The statue of a slender Elven woman rests near the eastern side of the wall.  She stands with feet slightly spread, hands raised, and eyes gazing off across the field toward some distant point on the horizon.  One arm is drawn back toward her shoulder as if pulling on the string of a bow, but her hands are empty and her once gracefully fashioned fingers are chipped and broken."
