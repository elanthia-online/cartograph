    "A group of black candles sits atop the dark ebonwood table, their flames illuminating the cramped space and unadorned walls.  A rendition of clouds gathering across a roiling sea is painted along the arcing, low ceiling in dark shades.  An iron porthole is inset upon the nearest wall, the edges of its thick glass flecked with bits of grime that break the sunlight streaming through into fractured beams.  The table is devoid of any decoration save for a small drawing in the middle of its surface.",
