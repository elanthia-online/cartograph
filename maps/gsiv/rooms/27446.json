    "The river widens into a pool, marking the southern boundary of the glade.  Children play in the water, dunking one another gleefully.  Occasionally one will climb a large oak tree on the riverbank, swing out over the water by a rope tied to one of its limbs, and then let go to fall into the pool with a splash."
