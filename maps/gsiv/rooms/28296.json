    "Several brown leather club chairs are grouped around the room with small tables placed nearby.  A framed mirror hangs on the wall opposite a solid oak door.  The floor is covered with a dark yellow textured rug, and bookcases reach half way up the walls.  A pale yellow enamelled stove stands in the corner."
