  "description": [
    "The ground slopes downward toward the northeast as the trail descends to river level.  To the southwest the trail winds through the Khohallatain Forest, hugging the bluff edge.  The river is forced into narrower confines as it flows downstream from this point.  It rushes past swiftly, boiling with rapids and whitecaps, carrying debris into troughs and then flinging it high into the air as the water roils and churns over boulders and rocks."
