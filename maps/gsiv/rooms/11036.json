    "Barely more than a crawlway, this claustrophobic passage continues parallel to the twisting creek.  Traveling quickly over smooth stones, the waterway serves as both companion and guide.  Tiny blindfish traverse the length of the creekbed, blissfully unaware of the nearby foot traffic.  Small oil-soaked rag torches stuck into the walls help illuminate the path."
