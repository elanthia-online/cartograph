    "The air inside the hut is a stagnant, unbreathable stench formed by the presence of sweat, blood, death, and feces.  Light cut through cracks in the walls, illuminating little, serving as a cruel reminder of a world those prisoners within once belonged to.  What floor is visible is soiled and serves as at least one source of the rancid air and is composed of parts and pieces of former prisoners ground into the soil by more recent victims of the Grimswarm."
