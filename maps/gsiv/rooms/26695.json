    "The near-frozen abyss spreads out endlessly past the black sandbar.  Shafts of light from above, barely visible skirting the tops of this depth, cannot penetrate the congealed, watery depths at this level.  A faintly luminescent bloated dead sawfish floats belly-up in the water surrounded by small fish delicately pecking away at its carcass."
