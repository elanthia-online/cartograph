    "You must step carefully in this room.  Unfinished (yet rather sharp) sword blades poke out of the ice at your feet, threatening to shorten you by a foot.  They seem to have come from the remains of a shop smashed by the ice, the pieces of a sign in the shape of a sword indicating that this was once the armory."
