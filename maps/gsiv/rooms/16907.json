    "Metal bins stacked in uneven piles threaten to topple over onto the flagstone floor.  The curling labels affixed to each bin indicate some form of organization, but the torn and crumpled papers inside do not inspire confidence.  Three of the larger bins have been pushed together and topped with a plank of wood to create a sort of desk."
