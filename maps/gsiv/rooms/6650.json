    "Plush black carpet covers the floor here beneath an array of heavy embroidered tapestries that line the walls.  A dozen carved modwir chairs surround a huge table crafted of the same dark wood, and a single large chair of fine maoral stands at the head.  Along one wall, a silver serving table stands beside a polished maoral bar, and a stone basin rests in a corner of the room, barely visible in the flickering light of the elaborate crimson vaalin chandelier above you."
