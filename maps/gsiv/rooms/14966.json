    "Bookcases, reaching almost to the ceiling, line one entire wall of this room.  On the opposite side a reading chair and small table sit by a large picture window that looks out on a small grassy clearing among the trees.  You look down and see a scattered trail of tart crumbs that seems to lead from the chair to the bookcases and back again."
