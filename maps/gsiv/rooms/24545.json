    "Relief is nowhere to be found as sharp spikes continue to thrust outward from the spiny bushes.  The ancient snow carpeting the ground here is anything but serene, it's color yellow from age.  A rotted canvas sack is stuck within the thorns, the slight breeze unable to free it from its prison."
