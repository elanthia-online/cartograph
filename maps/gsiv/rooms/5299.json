    "The trees overhead, combined with the hillock to the southwest, almost completely block all light from ever reaching the ground.  The smell of must is pervasive, perpetuated by large toadstools spreading over the rich black earth.  A diagonal line of thick underbrush and overgrown bushes grows to the east, perhaps marking the run of an underground river."
