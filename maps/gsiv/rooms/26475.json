  "description": [
    "The rocky landscape slopes downward into the belly of some high-appointed sea caves deeply eroded into the precipitous mountainside.  Pale salt striations paint tenuous, wavy designs upon the back walls, tattooed by fluctuating water levels through the ages.  An impressive view of the far-reaching blue-black ocean unravels before the eyes, winding its way free from the low-hanging trenches of dense silver fog."
