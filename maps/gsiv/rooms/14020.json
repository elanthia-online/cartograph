    "Cream linen cushions striped in hues of terra cotta and sky-blue cover the benches that line the walls, save for a small doorway leading back into the garden.  The open sides of the gazebo are draped with sheer gossamer netting, through which the shadows of eager moths are visible.  A faceted crystal lamp hangs from a silver chain, the lit pillar candle within casting a warm glow over the area.  Centrally placed, a low white table painted with vines and flowers bears refreshments.",

The open sides of the gazebo are draped with sheer gossamer netting, allowing sunlight in and keeping the bees out.  From a conical white ceiling, a faceted crystal lamp is suspended from a silver chain.  Centrally placed, a low white table painted with vines and flowers bears refreshments."
