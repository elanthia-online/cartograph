    "The ice-encrusted west wall towers over the small, squat buildings that line Brewer's Alley.  The wall does little to prevent the icy winds from freezing the occasional passersby, as they meander among the shops and kiosks.",
    "The ice-encrusted west wall towers over the small, squat buildings that line Brewer's Alley.  From the look on the faces of the infrequent passersby, the granite bulwark offers little comfort from the icy winds that course through the shadowed shops and kiosks."
