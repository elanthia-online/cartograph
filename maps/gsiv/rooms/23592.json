    "Ragged cracks bisect the forward section of the bulwark where an enormous sea-facing harpoon is lodged in the wood.  Cracked belaying pins lie scattered about the deck, some broken into white and black splinters.  The aft section of the bulwark appears unscarred, though slightly blackened where it presses closest to the ballista."
