    "Rounding a large garden, the lane passes through a promenade of columns, athletic statuary posed on each pillar.  The silent figures stand in attitudes of action, as if frozen during some long-ago event.  Just inside the perimeter of marble guards, hedges have been trimmed into tall, thin fingers of green, their forms as elegant as the sculpture they escort."
