  "description": [
    "Splattered dyes decorate the brick wall at the back of this stall, their dark hues forming an irregular drip mark that pools where the wall and granite cobblestones meet.  An oak-handled cotton mop, riddled with colored dyes, rests in the back corner opposite a tidy shelf painted a bright grass green.  At the center of the stall, a low stool stands beside a tin tub amongst a scattering of empty wooden buckets."
