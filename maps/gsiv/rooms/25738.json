    "A substantial circular wall of rounded river rocks joined by smooth grey mortar provides privacy around this spacious bath.  No roof or overhead covering has been added however, leaving an open air feel and a view of the starry night sky.  A sunken tub, lined in smooth glass tiles of green and blue hues, commands the central location and provides occupants an unobstructed view while gazing upward from its depths."
