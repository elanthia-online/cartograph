    "A covered walkway paved with dark blue slate is brightly lit by an eahnor oil lamp crafted in the shape of a crescent moon.  A row of tall, grey marble pillars separates the walkway from the skylit atrium beyond.  An elaborately detailed scene has been carved into a black marble frieze that decorates the dark greystone wall."
