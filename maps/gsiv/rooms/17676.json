    "The haphazard depository of goods and items continues in this westard chamber with a number of crates and boxes.  On top of one stack is an open straw-packed crate offering the curious a glimpse inside.  On the floor, well away from other items, is a single scorched box.  Across the room, above a dark stain on the cavern floor, a rotting severed hand hangs from a piece of string tied to a spike hammered into the wall next to words scratched into the stone surface."
