    "Planked seating take up much of the space here.  Two holes have been cut out of the top of the planks, the surrounding area well-polished by long usage.  A metal bucket filled with a mixture of lime powder and ashes stands in a corner.  A white-washed haon door, with a painted slate hanging on it, leads outside."
