  "description": [
    "A large dead tree lies upon its side, its rotting branches, leaves and moss litter the forest floor.  Painted and carved into the smooth trunk are letters, symbols and shapes of all sizes.  A small sapling that had struggled to grow from under the dead tree lies trampled in the rotting leaves."
