    "A decorative linden branch wreath hangs on one of the gold-veined marble walls, and a low skylight-set ceiling rises overhead.  A grey-veined white marble fountain sits in one corner of a gold-speckled marble floor.  There is an elegantly carved oak armoire on one side of the shop and a gold-veined black marble counter on the other."
