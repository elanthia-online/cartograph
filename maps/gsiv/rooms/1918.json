    "A wooden wagon with a smashed right wheel sits askew along the side of the roadway.  Its contents, extremely rich soil, have been left there by the wagonmaster who walked off with his draft animals in a huff.  Judging from the footprints and shovel marks in the heap, local gardeners and children have made off with some of the haul."
