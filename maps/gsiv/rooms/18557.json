    "A wide dusty path makes its way along the edge of a field full of artichoke plants, and a smaller, narrow trail leads off from the main path into the field itself.  Emitting the light aroma common to most vegetation in spring air, the artichokes appear dull under the pale moonlight.  To the southwest, across a meadow embraced by shadows, the glow from several buildings lights up the otherwise dark sky.",
    "A wide dusty path makes its way along the edge of a field full of artichoke plants, and a smaller, narrow trail leads off from the main path into the field itself.  Emitting the light aroma common to most vegetation in spring air, the artichokes nearly gleam with their green color in the bright sunlight.  To the southwest, across a meadow, several buildings are just barely visible."
