  "description": [
    "The flapping wings of bats accompanied by their cries, a high-pitched metallic ping, fill the night air.  Mid-sized knolls rise up from the low-lying, sodden ground.  While hopping from one to another makes travel decidedly slower, they do offer some relief from treading through the muddy soil.  The tangle of tree roots, shrubs and plants provide the perfect home for a variety of birds and animals.",

The tangle of tree roots, shrubs and plants provide the perfect home for a variety of birds and animals.  A dark cloud of mosquitoes hovers just above the surface of a huge, sprawling, shapeless body of water.  Their dull humming chant becoming audible as they quickly approach land."
