    "The trees are well spaced and travel through the forest is relatively easy.  Small ferns and ivy occupy the areas beneath the trees that receive little light, while smaller versions of the maples, elms, birches and other deciduous trees compete for dominance in the better lit spots.  A thick carpet of dried leaves crunches underfoot, but the trail is well marked, the leaves flattened down by the passage of other travelers."
