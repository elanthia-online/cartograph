    "The chamber is decorated with rugs in shades of deep red and purple, and accessories of silver are spread on the modwir desk against the south wall.  In the far corner is a large feather mattress covered with burgundy spidersilk sheets and pillows.  Beside the bed is a small glaes altar, the heady aromas of jasmine and sandalwood wafting up from the scorched silver bowl upon it.  Covering the ceiling is a shattered mirror, the soft glow behind it illuminating the room in colorful fragmented spectrums."
