    "With walls rising sharply out of the ground, a natural bridge appears to the southwest.  The walls themselves are curved, giving the impression it may have been a lava tube at one time, but the top has collapsed, leaving it open to the weather.  The path to the northeast moves quickly into the waiting forest."
