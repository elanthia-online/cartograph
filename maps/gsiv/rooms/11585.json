    "The ceiling of this small, low-beamed berth is nothing more than a hatch covering a piece of iron grating.  Three canvas hammocks slung fore-and-aft hang aslant, the lowermost besmirched by a malodorous dark stain in the center.  Sea chests and ship's duffles lie cluttered against the bulkhead."
