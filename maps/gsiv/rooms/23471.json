  "description": [
    "Short candles in glass jars are scattered around the walls in carved nooks.  The flickering light casts long shadows across the dusty floor, throwing the objects resting on a three-legged wooden table and a low wooden rack into sharp relief.  Tacked to the wall, a tattered parchment sign flutters in a slight breeze.  A musty pile of rags leans against a narrow shelf that sits slightly askew from the wall."
