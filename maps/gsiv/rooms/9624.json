    "The trail turns here, blocked by a cliff of sheer stone.  Water seeps from a fissure in the stone about twenty feet up, dribbling down to the base and running off to the east.  The flat rock surface, dampened by the running water, presents no means of ascent.  The water, though, seems pure enough, perhaps filtered by its passage through the rock strata."
