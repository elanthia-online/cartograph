    "Subtle scents of spice and oils fill the air.  There is a sense of seclusion to the loft even though the lounge below is just a good shout away.  A few pillows are strewn along the overstuffed caramel suede corner couch, and a silky shag rug of ivory wool tipped with silver complements the rich mahogany floor.  Across from an arched window is an oil painting with a pair of spiraled mithglin sconces mounted on each side and a small claw-footed table that has been carefully arranged below it."
