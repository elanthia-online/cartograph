    "The driftwood plank floor here has been covered with scattered sand, as if someone tracked it in from the beach.  Each of the four walls has been panelled and covered with different materials giving the room a motley quiltwork feeling.  Groups of suntanned customers mill about the room, searching through sample books and pointing out various designs."
