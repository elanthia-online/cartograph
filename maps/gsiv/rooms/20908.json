    "Leaning out away from the tree, a thick twisted branch creates a comfortable perch.  A line of black beetles marches along, following the bark's pattern.  Visibility is clouded with the heavy mist that thickens towards the upper limbs.  Patches of soft moss grow over much of the visible surface, making it difficult to move about."
