    "River birds dart to and fro as they search for a choice morsel dropped from the fishermen's haul.  Nets spread out drying on tall wooden structures line the bank downstream from the dock, their latticed cords impeccably mended.  The slate of the square to the northwest lines the riverbank, providing a perfect place to take in the sights of the river and a border for the grassy lawn between the bank and the rest of the gentle slope.",
    "A black-capped night heron hunches on a piling, keeping silent sentry over the starlit surface of the stream.  Nets spread out drying on tall wooden structures line the bank downstream from the dock, their latticed cords impeccably mended.  The slate of the square to the northwest lines the riverbank, providing a perfect place to take in the sights of the river and a border for the grassy lawn between the bank and the rest of the gentle slope."
