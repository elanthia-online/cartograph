    "The walls of the pavilion bow outwards in this space, forming a spherical area with a sunken floor that is lined with sand.  In the center of the space, two figures are depicted back to back, their features stylistically muddled.  Each stands poised to fight, but vivid coloring implies grave wounds for the pair of them.  The canvas walls around the space are painted with vivid depictions of what can only be a demonic horde.  Directly in front of the two figures is a bright brass plaque."
