  "description": [
    "This remote northeast end of Wehnimer's Landing, swept by the fresh breeze from the bay, seems far removed from the commerce and activity of the town to the west.  A few guards and militiamen patrol here, the intense look on their faces as the watches come and go bespeaking of the importance of the round-the-clock vigil they keep."
