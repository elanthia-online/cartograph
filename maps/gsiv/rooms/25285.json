    "This room is pleasantly bright and airy.  Along the western wall is a large stone fireplace with an ornate modwir mantle, flanked by four huge windows.  The floor-length silk curtains feather softly as a breeze carries the scent of jasmine and honeysuckle through the room.  A large four-poster bed dominates the center of the chamber, shrouded by white silk veils draping from its posts."
