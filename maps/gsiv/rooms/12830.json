    "An assortment of sharpened black scimitars rests on an elaborate wrought iron rack, off to one side of the red-veined white marble street.  A tall muscular warrior stands nearby, eyeing the strangers as they pass and nodding cautiously to the residents.  Rows of red marble benches are placed along the entire length of the strand, with tall lush green topiaries lining the other side.  An occasional break in the greenery allows for a walkway to the houses built back off the strand."
