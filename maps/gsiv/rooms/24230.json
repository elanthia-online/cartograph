  "description": [
    "Small candles scattered about the hovel illuminate the area allowing a full view of the wares for sale in the rundown building.  The aroma of the surrounding swamp drifts in through all the cracks and gaps in the hovel's walls.  Some decrepit shelving lines one wall showing off the different items for sale.  In front of the shelves a sturdy counter sits where people are helped with their purchases.  Across from the counter is a battered driftwood door that leads to a backroom."
