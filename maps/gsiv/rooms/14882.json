    "This niche is striking because of its austerity.  A tall, dark green hedge encloses the small square on three sides, its foliage contrasting with the white crushed gravel underfoot.  The only object is a giant mithril oil lamp in the shape of a bowl set on an elevated granite pedestal.  Flames leap high into the air from the surface of the bowl in a never-ending dance of light."
