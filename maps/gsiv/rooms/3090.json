    "A huge ice-covered boulder blocks the road, forcing the flow of traffic to split around its massive bulk to get by.  A set of stairs is cut into the stone, enabling the more adventurous to climb to its windswept top for a view of the valley to the northwest.  A chain across the bottom of the stairs announces that the vantage point is closed until further notice."
