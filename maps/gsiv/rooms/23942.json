    "Large oak barrels support a long, smooth plank creating a makeshift counter along the far wall, a glass display case hung on the wall behind next to a small sign.  A strong scent of vinegar wafts from a squat, green glass jar filled with pickles perched on the end of the counter, its metal lid turned over and used as a dish for toothpicks and spare silver coins.  A wooden rack, leaning slightly to one side and stained with various shades of green, blocks the curtained archway leading further into the shop."
