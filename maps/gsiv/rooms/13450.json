    "Where the cobblestone lane turns a corner, an imposing marble statue guards the curve.  High above on its pedestal, the muscular figure of a man battles a rearing steed, its mane, tail and curled forelegs creating lyrical harmonies of curve and balance.  Houses watch the frozen tableau, their facades as timeless as the eternal struggle they observe."
