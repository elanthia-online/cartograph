    "A miniature garden of glowing toadstools occupies a recessed niche running the length of the wall behind a faux-mahogany desk.  Hung across from each other are an invar-studded crossbow and a muted green tapestry.  Colorful metal charms clink melodically against each other, suspended from a whimsical mobile in the corner of the office."
