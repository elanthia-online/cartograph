    "A headless scarecrow hangs from a cedar pole amidst the corn stalks.",
    "A headless scarecrow hangs from a cedar pole amidst the corn stalks.  A brown canvas shirt, tightly stuffed with dried wheat sheaves, sits atop a pair of blue canvas pants, equally stuffed with the same material.  The shirt's sleeves have been stuffed in such a manner that they protrude outward at right angles to the body of the shirt, as if the scarecrow is waiting to catch something large or about to flap its arms.  From the liberal amount of bird droppings on the shirt, the birds are unimpressed."
