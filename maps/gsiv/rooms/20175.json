  "description": [
    "Neither trees nor brush add greenery to this large mud-flat at the apex of multiple pathways.  Deep rivulets and gouges mark the path of rainfall where it journeys from the higher ground inland, down towards the open water.  Fastidiously moored in the intransigent mud, a dilapidated boat with a twisted rope drooping down from its interior provides both respite, and an invitation for yet more revelry."
