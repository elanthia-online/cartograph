  "description": [
    "The opaque black silk walls give this room an oppressive air, as little light penetrates the fabric.  A row of three lanterns dangles from the ceiling, and scented smoke escapes the glass confinement along with a luminescence that illuminates the room below.  Off to the side, several chairs offer places to sit, while in the center, a low, expansive mahogany platform takes up much of the available space.  A beaded curtain leads out of the room."
