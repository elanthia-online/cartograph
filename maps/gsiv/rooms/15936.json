    "Dominating this somber chamber, a large altar on the west wall sits below a trio of tall, stained-glass windows that allow sunlight to bathe the room in a myriad of colors.  Next to the larger altar is a smaller one made using simple lines that complement the dark stone of the wall.  This particular altar is dedicated to the Pantheon of Liabo, while the larger, more prominent altar is dedicated to Koar.  The surface of the floor is kept meticulously clean and is fashioned from polished, stark white marble.",
