    "The stairs curve up toward the west, dark with shadow and treacherous with ice.  The stone of the outside walls is heavily carved in bas-relief.  Overhead, the ceiling is a distant, shadowy pool of darkness, but the intricate detail of the carved walls can be glimpsed reaching past the point of sight in a rich landscape of embellishment."
