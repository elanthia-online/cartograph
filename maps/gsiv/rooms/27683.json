    "Floor-to-ceiling shelves fill every inch of wall space in this semicircular open office, and wheeled ladders stand ready for the clerk's use in reaching the higher shelves.  At the front of the office stands a long counter, its surface covered with a fine layer of dust that is undisturbed except in the areas surrounding a dainty frosted crystalline nameplate, a metallic instructional notice, and a large, leatherbound book.  Two torches burn on the walls, their light gilding the ubiquitous dust motes that float through the heavy air."
