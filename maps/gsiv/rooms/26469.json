    "Eerie green lights illuminate the silvery mist that flows through the area, the source a strange bioluminescent coral that climbs the side of the dark, shale mountain.  Wind howls through the area and brings with it the acrid scent of salt and the crushing sound of waves slamming into stone.",
    "Wind whistles past the wrought iron railing that encircles the edge of the cliff, its ethereal tendrils bringing with it the salty scent of the ocean and the sound of crashing waves.  Mist darkens the view of anything more than a few feet beyond the edge and spirals about the cobblestone pathway in tiny, twisting swirls.  Bioluminescent coral, roughly resembling the shape and size of red lettuce leaves, climbs the face of the shale mountainside and lends the area a strange off-green hue."
