    "Bustling kitchen staff work in organized harmony, rotating about cooking stations dedicated to everything from roasting whole animals to piping the frosting on desserts.  The smells of baking bread, roasting meat, and sweet fruit compotes permeate the area.  Wide double doors make up the west wall, allowing the wait staff entrance to the restaurant."
