  "description": [
    "Here and there, the hastily dug tunnel breaches into ancient burial plots.  The path is littered with silvery splinters of wood from old coffins.  Dessicated, bony body parts hang from the ruined caskets, along with trailing shreds of moth-eaten velvet that stir in any passing wind as if they are waving morbidly to passersby."
