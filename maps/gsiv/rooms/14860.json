  "description": [
    "The trail ends at the foot of a tall course of weathered fieldstone steps, which winds up the bluff accompanied by large hostas and ferns.  High above, a dense company of trees crowns the head of the precipice, bolstered by an impassable jumble of huge boulders and tangled blackberry thickets stretching down the incline."
