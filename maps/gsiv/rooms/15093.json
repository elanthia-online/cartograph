    "A painted silk wall panel hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls, and a glossy modwir plank ceiling rises overhead.  A red-haired mermaid statue sits in one corner of a mistwood plank floor.  There is an oversized sea chest on one side of the shop and a floral-etched ceramic case on the other."
