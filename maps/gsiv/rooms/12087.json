    "What appears to be a thick projection of tangled vegetation is in reality the broken base of a wide stone arch that once supported a section of the city wall.  A piled mass of blocks at the edge of the river, crowded over with a thick growth of bushes and trees, bear mute testimony of the massive structure that once spanned the width of the water."
