  "description": [
    "The aisle works its way around the glacial mass, growing narrow then wide with the permutations of the ice.  The single, massive drake guarding the nave's approach has transmuted into a large adult, surrounded by a brace of smaller wyrms flying in perfect symmetry beneath the adult's outstretched wings.  The three spiral up towards the ceiling high above in a silent, joyful dance, looking as if they are caught in the space of a heartbeat, frozen for the ages."
