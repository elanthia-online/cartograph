    "Scraps of brightly colored cloth are swept neatly into the corner near the large working table of this showroom.  Flags, ensigns, and banners depend from the rafters in a bright array of primary colors.  Benches surround the worktable, where a number of local seamstresses sit chattering as they stitch their latest flag.  A large sign displays the selection of standard flags currently in stock."
