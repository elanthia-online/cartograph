  "description": [
    "The wall comes to an end at the tall barbican tower rising over the West Gate of the city.  A window provides the only access to the tower, and that only from the most difficult height.  To the west can be seen the Warrior's Guild compound and the Nightowl Pub, while immediately beneath the wall a variety of unsavory types make their way down the narrow thoroughfare known as Brewer's Alley."
