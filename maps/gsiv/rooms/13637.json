    "The broad sweep of the golden oak floor is interrupted by a tarnished brass urn.  Halfway to the wooden ceiling, a tasteful rune staff display hangs on one of the grey watered silk walls.  An elegantly carved oak armoire and a large cherrywood cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
