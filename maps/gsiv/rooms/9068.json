    "The walls are littered with hooks and shelves covered in various tools of animal handling.  Stacks of falconry gloves and brushes are piled in one corner while a long oak counter sits in the other.  A large sign rests on top of the counter, and behind it a sales clerk that looks about his area of the shop."
