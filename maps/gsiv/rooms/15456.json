    "Polished oak walls rise from a polished oak floor.  Just above a multicolored giant toy rolton hangs a brilliant peacock painting, and a varnished golden oak ceiling completes the picture.  A flexible willow woven basket and a beveled glass-covered case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
