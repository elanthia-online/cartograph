    "The broad sweep of the marble floor is interrupted by some puffed raw silk pillows.  Halfway to the skylight-set ceiling, a detailed landscape painting hangs on one of the gold-veined marble walls.  An aqua-hued seaglass display and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
