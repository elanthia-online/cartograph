    "Tall strands of wyrmwood trees rise along the southern edge of the small clearing, their distant tops shrouded in creeper vines and a crown of verdant leaves.  Round boulders, mostly buried into the soft soil, rise across the landscape to create an uneven ground that is devoid of growth.  Wisps of mist rise from the shadowed surroundings, their ethereal tendrils cold and moist.",
    "Tall strands of wyrmwood trees rise along the southern edge of the small clearing, their distant tops shrouded in creeper vines and a crown of verdant leaves.  An adolescent gnomish boy lounges atop one of the many large, round boulders, which are mostly buried in the soft soil and rise across the landscape to create an uneven ground that is devoid of growth.  Wisps of cold mist rise from the shadowed surroundings, their ethereal tendrils nearly concealing a pile of fist-sized rocks sitting near a plank ramp."
