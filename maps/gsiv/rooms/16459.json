  "description": [
    "The whitewashed brick walls of the tidy office are arranged with numerous small paintings of a variety of modest buildings of wood and stone.  A smiling half-elven woman, her dark hair swept up in a neat snood, oversees the room from a spacious modwir desk, arranging neat stacks of parchments and sketches as she hums quietly to herself.  A narrow stairway leads down."
