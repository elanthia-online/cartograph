    "This narrow dirt path hugs the northern wall of the black basalt spider shrine.  Two of the eight stone annexes, the legs of the spider goddess in whose likeness the shrine was erected, curve around you to the east and west in a sinister embrace.  A few tall pines, with dark green moss clinging to their trunks, cast deeper shadows over the brooding scene."
