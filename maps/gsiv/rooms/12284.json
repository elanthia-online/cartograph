    "The interior of this shop has been crafted to resemble the natural habitats of its occupants.  Plush grass and flowerbeds serve as the floor.  An enormous skylight delivers the sun's light and warmth to the expansive room.  A series of small, open-air rooms branch from the atrium in an arc opposite the entry.  Within each room a variety of tame creatures can be seen.  A cacophony of animal sounds fills the air.",
