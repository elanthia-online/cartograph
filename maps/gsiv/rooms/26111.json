    "The ancient trees populating the garden are obviously much older than the park itself.  Branches grow down to the ground, forming attendant yews around a central ancestor.  Legend holds that the yew grows a root into the open mouth of each corpse buried around it.  The garden's rampant growth is disturbing in that context."
