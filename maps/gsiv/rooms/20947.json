    "Cradled by an inclined drop from the jungle above, the freshwater pool flows out to a more natural shoreline.  To the east lies the easiest access to the lowlands beyond the water's edge, while tall sedge grasses, with stalks towering double the height of a giantman, block egress to the south and west.  Some submerged stones climb up a gradiant and out of the pond, inching toward the main forest floor."
