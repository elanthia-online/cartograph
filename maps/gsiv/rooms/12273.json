    "The path continues as the thick undergrowth of the forest give way to grasslands.  Small stones and tiny bits of seashells are mixed in with the coarse sand of the walkway, creating a crunching sound with each footfall.  Tall island grasses look like the waves as they flutter and bow in the stiff island breeze.",
    "The path continues as the thick trees to the north give way to grasslands.  Lanterns hanging from the branches illuminate several small whitewashed stones, and tiny bits of seashells mixed in with the coarse sand of the walkway create a crunching sound with each footfall.  Tall island grass look like waves as they flutter and bow in the stiff island breeze."
