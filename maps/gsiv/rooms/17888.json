    "[Decrepit Captain's Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Fashioned from various bits of bric-a-brac, this once fine captain's table has been repaired, replaced, and refinished like a patchwork quilt. One leg has been substituted with a splintering baluster, while another has been fitted with a pockmarked chunk of white coral on the end to make up for its short length. Spilled tankards, careless daggers, and greasy foods render the wood a rich dark mahogany, dotted with nicks and gouges that house an array of sticky, unsavory substances within their crevices."
