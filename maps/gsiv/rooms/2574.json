    "Two side paths branch off of the main trail here, running east and west around the mountain.  The north-south path is steeper, but is wider and more deeply worn even so.  A cold wind blows in from the east, and you see signs of snow on the eastern slopes.  The western face seems a bit warmer -- you even fancy you glimpse some green grass in the distance in that direction.",
