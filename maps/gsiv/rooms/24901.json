    "A long oak worktable, littered with crumpled parchments and empty flasks, sits beside an empty bookshelf, its contents strewn across the dusty floor planks.  On the opposite soot-darkened stone wall, a large cauldron, empty except for some shriveled spiders long dead, hangs in an unlit fireplace laid with a stack of dried wood.  Beneath a glaes-paned window sits a hefty faewood chest carved with strange symbols and wrapped with heavy, padlocked chains."
