    "Foot traffic moves steadily past a trio of tents clustered around a firepit to the south, and a similar set of tents and firepit to the north.",
    "A trio of tents cluster around a firepit to the south, huddling against the considerable activity of a large caravaner's tent to the north.  Several disgruntled-looking yaks are yoked up to hitches at the tent's front, and a constant stream of caravans moves to and from its open-air embrace, filling the area with the squeaking music of wagon wheels."
