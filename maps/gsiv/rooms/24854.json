    "A blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the mahogany paneled walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A handblown double-heart bottle sits in one corner of a glossy mahogany floor.  There is a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on one side of the shop and a vine-carved mahogany table on the other."
