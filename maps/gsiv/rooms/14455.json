    "Warmth infuses the room as it radiates from the fire crackling in the marble fireplace.  Large, walnut bookcases fill one wall from floor to ceiling, stuffed with titles from every imaginable topic.  An imposing desk sits in the back of the room, its dark walnut finish gleaming with the flickering firelight."
