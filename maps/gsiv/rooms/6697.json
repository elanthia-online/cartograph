    "This seems to be the home of the cave gnolls.  A few piles of lichen and mushrooms lie stacked along the western wall.  Stacked along the southern wall are several casks of some sort of gnollish wine.  A rack of dried fish leans against the eastern wall.  The central part of this chamber has a few fur pelts and a couple piles of bare white bones.  To the north the cave opens to a wider area, and to the southeast lies a very dark cavern."
