  "description": [
    "A short, narrow entry widens out into an oval-shaped room.  A bed abuts the wall at the room's north end, and a toadstool in a stone pot sits in the wider curve of the oval, easily lighting the entire room.  Umber carpet covers the floor, and five narrow black lines run north from the faux-walnut door on the south wall to disappear underneath the bed.  The curving granite wall encompassing the room and the ceiling are painted a matching umber color, though the timbers have been left in their natural state."
