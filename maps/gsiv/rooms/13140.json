    "The taskmaster stands before a wide map and is the center of a maelstrom of arriving and departing scouts and fellow members of the Guardians of Sunfist.  Two large windows formed from double arches are set into one wall of the room, while several shelves lining the walls opposite are covered in both spent and new candles.  A massive axe is leaned on its head in one corner, ready at a moment's notice for use by its owner."
