  "description": [
    "Resembling an exotic jungle encampment, the room's atmosphere is heady with the perfume of flowers growing on the trunks of trees around its perimeter.  Camp chairs and a folding table occupy what looks like a small clearing, and a hammock stretched between trees serves as a bed.  Illumination is provided by a round skylight and a brazier lamp fashioned in the image of a fire.  The ceiling has been painted with a representation of the night sky, with the circular skylight portraying the moon."
