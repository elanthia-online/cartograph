    "Swathes of sky blue fabric stretch across the ceiling and are supported by white birch and rod that are carved into the semblance of tree limbs.  Hanging from each artfully wrought branches are gilded cages that houses a variety of song birds, while far below a floor of lacquered bamboo mimics a grassy meadow.  Fluffy cushions resembling clouds surround circular tables of warm cedar along the edges of the space and a small cast iron stove occupies the center of the room."
