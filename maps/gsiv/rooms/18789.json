    "A glaesine-topped canver workbench dominates the cramped laboratory, one end pushed against the wall so it is immediately beneath a rectangular window.  Atop the window-side of the workbench rests a complicated, ora gem lens assembly.  A glass alembic and an ivory marble crucible also congregate upon the workbench.  Scorch marks mar the white marble floors, and a curtained arch leads northeast to the main hallway.  Moonlight shines upon a brilliantly orange zinnia sitting in the lone, unscorched corner.",
