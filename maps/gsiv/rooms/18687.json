    "Motes of dust can be seen floating through the streams of broken moonlight filtering through a small, grimy window.  A thick mat of reeds covers the rough wooden floor, herbs and dried flowers mixed in to mask other unsavory odors.  Piled up about a polished maoral table is a wide variety of boxes, chests, and trunks.  Tucked to one side is a rounded whiskey barrel bound with strips of rusted iron.",
