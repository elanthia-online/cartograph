    "A pair of cast iron sconces hangs on one of the whitewashed stucco walls, and a mosiac-tiled ceiling rises overhead.  A glass-fronted bookcase sits in one corner of an ornate ceramic tile floor.  There is a tall oak and ivory cabinet on one side of the shop and a clawfooted cherrywood table on the other."
