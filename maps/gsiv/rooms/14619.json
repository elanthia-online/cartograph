    "Branches cross overhead, shading the path as the forest becomes thicker.  Despite the heavy growth of trees, the path seems well-kept and the underbrush has been trimmed back, revealing occasional small houses set among the trunks. Looking through the trees, you see the edge of a rocky ravine falling off just to the north, and the path continues to the northeast."
