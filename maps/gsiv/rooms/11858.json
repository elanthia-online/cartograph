    "A large rectangular space formed by a series of walls built between broken towers, opens out to the north.  The remains of several barrack-like buildings, low and roofless, occupy the opposite end of the field.  Positioned in this corner of the field is the statue of a woman perched on the edge of a wall that circles around a deep well."
