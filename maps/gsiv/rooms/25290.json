  "description": [
    "Set into one wall of this maple-panelled room is a fireplace with a large portrait hanging above it, and several inviting over-stuffed pillows scattered nearby.  A display case rests along the western wall while a bench cluttered with maps takes up the opposite side.  The remaining corner contains a large feather bed with daffodils and maple leaves carved into the headboard."
