    "This part of the road is on the very edge of the glacier.  The cobbles are slippery with ice and tracked-in snow, and most everyone on the road is wearing thick boots and fur-lined cloaks.  To the north you can see a group of guards around a hole in the wall of ice, presumably guarding the entrance to the town."
