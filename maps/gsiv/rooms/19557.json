    "Bending eastward, the protective wall that encircles the vineyard disappears into the verdant foliage.  Draped in wisteria and roses, a latticework bamboo arch provides entry into a jungle-wreathed area that is pock-marked with colorful awnings and vibrant flowers.  Hidden in the foliage is an ornate bronze plaque."
