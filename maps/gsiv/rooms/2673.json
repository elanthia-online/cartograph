    "The stairs culminate in an entry hall, little more than a glorified landing replete with sculpted stone.  Stairwells curving down to the southeast and southwest converge at a double column surmounted by capitals carved in high relief.  Opposite the trumeau, two arches, crafted of alternating dark and reddish-toned granite blocks, open to the northeast and northwest.  Over every surface, the relentless sheath of ice gives a reflective coating that is as lovely as it is precarious."
