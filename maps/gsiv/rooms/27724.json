    "Sawdust is scattered as an aid to traction, as militia guards and other visitors track melting snow and ice across the shallow steps leading from the lower rooms to the upper defenses of the barbican.  Shadows constantly shift in the faint torchlight, retreating with each momentary flare of the flames, then surging forward as the light wanes back into gloomy darkness."
