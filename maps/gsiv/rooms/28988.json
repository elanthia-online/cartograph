  "description": [
    "Framed in ebonwood, a rectangular mirror is mounted on the southern wall, the starlight reflecting off of its smooths surface, while below it cushioned teak benches provide space for quiet repose.  Green shutters frame open, glass-free windows in the northern wall, each providing a view of the streets beyond and bringing cool air into the narrow hallway.  A small cloth-covered table filled with baubles and jewels also houses a driftwood log fitted with scented votives."
