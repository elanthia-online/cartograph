    "In one corner of the chamber, a table created from rocks holds a dozen human skulls.  Huge gaping holes are evident in some of the skulls, a clear indication of how the victim's life had brutally ended.  The remainder of the skeletons are contained within carefully carved out niches from the stone walls.  Some tattered and torn clothing still clings to some of the bones."
