    "Twining vines of ivy creep along the cobblestones, their verdant hue interspersed among the lighter greens of the tall hedge walls that surround the area.  Clusters of bright purple flowers line the borders of the walkway, their deep hue contrasted by flowers of bright white, pale crimson, and sky blue."
