    "Sun reflects in undulating shimmers off of the ruddy sand several paces away from the oasis's fertile shore, making a stark and blazing line between living soil and dead sand.  Just past the demarcation, a steep hillside rises in craggy majesty, overseeing the greenery with a pitted and impassive face.  A cleft splits its base, delving down into cool shadows.",
    "Moonlight blanches the ruddy sand several paces away from the oasis's fertile shore, marking a stark and shining line between living soil and dead sand.  Just past the demarcation, a steep hillside rises in craggy majesty, overseeing the shadowed greenery with a pitted and impassive face.  A near-hidden cleft splits its base, delving down into impenetrable blackness."
