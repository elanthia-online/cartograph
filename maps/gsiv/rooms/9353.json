    "A glance upwards reveals a steep drop from above to the rocky floor of the ravine.  The sides rise so high that most of the ravine is cast in total darkness.  A small stream trickles past, seemingly in no hurry to get anywhere, though the depth of the ravine attests that this was not always so."
