    "This interior room of the wagon is bathed in dappled sunlight from the many gaps between the lashed-together sticks that make up the walls.  A wooden floor stretches from one end to the other, and bulky shapes draped in musty burlap take up much of the floor space.  Near the wagon entrance, a stooped green goblin stands idly by, and near his head hangs a small black metal sign.",
