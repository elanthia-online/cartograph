    "Strong viridian light pulses through the area, the source just out of sight to the southeast, while traces of Tilaok's fiery presence rush in from the north.  Cool white lunar rock rises around the edges of the valley and, though the terrain is rough and irregular, a pathway of gold-veined marble tiles allows for passage through the area.  A protective dome of arcane energy keeps the void of space from reaching this area, it's light reflected in a glowing glass-lined ring."
