    "Pleated silk walls fall in graceful lines from floor to peaked ceiling to create a cozy tent that is light and airy.  White birch partitions offer customers changing spaces near the rear of the tent, as well as supports for various display pieces.  Several armoires stand upon braided rugs dyed in extremely bright colors near a beaded tent flap that leads further into the tent, while a set of clothing racks frames an opening leading out."
