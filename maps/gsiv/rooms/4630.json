    "A small, whitewashed curio cabinet sits diagonally in the corner of the hall, a number of cleverly crafted gem and metal figurines visible through its glass door.  Some appear to have been painted and arranged in mock battles, and while each one is of a size very suitable for a pocket, they do not appear to be mismatched as so many of the guild's other accoutrements are."
