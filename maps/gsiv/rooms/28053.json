    "Heat rises in clouds of steam from a pot-bellied ceramic stove, filling the tent with a cozy warmth that disperses the alpine chill beyond the simple canvas walls.  Hooks hang from the wrought iron supports to display several pendants, while a low round wooden table at the center of the oak floor panels has several bracelets arranged for viewing."
