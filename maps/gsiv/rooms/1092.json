    "[Dead Plateau, River Chasm]"

  "description": [
    "The river crevice runs straight and true in a northwest/southeast direction.  Neither rising nor falling, the path follows the crevice's edge closely.  The rock surface feels dry and solid, even at the edge of the chasm.  Even for stone, though, this surface is hard and unyielding.  The cracks that infest the interior move closer to the chasm's edge, squeezing the passage at many points and funneling travel into walkways that allow passage only one person wide."
