    "A shallow puddle surrounded by a darker ring of sand punctuates the otherwise dry powdery surface of the old creek bed.  Water seeps in a slow trickle between the mud-wattled logs that form the natural dam here.  The logs have fallen in a staggered pattern, acting as the only scalable way out of the gulch."
