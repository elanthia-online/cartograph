  "description": [
    "Carved directly into the side of the imposing cliff face is a monolithic sculpture of a reptilian being.  Its features are blurred from wind, rain, and the passage of time, but gangly, claw-tipped forelimbs and a thick, scale-carved tail clearly identify the figure as a native inhabitant of these lands.  Golden reflections undulate off mica flecks imbedded in the rock face, lending a life-like quality to the imposing figure."
