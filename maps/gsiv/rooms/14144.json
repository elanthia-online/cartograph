    "The frescos have been painted by masterful hands, and surely this work could not have been completed in one artisan's lifetime.  A new element has been introduced into the motif of a large hole, or tear in the sky.  From it pours thousands of monstrous creations, of the like which you have never seen.  Further down the hall you see the imagery of a tremendous battle, and the final outcome of a barren wasteland."
