    "[Underground, Cistern]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The dimensions of this chamber are breathtaking, such that it could only have been naturally wrought, and it echoes with the sound of water lapping against stone.  Evidenced by the scent of the sea, the cistern is fed from an underground channel, and its waters break in shallow waves chased by the cyan glow emitted by the crystals dappled across the arching ceiling and convex walls.  The effect is otherwordly and seems in sharp contrast to the mundanity of the furnishings haphazardly arranged throughout."
