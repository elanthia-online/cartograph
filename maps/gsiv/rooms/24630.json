    "Luxurious velvet carpeting covers the floor of the pavilion.  To one side of the entryway stands a thick-framed mirror.  Rippled glass-shaded lanterns hover overhead, casting a warm aura of light about the area.  Against the very back wall, a pair of mannequins stand perpendicular to the silk, providing ample room to walk between and around each."
