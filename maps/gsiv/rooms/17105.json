    "A dim light glows off refined oak-paneled walls, giving the winery a cozy feel.  Footsteps echo upon a varnished dark oak floor, at the center of which stands a glaes-topped dark mistwood bar.  Soft watery motes of light emanate from an ultramarine blue glaes aquarium, which offsets a gold-whorled waterfall wine rack.  A driftwood and aspen framed painting has been hung between the east and west corridors, which are blanketed by a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling embroidered with soft grey vines."
