    "Strong scents of peat and decay suffuse the small room, which is dimly lit by candles suspended between a handful of gaps in the ceiling.  Arranged in orderly fashion are four tables stocked with armor, weapons, arcane items, and other treasures.  Leaning against one of the earthen and limestone walls is a swamp goblin sales clerk, his gaze constantly shifting between the merchandise and a stiff curtain.",
