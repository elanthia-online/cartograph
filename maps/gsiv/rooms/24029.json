    "Polished stone walls reflect the light of a trio of steel-banded torches that has been inset into ornate brackets.  Centered over a brick-lined tunnel is a forest green banner that reads \"Arena Entrance\" embroidered in thick indigo thread.  An indigo banner over a forest green arch reads \"Viewing Chamber\" in elegant azure embroidery."
