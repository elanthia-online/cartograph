  "description": [
    "A dimly lit gallery, framed with grey stone walls, houses a single cloth-covered trestle table.  Hanging above are a series of gilt-framed paintings and hunting trophies, each festooned with evergreen boughs and spaced by candle-filled sconces.  A decorative carpet runner covers most of the bare stone floor, leading from a swinging door marked \"Buttery\" at one end to a narrow spiral staircase at the other, with a solid ironwood door visible at the top."
