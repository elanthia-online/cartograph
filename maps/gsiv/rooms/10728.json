  "description": [
    "Long arm bones have been planted in the ground, giving the impression of a field of growing bone.  The night breeze lazily blows through the area, bringing even more chill to the night's cool temperature.  Skeletal hands cap a few of the arms like ghastly blooms on a grisly plant.  A rolton skull rests across two of the vertical bones.",
