    "Taking up the entire expanse of the eastern wall is an enormous linen map surrounded by linden framed cubby-holes hung upon the limestone.  At the center of the room is an oversized meeting table with oak benches provided for seating.  An alcove in the northern wall fitted with a low serving table discreetly hides the kitchen entryway."
