    "A slight cant to the floor diverts the waterfall into a small pond, its waters swirling counterclockwise until they spill out over the south edge and rush down the cavern's slope again.  Brightly colored fish swim in the pond, clustering where the water flow is slowest.  Several blue marble benches rest near a shelf bearing food and drinks, and a pink granite receptacle sits unobtrusively to the side.  Two sapphire toadstools cast their light into the area and streak the cavern with deep blue glow."
