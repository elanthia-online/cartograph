  "description": [
    "Overturned, overlapped, and oversized boulders make passage along the barely discernable path nearly impossible.  Broken and sheared-off surfaces across the cliff face immediately overhead suggest evidence of a recent rockslide.  The crushed skeletal remains of rodents and reptiles lay half-buried in the rubble, indicating not all escaped the path of the falling debris."
