    "The trees to either side of the path are bunched together, their thick foliage overhead casting the path into total darkness.  The scent of smoke is recognizable on the air, acrid and sharp, and a faint twinkle of light can be seen in the distance.  The air is cool, and a slight breeze carries the faint sound of a jaunty flute to your ears."
