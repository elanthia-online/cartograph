    "The rough-cut wooden logs of the walls are covered with the skins and furs of a variety of local animals, from a huge, stinking bear skin on one wall to the smaller pelts of rabbits and squirrels, all in various states of cleaning and preparation and all exuding an overpowering smell of rotting flesh.  A snake skin twice as long as a giantman is tall is draped over a crude drying rack, its fanged head still attached."
