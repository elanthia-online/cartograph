    "Small children slide gleefully along the packed down snow and ice-covered path, laughing as they collide and fall face first into the snowy eastern and western banks.  Their guardians follow closely, simultaneously scolding them softly and chortling at the childrens' silliness.  From time to time, an errant snowball goes flying overhead and smashes solidly into a coniferous tree, causing its branches to shudder."
