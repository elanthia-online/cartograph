    "Not as narrow a precipice as it seems from below, this rock shelf can easily hold several people and is directly across from the widest point of the arching waterfall.  Down below, foamy water churns in a deep basin, then runs off into a creek that encircles the canyon floor.  Above, the fine mist picks out a pale moonbow that forms from the soft lunar light.",
