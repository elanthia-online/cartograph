    "Sunlight filters in through colored glass windows that have been placed into the wall, fragmenting into a myriad of colors across the length of the floor.  Two candles stand near a decorative fountain in the center of the room, each casting a warm glow across the chapel.  An assortment of tapestries and banners has been hung along the perimeter of the room, fluttering occasionally in response to a draft.  Directly beneath each of the wall hangings sits a small altar and a plain velvet pillow.",
