    "Hanging from the supports above and contrasting with the pale natural wool of the shelter lining are a trio of lamps.  Covering the ground is a large rug of braided saffron cotton, each ring wider than the last in a spiraling pattern.  Centered in the space is a rounded walnut bed covered with a thick down comforter.  The headboard is carved with a pattern of eagles in flight."
