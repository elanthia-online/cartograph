    "Shelves filled with fabrics, neatly labeled boxes, and glass canisters, line the wall behind a polished hardwood counter.  A dark walnut bureau is reflected in the silvered glass of a large oval mirror, its elaborately carved frame of leaves inlaid with pearly vaalin.  To one side of the counter, a metal rack is crowded with garments, and on the other, a low wooden shoe rack is angled in front of a cushioned bench."
