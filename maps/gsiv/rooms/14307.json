    "Worn and irregular cobblestones line the narrow dark alley.  A few of the stones are uneven and have been uprooted from where they were set.  Trash and debris flow freely through the passage, an obvious statement of the neighborhood's condition.  A filth-covered door is inset into the wall of the eastern building and a small wooden sign hangs crookedly above it."
