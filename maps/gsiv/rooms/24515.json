    "The high-ceilinged room is paneled in pale cream, almost wheaten, slabs of polished alabaster.  A deep-bowled basin, its interior and jutting taps plated in pewter, stands against a slick alabaster wall inset with a door and an arch.  Tesserae in a blend of the same hues form a spiraling mosaic pattern on the floor.  Sectioning off one portion of the chamber is a metallic screen."
