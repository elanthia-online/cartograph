  "description": [
    "A deep, smoldering fire pit at the center of the tent fills the air with an arid scent and an almost overwhelming warmth.  As its dying embers provide only minimal illumination, candles on crude wooden holders have been selectively placed at each display.  Overhead, lengths of sturdy twine have been strung, supporting a variety of dried or drying body parts, some more readily identifiable than others.   Underfoot, old and decaying boards crisscross the spongy-wet ground to create a passable walking space."
