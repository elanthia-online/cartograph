    "A huge four poster bed with a carved canopy spans a plush multicolored tapestry rug in this tranquil and luxurious master suite.  From the crisply pressed linens to the arrangement of fresh lilacs, no comfort has been overlooked.  A carafe of chilled water and a crystal biscuit jar rests on a silvery haon nightstand.  An alabaster bathtub and a shelf of fluffy towels are tucked behind a curved screen.  Two wingback armchairs are drawn up near a marble fireplace with a small table set between them."
