    "A series of riverstones forms a walkway bisecting this small yard, leading to the frond-roofed bungalow.  The grass, lush and green by the arch, shows patches of yellow and brown near the bungalow.  Faint traces of sharp smells hover in the air.  The old brass sign attached to the bungalow's door is unnaturally bright in the moonlight.",
