  "description": [
    "The path branches, leading north toward the lake and another arm leading toward the sound of a stream gurgling to the northeast.  A monstrous oak is visible guarding the trail to the west.  Thick banks of ferns surround the crossroads, their fronds waving languidly in the breeze.  A couple of cabins sit in the midst of the ferns, small patches of flowers planted around them."
