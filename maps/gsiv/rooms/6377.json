  "description": [
    "You stand at a high pass between two higher peaks.  To the northwest, the trail leads down, out of the foothills.  The southeast trail leads deeper into the Trollfang Mountains.  Looking either side of the pass, you can see isolated patches of low lying fog.  The silvery sheen of the misty patches bears out the reason that this place is called \"The Land of the Silver Mists.\""
