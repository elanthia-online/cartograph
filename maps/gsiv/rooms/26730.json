  "description": [
    "Dark shale walls, slick from the extreme moisture in the air, glisten in the firelight that is produced by bamboo pole torches that are rooted into the dense, sandy ground.  Branching coral structures form a sort of canopy over the area, their orange, teal, and white limbs intertwined in a latticework of crystalline branches.  Warped benches form loose, social clusters in three of the four corners, while a small table offers a variety of local delicacies."
