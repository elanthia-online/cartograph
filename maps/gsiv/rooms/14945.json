    "An expanse of field extends to the south, bounded by a low wooden fence that winds and curves through the rolling grasslands.  The pasture grass is cropped short by the grazing herds of rolton that wander here and there.  Several cottages are set near the path, surrounded by small picket fences to keep the roltons out of the flowerbeds."
