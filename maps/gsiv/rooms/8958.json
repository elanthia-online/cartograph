  "description": [
    "A giant brass ship's bell sits at the eastern edge of Gunner's Lane, a remnant of the seafaring past of many of the inhabitants of the burrow.  A silver plaque on the bell has long since been rendered unreadable by the opaque ice and snow plastered to it by the frequent inclement weather.  The immense frame holding the entire piece off the ground shows signs of wear, cracked in several places."
