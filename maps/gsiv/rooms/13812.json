    "Along the edge of the bluff, cottages compete with oak trees for the spectacular view of Lough Ne'halin.  A dense mixed-wood forest guards the trail's western edge, with cottages set into the trees in a haphazard array.  Wild flowers add tiny dots of color to the landscape, their pin-points of color peeking cheerfully out of the drifting fog."
