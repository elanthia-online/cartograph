  "description": [
    "Painted bright white, the northern wall of the kitchen is riddled with large and small ovens that have been built directly into the natural granite of the ridge the outpost sits upon.  Large windows, wide open to the elements, are covered with heavy bars, which are largely hidden by the various flora-heavy urns and vessels bolted there.  Several utilitarian stools are arranged before a long teak counter that is covered with warm dishes and filled tankards."
