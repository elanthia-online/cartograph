  "description": [
    "Huge piles of hay lie scattered all over the dirty wood floor of this loft.  A hook and pulley system high overhead serves to bring bales of hay to the main floor.   Coils of rope and several other tools hang from pegs on the far wall.  Two oil lanterns on either side of the open window light up the room, while the sound of chirping crickets drifts in from outside.  A clear space on the floor right near the wooden ladder is set up with a low three-legged stool and a large woven mat.",

Coils of rope and several other tools hang from pegs on the far wall.  An open window lets in the warm breeze from outside stirring the heavy scent of fresh hay that suffocates the air.  A clear space on the floor right near a narrow wooden ladder is set up with a low three-legged stool and a large woven mat."
