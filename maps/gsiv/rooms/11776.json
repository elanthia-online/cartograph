    "A battered and abandoned general store that is slowly sinking into the marsh doesn't look as if it will be opening anytime soon, but that hasn't stopped anybody from building a few ramshackle huts along the somewhat dry gnoll.  A tall stick peers out of the deep mud, the pole etched top to bottom with crude scratch marks.",
