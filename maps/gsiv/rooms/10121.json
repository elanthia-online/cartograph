  "description": [
    "Dirt pebbled with rounded stones form this pass that concludes at the bank of a lake to the north.  A short dock juts out from the rocky shoreline, studded with faded crimson and yellow mooring floats.  Though the grade of the climb to the forest towards the south is slight and gradual, the view from this distance is still remarkable."
