  "description": [
    "Howling winds crash against the granite bulwark of the fortress and sweep the area clean of any debris, which makes the ground smooth and vacant.  Deep gashes in the walls create jagged marks that mar the smooth, almost sterile atmosphere for the pathway.  A lone boulder, completely bare of grass, dirt, or lichen, gleams in the moonlight."
