    "Several large trees have been felled near the path here, and the stumps of the trees are still fresh and flat.  Blue-jays and mockingbirds that perch on the stumps dart away at the approach of travelers.  The underbrush has been cleared away to cut the trees, and the stumps stand out in contrast to the surrounding forest."
