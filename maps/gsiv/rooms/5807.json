    "A solitary lantern, its flame small but bright, casts a welcome light on the broad passage.  The tunnel doesn't seem to have been used lately, and a litter of old rags and bones is piled in drifts along the walls.  A vein of mica sparkles in the lantern's flickering light, a surprising hint of ethereal beauty amidst the sameness of grey rock and pale dust."
