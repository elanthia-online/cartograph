    "Tasteful paintings hang on the wall, each one depicting a beach scene at a different time of day.  A thick blue rug covers the pale plank flooring, while a solid oak bed stands against the far wall.  Pale yellow curtains flutter in the cool breeze let in from the open window.  Crickets and the rustling of leaves can be heard faintly from outside.  An overstuffed blue chair rests between an antique willow armoire and the blue driftwood door leading out."
