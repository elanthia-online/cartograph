    "Numerous bales of freshly cut golden hay fill a large stall on the northern side of the spacious alley.  Red-handled pitchforks stand upright, spearing the hay bales, while a small green cart stands close by.  Stray stalks of hay weave themselves between the cracks of the dark grey cobblestones that make up the floor.  On the southern side of the wide alley are two stalls, their lower half-doors latched with blued-steel hardware."
