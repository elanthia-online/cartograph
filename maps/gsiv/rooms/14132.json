    "The supple earth underfoot slopes downward into a low-set copse bordered by a circle of flourishing rowan trees.  Weedy grey-green grasses reveal silvery overtones as they undulate in a light breeze, revealing a glimpse of orange-blushed pomes cradled within.  At the center of the ring, a bed of sweet-scented heliotrope surrounds a carved modwir altar."
