    "A large hole in the otherwise nondescript dirt walls is the only thing that breaks the uniformly dull surroundings.  The hole's progress has been stopped by what appears to be a block of granite only a few feet within the wall, its rough surface holding scratchy, dark stains.  The dusty earthen floor also shows signs of having granite beneath it, some of the more worn sections revealing the dark grey patches of rock."
