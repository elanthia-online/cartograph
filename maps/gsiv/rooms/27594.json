  "description": [
    "A large credenza occupies the back wall of this cozy room, its surface laden with a variety of herbs, florals, and oils all trapped within stoppered apothecary bottles.  A blackened skull on a violet lace doily sits amongst the glass, as does a black onyx mortar and pestle.  Perpendicular to the credenza is an arsenic grey velvet-cushioned couch with a high back and sculpted arms."
