    "A crowd of mostly women bustles about, talking and trading and bartering for daily staples.  Foods and goods of various purpose exchange hands, creating a makeshift market in the little town.  An open ramada shades a number of exotic foods and whatnots, the shopkeeper beckoning all passers-by to come and see."
