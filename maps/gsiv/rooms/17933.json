    "This once elegant foyer retains the vestiges of its former beauty.  A deep crimson rug lies across the darkened rosewood planks, softening visitors' footfalls.  Dark-red velvet curtains hang from dust-covered windows, preventing passersby from looking in.  The front door has been nailed shut, rendering it useless as an exit.  A wide staircase curves up to the railing at the second floor landing."
