    "An enormous blue ice statue dominates this small cave.  Furnished with simple haon benches ringing the statue, the cave is set up as a respite from the troubles and cares of the world outside.  Walls of smoothed ice render the image on the multifaceted planes of crystal, allowing all angles to be viewed from anywhere in the room.  Ringing the crevice opening for the cave are deeply-carved symbols of Voln."
