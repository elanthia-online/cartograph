    "Once the private library of the magi, this room appears to have been ransacked in earlier times.  Three desks, three chairs, and a large sculpture of a knight slaying a small drake remain.  The understated elegance of the chamber is hinted at by the exquisitely carved bookshelves, still lined with the remains of books, tomes, scrolls and letters."
