    "The temple's facetted glaes cap arches overhead, supported by sandstone pillars.  Deeply carved with designs of winged pegasi, the imagery on the pillars depicts these mystical creatures in flight towards the clear, sky lit ceiling.  Light focused by the lens is absorbed into a crystal orb and reflected outward in a radiant sunburst of gold that suffuses the entire chamber.  Frothy waters, flowing into an ornate bronze fount, gently caress and uplift the brilliant orb with their white-capped waves."
