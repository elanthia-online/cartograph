    "The cavern's ceiling is dotted with stalactites of various hues, creating an odd yet captivating underground landscape.  Passage through this area can be treacherous for non-dwarven folks, as one must be as careful with the loose rocks and uneven walking surface as well as the cave formations overhead."
