  "description": [
    "The fog rolling over the bog breaks for a stretch along the path here, and the walled city of Vornavis can be seen looming off to the east.  Plumes of smoke from forges and cooking fires within the city rise above the walls.  The fires of the city provide no comfort, but instead serve as reminders of the dampness of the bog and the cold dark nights travelers must face here."
