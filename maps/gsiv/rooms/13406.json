    "A large black willow stands within the center of the walkway, the cobblestoned path curving around each side of the tree in order to accommodate its girth.  Trails of thin leaf-swept vines hang low to the ground, each swaying rhythmically as the wind whistles past.  Long reeds waver in unison along the far western bank of the lake, providing a soft staccato beat that subtly meanders through the area."
