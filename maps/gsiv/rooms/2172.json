    "The trail curves around the huge glaes formation, its path zigzagging around lava and rock.  At the edge of a steep embankment on the north, an offshoot of the trail weaves down the incline between a scrub of boulders and strange, stunted bushes with withered-looking, grey leaves.  A few of the shrubs are perched at the edge of small fissures full of lava, their gnarled roots submerged in the liquid rock."
