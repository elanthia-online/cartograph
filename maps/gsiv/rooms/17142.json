  "description": [
    "Brass sconces flank the doorway and are mounted along the walls at regular intervals providing adequate light in the chamber.  Perched atop a dais three steps high, and polished to a mirror finish, rests a massive ebonwood bench that is lightly carved with vines.  Most of the back wall is comprised of a bookcase crammed with thick, leather-bound tomes pertaining to the law.  A featureless metal door stands almost hidden behind the bookshelf.  Gold runners cover the floor between symmetrically arranged padded chairs."
