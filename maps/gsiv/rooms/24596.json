    "Starlight shimmers on the surfaces of the tents pitched nearby, their thin silken walls billowing in the evening breeze.  A makeshift path, lined with small terra cotta pots overflowing with pale pink verbena, has been created between the colorful structures.  Small glaesine globes swing from ironwork posts, dimly illuminating the area."
