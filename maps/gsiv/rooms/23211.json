  "description": [
    "A highly polished marble floor dances with reflected light from the shimmering crystal chandelier overhead.  Next to a large open fireplace sits a white basket filled with wood and kindling.  Nearby, several plush chairs and a carved huntboard add comfort and warmth to the huge room.  Covering the north wall is an elegant mural of White Haven's founders.  A sweeping staircase of carved white modwir gently curves as it ascends to the tower's upper floors."
