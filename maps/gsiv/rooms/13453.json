  "description": [
    "A pebbled lane branches in three directions, the crossroads marked by a large flat stone between the east and southwest forks.  The marker-stone has been carved with elegant script.  To the southwest, a large pond can be seen with moonlight reflected on its surface.  To the east, a group of quaint cottages are nestled at the foot of a tall, tree-covered hill.  Lights in the windows of additional buildings can be glimpsed twinkling within the forest farther up the hill's elevation.",
