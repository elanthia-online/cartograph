    "Heavy with humidity, the air swaddles the surroundings like a wet woolen blanket.  Moisture clings to the verdant vegetation crowding a nearly imperceptible animal path.  Overhead, enormous fronds create a thick canopy, further diffusing the already dappled light, thin dim streams of which offer the merest hint of illumination.  Deep shadows play along the ground, accompanied by soft scurrying sounds.  Cloying in the thick air, a strong perfume emanates from the abundant flowering shrubs."
