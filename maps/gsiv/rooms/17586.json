    "Coiled brambles, supporting dusky dog roses from thorn-riddled limbs, cling to the sturdy slats of the white picket fence that encircles the yard.  Wild crab grass blends in rustic grace with tall blades of blue-green sea grass and surround a simple pathway of crushed seashells.  Marking each end of the pathway is the cottage's closed white door and a wrought iron-hinged gate."
