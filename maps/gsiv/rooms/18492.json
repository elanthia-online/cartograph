    "The variety of fragrant grasses in the hay leaves an almost perfumed smell in the air.  The sun-bleached bales of hay are too densely packed to climb on top of, though it is apparent from some damage to one of them that someone has tried.  It is even possible to see where they landed on the soft corn husk strewn ground."
