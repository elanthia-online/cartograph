    "A quiet, almost solemn ambience drifts through the shop, the sounds muffled by a maze of wall samples and multihued wood paneling.  The back wall is painted white and devoid of decoration. presumably to allow customers to view their selections against it, apart from the rest of the available choices.  Several patrons converse in small groups, probably deciding on their purchases."
