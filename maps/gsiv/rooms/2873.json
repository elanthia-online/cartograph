  "description": [
    "Boulders are strewn helter-skelter, reaching down to a river that plunges in white froth over the stones at the water line.  The sound of the river, while muffled by the fog at any distance, is now a roar, giving testament to the violence of its passing.  The water is a deep shade of grey where the froth isn't churned up, as if it is too cold and quick to embrace a color as gentle as blue."
