  "description": [
    "A misshapen boulder in the center of the clearing gives the place its name.  Wind and elements have chiseled the stone into a form that resembles a gnarled goblin.  To the west, the hillside rises, dotted with small stands of whitethorn trees.  They stand at an angle to the hillside, coaxed into a vertical stance by the light.  Homes huddle in a grove of pines back-lighted by the grey lake to the east."
