    "[Village, Mud Hut]"

  "description": [
    "Few niceties adorn this simple, mud-walled hut.  Woven mats on the ground would seem to barely keep one up out of the muck, and a charred circle of rocks is utilitarian at best.  Scattered pots and dirty utensils rest on the damp, earthen floor, their unwashed surfaces caked in dried food and debris.  Swarms of insects provide music for the home, buzzing in and out of the open doorway both day and night."
