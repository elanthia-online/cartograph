    "White limestone mixes with the tower's dark foundation from its base to its crown and is a marked sign of renovation to the ancient premises.  Against the outer wall, a stone stairway spirals upward towards four landings and is wrapped by dark ebonwood banisters.  Above the stairway, daylight trickles across the eight crenellated points, outlining new and old stone work, some of which glints with foreign metal.",
    "White limestone mixes with the tower's dark foundation from its base to its crown and is a marked sign of renovation to the ancient premises.  Against the outer wall, a stone stairway spirals upward, its course illuminated by bracketed torches and interrupted by four landings.  Above the stairway, the roof of the tower has been removed to expose the night sky and all eight crenellated points have been repaired."
