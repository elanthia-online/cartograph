  "description": [
    "Numerous canvas tents of varying sizes, shapes, and colors nearly fill this small, flat area.  Some of the tents are separated by mere inches, making it difficult to navigate between them.  A weathered wooden sign stands beside a centrally located large wire basket, filled with yet more tents."
