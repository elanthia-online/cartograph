    "Sections of split-rail fence create an enclosure with openings that lead to the very heart of the town.  Set back from the fences is a square wooden table draped with a checkered cloth.  Atop the table, a shallow, cushion-lined tray sits beside a small paper sign, and behind the table is a short, unoccupied stool.",
