    "The trail bends to the southeast and southwest, curving around the base of a hill that rises to the south.  A third track heads in that direction, beginning a climb that ends at a wooden structure perched atop the hill.  By some strange coincidence, a parliament of owls has convened on the limbs of a single red maple at the convergence of the trails."
