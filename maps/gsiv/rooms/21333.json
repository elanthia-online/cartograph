  "description": [
    "Enclosed by Sylvanfair's canopy and the surrounding foliage, this grove maintains a peaceful seclusion despite its lack of walls.  From a hollowed branch above, thin streams of water cascade down into a small pond.  Flat stones peek out just above the water's surface, several of which have been arranged to jut out at the edge as a makeshift dock, while others encircle a small fire pit nearby."
