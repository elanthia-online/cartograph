  "description": [
    "Rough-hewn planks form the walls of this cramped shed, and chilled drafts attest to the lack of skill in their assemblage into their current configuration.  In sharp contrast to the shack and the questionable nature of its continued existence, a polished brass lantern rests atop a glass-fronted case that stands in the middle of the floor.  Its glow illuminates the case, a small velvet-topped table to one side, and some free-standing shelves holding stacks of writing materials, each stack topped by a rock to keep the sheets off the floor."
