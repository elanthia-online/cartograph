    "The alley curves smoothly from southwest to southeast, the buildings curving with a grace that is otherwise absent in the narrow passage.  Stones of many colors and sizes compose the structures, revealing a hasty construction that probably met some past need.  Either flung wide open or snapped tightly shut, slatted shutters reflect the mixed mood of pedestrians progressing along the cobblestones."
