    "A freshwater stream courses toward the distant coast, passing by a stand of towering purple-bloomed rosewoods that are festooned with parasitic strangler figs.  The small river is continuously active with whirlpools and spillways emerging and receding with liquid rapidity.  One shallow channel remains constant, clear liquid flowing steadily over its downwardly stepped bed of partially submerged stones."
