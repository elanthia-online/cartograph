    "In an effort to keep the boggy surroundings at bay, planks of wood overlay the soggy ground and provide a mostly stable walking surface.  Pale blue-shaded lanterns hang at regular intervals along the support beams overhead, the flames behind the glass flickering fitfully from time to time.  Standing guard at either side of this area is a feminine blue aelotoi mannequin and a masculine grey aelotoi mannequin, while near the opening that leads further into the tent is a tiered oak jewelry display tucked to one side."
