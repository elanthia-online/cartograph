  "description": [
    "Well-tended lawns of silvery red moss cover much of the open expanse, radiating outward from a circular courtyard bordered by small boulders of polished black granite.  Ringing the outer perimeter, several stalagmites have been hewn into pedestals that support highly detailed statuary captured in poses of battle.  An immense invar portcullis, flanked by armored, dwarven guards on either side, serves as the entrance to a stark grey limestone edifice."
