    "Faceted chips of sphene and quartz have been inlaid across the walls and ceiling, creating a fanciful pattern of colors across the drab stone.  Heavy emerald green woolen curtains partition the lounge into several cozy nooks, replete with gem-inlaid settees and leather-cushioned chairs.  At the center of the room is a thick-legged bronzed metal table offering an array of food and refreshments."
