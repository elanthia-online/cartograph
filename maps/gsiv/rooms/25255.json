    "The ceiling is ravaged by a number of warped apertures that spill linear bands of sunlight over the tawny sandstone floor.  A broad squared hollow is worked into the inner wall, displaying choice pieces of ahdmir blue-glazed pottery.  In a tragic outcome, some of the artworks have been smashed to nothing more than a gritty dust."
