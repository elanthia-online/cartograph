  "description": [
    "Available seating is scant in this area of the stands, the hastily constructed benches of aspen planks cracked and splitting under the weight of the enormous crowds.  Tree stumps have been pushed up against the front of the stands, creating makeshift high chairs for flag-waving children.  Oblivious to the fanfare, an old shaggy dog snores quietly in a pile of sawdust in one corner."
