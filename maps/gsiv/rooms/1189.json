    "The Locksmehr River runs wider, deeper and slower here, allowing a ferry service to take passengers across to the opposite shore.  A weathered wooden dock, firmly lashed to several large pilings, juts out into the river.  To the west and north a deciduous forest basks in the moonlight, and no trails appear through the undergrowth.  Eastward the forest recedes somewhat from the rushing river, allowing passage along the bank.  Smoke curls lazily from the chimney of a nearby rustic cabin.",
