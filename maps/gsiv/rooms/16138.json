    "A young couple has spread a picnic blanket amidst the wildflowers sprinkled on the far bank.  She plays a soft melody on a silvery lute, while he roots around in the basket.  The stream curves to the west.  A small, wooden bridge allows travel to the north.  Moonlight reflects of the waters surface.",
