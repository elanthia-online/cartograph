  "description": [
    "The hallway ends abruptly, further passage blocked by the silken folds of long blue curtains and a couple stacks of crates that are pushed up against the walls.  A painting hangs on the western wall, its canvas covered with vibrant hues swirled together to form an image of a large kraken besieging a mariner's vessel.  The plush carpeting continues to the northern end of the corridor and underneath the curtains."
