    "Reeking of the sweet scent of chocolate, the small shop is warm and inviting.  Several upholstered chairs are set about the room, paired to tables with cloth for patrons to sample wares at in comfort.  The shelves are lined with the shop inventory and a large glass-topped counter displays several heaters for sale.  An archway leads out of the shop."
