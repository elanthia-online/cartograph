    "Tall potted palms lean gracefully over the carved, white railings.  At the top of the landing hangs a large oil painting of the town.  Bright silver and blue tapestried carpet runs the length of the hall, softening the patrons' footsteps.  A massive chandelier sways from silver chains, hanging low in order to light not only the landing, but the entry on the floor below."
