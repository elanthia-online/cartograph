  "description": [
    "A hazardous trail weaves down from the ledge in a helter-skelter pattern, defying gravity with every twist and turn.  Rocks make the way more difficult still, with a propensity for dislodging and tumbling down the slopes.  The cold adds a final contribution in the form of lacy hoar-frost, coating rocks and skree with a dangerous icing."
