    "Thatched walls surround this small room with a large opening set for the door and another for a window.  Growing across the latter are several layers of flower-laden vines that offer their sweet scent to the room.  The wooden floor is covered with a fine layer of pollen and flower petals, and a glass-topped wooden case rests in the center of the room.  Hanging from the thatched ceiling above is a woven vine net basket, its contents clearly visible through holes in the netting."
