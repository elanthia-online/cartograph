    "A long metal table lines the western and northern walls of this small chamber.  The bottles, alembics, tubes and jars upon it are jumbled together and covered with dust.  Strange symbols are etched on the ceiling and floor.  A mural painted on the eastern wall depicts a flight of dragons soaring through a twilight sky."
