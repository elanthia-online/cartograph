    "The floor is covered with a layer of tree bark, and the walls are painted with visions of sprouting leaves breaking away to blue sky and clouds.  A pair of jewelry trees rise up from the floor, each of their branch-like limbs displaying a number of items.  The only escapes from this arboreal mirage appear to be a sky blue silk drape and a white cotton curtain."
