    "This is the central area of the gnome mine.  A small stove burns low near the center of the room.  Near the stove, a pile of freshly mined ore is stacked neatly against a small forge.  Some furs are stacked in the northwestern corner near a large cask of water.  The tunnel to the southeast leads to a much larger cavern."
