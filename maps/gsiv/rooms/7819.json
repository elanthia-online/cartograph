    "You reach the summit of the hill and enter an alpine meadow.  The expanse of short grass suggests that a flock of shopai usually graze here, and indeed have grazed here recently, but the rich pasture is empty.  A crooked gray shack stands on one side of the meadow, barely more than a lean-to.  Shepherds should shelter there during this time of year, but it too is deserted."
