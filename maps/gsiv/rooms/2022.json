    "The trail doglegs back on itself, forced to turn where Greymist's trees grow so closely they are impenetrable.  Clouds of night fog move slowly through the buttress roots, cloaking them in an eerie, moonlit twilight.  Here and there, a few large palm leaves arc up through the fog, spreading knife-like fingers out from their central stems.  An overgrown trail snakes away from the main path, leading into the darkness.",
