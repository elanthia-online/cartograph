    "Various weaponry and armor are arrayed on racks throughout a wide room with vaulted windows of colored glass.  Demon and humanoid-shaped practice dummies await attacks from novices and veterans alike.  While the rest of the room contains signs of regular use, the central onyx-bordered circle is free of any clutter.  Tapestries hung between the windows depict military scenes in muted hues."
