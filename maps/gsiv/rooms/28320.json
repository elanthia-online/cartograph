  "description": [
    "A lush green hedgerow extends from either side of a scrollworked wrought-iron gate to enclose the limestone tiled courtyard.  Small potted fruit trees decorate the corners while flowering trumpet vines climb up a free-standing pergola which bears a plaque and shades a cushion-covered lounge.  Directly across from the structure, a low table and several brightly colored chairs beckons one to relax and listen to the burbling of the nearby hot spring."
