  "description": [
    "A large ivory-hued manor is situated amongst the lush farmland, its long arched windows shrouded by carmine curtains.  The gardens of the estate offer a plentiful bounty for the eye -- cultivated in an immaculate display of elegant beauty are collections of flaming violets interspersed with a deep black variety, while the tiny yellow buds of wood violets peek through the darker petals.  A white trellis arcs over the walkway that leads to the dark marble door, twined with lush, incarnadine roses."
