    "Torches held by wrought iron sconces hang evenly spaced on this room's continuous, circular wall.  The marble floor is polished to a superior sheen, which reflects the torchlight to further brighten the room.  In the exact center stands a low and wide marble platform, bearing the full weight of a large stone slab."
