    "Water crashes down from overhead and breaks over several crags jutting out from the face of the mountainside.  A cave mouth creates a dark roundish shadow peeking out from behind the curtain of cascading water, near an overgrown path leading back up the side of the steep gorge.  Heading east from the crystaline pool collecting at the base of the cliff, a cobblestone walk glimmers in the moonlight as it leads to the town common.",
