    "Parallel with the stone bulwark surrounding the town, the path continues to skirt the forest edge and dodges the occasional lone fir tree before petering out at the edge of the glacier.  Leaning at an angle and with a canted tip, a nearby snow-covered tree resembles a pointed hat tossed carelessly into a corner."
