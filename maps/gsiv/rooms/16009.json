    "Grey cobblestones meander beneath well-tended orange and peach trees.  Lining the path, brilliantly colored flowers perfume the night air with heavy scents.  Crickets chirp from their hiding places, and moths flutter aimlessly about.  Wooden steps climb to an enclosed porch attached to a two-story villa.",
    "Grey cobblestones meander beneath well-tended orange and peach trees.  Lining the path, brilliantly colored flowers perfume the air with heavy scents.  Birds sing in the branches above, and tiny butterflies flit from blossom to blossom with careless abandon.  Wooden steps climb to an enclosed porch attached to a two-story villa."
