    "Curving around a carved pillar, the var is lined with lanterns.  The cobblestone road leads past a set of ornate gates, with a beautifully manicured lawn visible beyond.  Meandering to a white marble building, a stone walkway is bordered by green shrubs, their thick branches creating a natural barrier."
