    "Wooden shelves droop beneath the weight of assorted goods all arranged in tidy rows.  In the center of the shop, a glass showcase holds a small selection of flatware, while the remainder of the merchandise is displayed on counters, on barrels, in crates, and miscellaneous other containers.  A tall ladder is available for reaching the upper shelving."
