    "In the center of the room is a large, triangular table surrounded by stools and other, taller chairs.  Broad banners proclaim the space as the shared property of the city militia and the Northern Fury, and enormous maps cover the rest of the walls.  Lining the floors are spacious lockers designed to hold weapons for the defense of Icemule Trace."
