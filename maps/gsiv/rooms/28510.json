    "Laying in the shadows of the island, the small clearing is dominated by mist and gloom.  Looping roots prevent light from falling upon the ascending pathway that climbs to the northeast, while large boulders rise like titans to shield the sea beyond.  Some past visitor has decorated the arboreal appendages of an enormous cocobolo tree with votives and tallows, but the insidious attention of the winds has robbed them of their flame."
