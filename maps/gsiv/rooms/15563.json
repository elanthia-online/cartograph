    "Forest green velvet covers a chair set next to the bed.  The bed is formed from white pine, greatly contrasting with the green covers that match the chair.  A small desk rests near the bed, a few pieces of paper and an ink well awaiting use upon it.  A raised tile dais serves as a home to a large marble tub."
