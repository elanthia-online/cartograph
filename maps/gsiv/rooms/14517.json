    "Slate stone walls open wide to reveal a massive, sprawling high-domed structure.  Two distinct paths separate at this point, one leading up a steep path and the other heading towards a grassy trail.  At the center of the fork is a tall post with two white-washed wooden arrows tacked to its top.  The west-facing arrow reads, \"Tropics Trail\" and the east-facing one is marked with the words, \"Exotic Outlands.\""
