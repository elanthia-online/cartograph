    "Octagonal lanterns hang from the tanik beams of the roof, illuminating the interior of the wagon.  Ink stains almost every surface imaginable, creating a colorful assortment of drips, drops, splatters, and in some places, doodles.  An ink-stained modwir desk, bolted to the floor, shows an assortment of books on its flat surface.  Mounted on the wall is a hammered mithril and ora bin, proudly displaying a number of tubes and cylinders."
