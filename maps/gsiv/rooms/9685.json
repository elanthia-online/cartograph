    "Decorating the patched canopy overhead are various images of extinct birds.  In the center of the shop, a glass counter, crafted to resemble the head of a raptor, holds an exotic multi-tiered jewelry stand on one end.  At the back of the shop, a life-sized statue of a multi-armed creature displays an assortment of trinkets.  Nestled between two tables, one holding figurines, and the other holding miscellaneous items, is a bejeweled tree."
