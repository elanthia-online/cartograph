    "Mews Lane ends at the foot of a flight of stone steps leading up to an imposing building, its front girthed by a generous porch stretching completely across it.  In its lee, the row houses reach their end, and an alley leads between them and the large edifice.  The path bordering Mews Lane turns the corner in back of the building, containing the Mews in its embrace."
