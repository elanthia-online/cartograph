    "This small cramped area appears to have once been the nest of some creature with very unsanitary housekeeping habits.  It's dark, it's damp, and it's smelly, and there is about the place a feeling of darkness that extends beyond the mere fact that there is little light here.  The glowing lichen on the walls grows in unusual, almost runic patterns."
