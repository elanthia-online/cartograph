    "At this pinnacle rise of the forest, the trees hold a steady ridge line, like sentries in a watchtower.  An escarpment leads down to a verdant meadow that was once an ancient river plain, indicating the Mistydeep was once much wider than it currently flows.  From this point, the shores of both island and mainland are solid dark black against a reflective and undulating indigo.",

From this point, the shores of both island and mainland are clearly visible, as is much of outlying community and water traffic."
