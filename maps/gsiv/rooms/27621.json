    "Poorly lit lamps offer very little illumination at the entrance of the necropolis.  A recent cave-in has destroyed a stone bridge leading deeper within the undercroft, completely blocking off access.  A ruined black ora altar is tipped over by the passageway leading up to the temple.  The only hope of further progress is a stone ledge overlooking a chasm cloaked in darkness, which a splotchy goblin miner guards."
