    "Polished woods and darkly-stained shelves warm the room with their rich hues.  An older journeyman sorts through a new shipment of separates and other apparel, placing each arrival on the correct shelf.",
    "Lengths of polished wood are spaced evenly across the floor of the shop.  Several tall, darkly stained shelves warm the room with their rich hues.  Positioned in front of the shelves is a stately oak desk with a small sign sitting on top of it.  A row of lit candelabras rest on either side of the shelves, illuminating their contents.  An older shopkeeper leans against a wide shelf, a welcoming smile on his face.",
    "Along the back wall of this room, an elegant gold-trimmed glass case bears several unique clothing designs, a small sign positioned neatly above it.  On each adjacent wall, several wide shelves stand evenly spaced, their contents folded in neat stacks.  Dancing light emanating from candelabras placed throughout the room illuminates the wares for sale.  A stately oak desk rests atop an ornate rug in the center of the room.  An older dwarven shopkeeper stands next to the desk, a welcoming smile on his face."
