    "The hull of the ship is painted in a brilliant swirl of colors.  Blues and greens flow into pale whites as the designs on the hull rise upwards.  Numerous colorful pillows rest in a large pile at the center of the floor.  Along the side of the hull is a wooden plank stairway that leads to a small balconied loft above."
