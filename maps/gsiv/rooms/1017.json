    "A dwarven outpost is located on this shelf carved into the rock mountain face.  Ragged tents line the edges of the outpost along the cliff and rock face.  A ramshackle tavern that sits just to the north has a faded wooden sign hanging unsteadily above its door.  The wind whips around the sides of the mountain, kicking up dirt and adding quite a chill to the air.  Diverse groups of travelers wander past, most likely just passing through on their way to another town."
