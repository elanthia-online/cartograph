    "Oak desks and chairs arranged neatly in groups fill the room.  A huge slate in the front dominates all, its surface still covered with chalk scrawls left from a previous day's lesson.  In the corner is a large basket filled with oversized scrolls, just beneath a large map of Elanthia hanging on the wall.  Along the window ledge sit seedlings of various herbs growing in small clay pots, each with a different student's name printed on its front."
