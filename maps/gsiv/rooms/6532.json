    "Granite cliffs tower overhead, their faces marked with a wealth of striations and their peaks bearded with slowly drifting clouds.  A small door is cut into the stone, with seams that are joined so cleverly they are almost invisible.  To the west, the escarpment meets an imposing castle perched against the protective rock, while a glassy lake stretches from its foot into the foggy distance."
