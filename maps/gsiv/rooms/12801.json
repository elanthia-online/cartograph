    "Framed in oak and set with a long tapestry rug, the corridor is lined with bookcases and bulletin boards that are filled with reading materials.  Standing opposite one another, with brass sconces to illuminate them, are a pair of matching doors fitted with slender brass plaques.  Further down the corridor are another set of doors, while to the south, a reception area can clearly be seen with its large desk set in the center."
