    "Fan palms stretch overhead, partially obscuring the aqua and verdant domed ceiling.  Steaming hot water cascades along a fall of riverstones, carefully pieced together to end in a natural stone pool.  Tiny square tiles in varying shades of greens, blues, greys and blacks form a swirling kaleidoscope across the floor."
