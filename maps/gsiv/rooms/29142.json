    "Knotty pine rafters are evenly spaced down the long hall, causing the ceiling to resemble the inverted ribs of a ship.  Starlight illuminates the panes of nearby windows, while lanterns crafted to look like tiny houses spill warm candlelight onto the mahogany floorboards.  Curving along the exterior wall, a set of descending stairs stands opposite a set of wide golden oak doors in the wide landing."
