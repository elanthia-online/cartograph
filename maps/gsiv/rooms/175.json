  "description": [
    "The base of the granite tower is nearly covered in a lush green carpet of creeping fig.  The tiny leaves provide a stark living contrast to the tower's impenetrable stony exterior.  North of the var, a flagstone walkway leads to the gatehouse of a compound enclosed by a curving, grey stone wall."
