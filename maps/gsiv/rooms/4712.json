    "Tall pines and firs spread their branches over the cobblestone road, covering it with mottled patches of sunlight and shade.  In many places the tree roots have disturbed the cobblestones, buckling what once may have been a smooth, evenly laid surface.  Despite the changes wrought by the area's fauna, and the erosion caused by natural forces, the roadway is in surprisingly good condition, a tribute to those who built it.",
