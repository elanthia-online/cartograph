    "Narrow trails lead through the dark woods in several directions, beneath the tangled arches of the trees that encroach on the twisting paths from all sides.  Clumps of deep green and brown moss dangle from the branches, hanging over the trail to brush at unwary hunters with their weblike tendrils."
