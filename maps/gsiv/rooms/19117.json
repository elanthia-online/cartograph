    "Garishly painted in a nightmare of orange and yellow, this cluttered and claustrophobic closet of a room is filled with an amazing conglomeration of puzzles, tricks and novelties.  A dented tin tub dangles from the ceiling, a badly frayed rope the only thing keeping it from plummeting to the floor.  On one wall, a small wooden shelf hangs between two flickering oil lanterns, each gathering filmy cobwebs that have turned grey with many layers of collected dust.",
