  "description": [
    "The chamber is cold, dark, and deathly quiet.  The thick earthen walls of this vault-like room muffle any sounds that might be coming from above or below.  What looks to have been a stairwell or door is now boarded up with thick planks of wood and heavily reinforced with sturdy bars of iron.  Intricate runes have been etched in an arc above the barrier."
