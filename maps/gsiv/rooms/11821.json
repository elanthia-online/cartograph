    "The road moves north and south between broken mounds of dirt and stone that mark out a boundary along the edges of two wide plazas on either side of the road.  Unusually straight cracks and an occasional gleam of grey peeping through the dirt indicates the presence of cracked granite blocks buried beneath the soil."
