  "description": [
    "Packed with stone benches, the stone steps leading to the back wall are framed by a bas-relief of a broken circlet full of shattered jewels.  The highwalk curves before the lowest seats, its view of the plaza and dais below obscured only by the occasional column supporting the walk's marble overhang."
