  "description": [
    "Though this section of the wall is relatively intact, deep fissures score the surface and the occasional gust of air whistles through.  A battered and bent brazier lies overturned on the floor, the links on its attached chain oddly warped.",
    "A small arch is marked out in chalk on the finished granite wall, and another of a slightly different shape is traced beside it as if the craftsman has not yet decided on a style.  A stubby piece of chalk rests discarded thoughtlessly on the floor.",
    "Chisel marks in the wall have begun to take shape as cusp-arched niches, and the floor underfoot is littered with fine dust and discarded shards of granite.  A pair of wood-handled chisels are left abandoned on a worktable along with dark leather flask.",
    "A pair of niches bite deep into the granite wall, their depths filled with an array of sundries artfully displayed on a hammered pewter charger.  Mismatched candlesticks topped with indigo candles set alongside the items offer fitful illumination as the candle flames flicker every few seconds, tickled by the fingers of unseen air currents.  Every breath pulls the chill of the air into the lungs along with the subtly sweet aroma of dogbane."
