  "description": [
    "Most of the visible coastline is unapproachable black rock rising straight up from the water, but a driftwood dock attached to a small strip of sea-level land provides an entrance to the island's interior: a narrow valley lushly green with dense tropical foliage.  A huge waterfall crashing down from a northern cliff is split by a jutting promontory, sending a smaller tributory rushing towards the valley.  Nestled under the smaller fall is a large glass house."
