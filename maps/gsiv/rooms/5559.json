  "description": [
    "This room is well lit by torches lining the walls in sconces.  Piles of furs and the shredded pieces of straw mattresses lie about the chamber, evidence that the cellar now serves as sleeping quarters for at least a score of beings.  A table and chairs stand in the center of the room, intact and apparently well used.  Just to the right of an ironbound door, a ladder set into the stone of the south wall leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling."
