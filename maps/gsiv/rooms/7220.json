    "Clammy, cold air caresses your skin, awakening goosebumps over any exposed flesh.  Spiderwebs tie the bones scattered across the floor together like delicate tendons, forming a collapsed parody of a complete skeleton.  Dust sifts out from between the grey stone blocks of the walls, telling a tale of age and instability in the architecture."
