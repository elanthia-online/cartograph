  "description": [
    "Curving subtly, the smooth limestone walls create a circular room fitted with tiny alcoves.  At the center of the room is a large, round sandstone table that is ringed by backless armchairs fashioned of embossed leather.  Shelf-lined walls glimpsed at the far end of the room bespeak storage shelves illuminated by grass lanterns, while moonlight can be seen trickling from beneath the ebon curtains adorning each alcove."
