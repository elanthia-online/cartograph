    "A trio-bladed mounted vellum fan hangs on one of the woven grass divider walls, and a billowing silk ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of wooden shoe lasts sits in one corner of a glazed bamboo floor.  There is an elegant silver jewelry rack on one side of the shop and a long mistwood counter on the other."
