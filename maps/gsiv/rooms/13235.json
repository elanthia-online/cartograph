    "Niches filled with flickering candles and tiny braziers releasing curls of incense smoke add to the solemn peace of this tiny chapel.  Dark rosewood benches contrast sharply with the surrounding pale walls.  A carved rose quartz catafalque stands at one end of the room, upon which sits a coffin adorned with deep red roses.  Hanging on the wall behind it is a magnificent Oleani tapestry."
