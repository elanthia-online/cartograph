    "The walls of this spacious workshop are set with panels of fine woods ranging from pale haon to richly toned ebonwoods, inset with a variety of patterns in jade and ivory to illustrate the skill of their craftsmen.  The elegantly clad dwarven artisan moves from table to table, a constant grumbling emanating from his squat, dark figure as he issues instructions to apprentices engaged in carving finely-made doors."
