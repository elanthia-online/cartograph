  "description": [
    "Walls of thin reeds tower and surround, giving way only to narrow, winding animal paths.  The once omnipresent fog is reduced to ground crawling white spectral tendrils that slowly slip over the earth.  From the northeast comes the sound of moving water, while from all other directions is nothing but the stillness of the fens broken intermittenly by the angry screams of local animal residents."
