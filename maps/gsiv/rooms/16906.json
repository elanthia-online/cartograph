    "Detailed maps of Zul Logoth's tunnels adorn the smooth grey stone walls that enclose this office.  A nondescript granite desk is covered with piles of paperwork and an empty silver stein.  Draped over a high-backed chair is a thick red wool coat, which contrasts strongly with the drab surroundings.  Several shelves along the back wall house a collection of polished rocks."
