    "Taking up most of the room in the booth, a white linen-covered table is arranged with a palette of paints and several different brushes.  Several different patterns are painted around the walls of the booth, ranging from a vibrant green vine to a red bird depiction.  The open-air construction of the booth allows the sweet fragrance of strawberries to drift inside."
