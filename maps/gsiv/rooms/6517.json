    "To the southwest, the forest has receded into a distant, impenetrable wall.  Around the road, however, prairie grasses have overtaken the forest's grip on the countryside, and they grow more lush the further one gets from the barrier of trees.  The road barely holds its ground, winding away through the golden verdure like a ribbon rippling in the wind."
