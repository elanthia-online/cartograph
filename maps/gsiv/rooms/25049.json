    "Thick wooden planks lay across the mud-filled trench separating the encampment from the main road, the pieces caked with red-tinged boot prints.  Splintered torches stab out from the ground, a few displaying a number of skeletons hanging skewered upon their jagged ends.  Off to the side of the trench are the remains of a winged beast, punctured by a number of steel-headed pikes."
