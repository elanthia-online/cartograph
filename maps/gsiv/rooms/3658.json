    "Somewhere nearby a nest of robins is alive with the cries of hungry young.  Awnings, in striped patterns of various shades, stand out from the whitewashed facades of the shops along the street.

Standing alone on one side of the street is an ornate stone building, its militant appearance a stark contrast to the colorful awnings across the way.
