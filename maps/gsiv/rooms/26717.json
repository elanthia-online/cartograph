    "A trio of shark-wrought scuppers loom unscathed above a collection of broken oars and pieces of shore boats, the oceanic predators gazing down at the wreckage with sharpened iron teeth.  Further exploration of the deck has been blocked by a barricade of metal and wood, the labyrinth concealing large shadows swimming deep within the cold waters."
