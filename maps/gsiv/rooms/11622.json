  "description": [
    "The old road wends it way in and out of the gnarled forest.  Saplings grow in the weedy row between the wagon ruts.  The faint odor of damp animal fur lingers in the air.  To the south is a well-trodden foot trail.  The ancient road runs primarily east and west, where it rapidly disappears into the mist."
