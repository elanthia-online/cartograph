    "This suite is tastefully decorated in rich shades of brown.  A golden brown couch runs the length of one wall, with two tables flanking it.  On each table sits a vase with flowers in it.  Numerous chairs are spread around the room to provide additional sitting space, making this a fine place for quiet conversation."
