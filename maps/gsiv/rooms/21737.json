    "Mushroom lanterns hung along the damp walls light this dark compact room, illuminating the crushed peanut shells littering the floor.  Pint-size mushroom stools are arranged alongside a squatty mithril bar.  Several shelves display a supply of liquor as a severed orc's head, mounted above an invar plaque, glares ominously at the jovial scene.  A fire crackles and pops from a roughly chiseled hole in the far wall, while a short tunnel leads up and out."
