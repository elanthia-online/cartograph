    "The tall pines standing majestically on either side of the path provide a thick canopy overhead, from which birdsong can be heard in a continuous chorus.  At the forest's foot, giant ferns cascade down the trail's embankments in a deep emerald drift of fronds.  An occasional patch of light winning through the layered branches dapples the trail, which twists and turns through the luxuriant foliation.",
