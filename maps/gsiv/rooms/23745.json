    "Wrapped in canvas and oilcloth, the wagon's roof is supported by enormous sea thrak ribs that are anchored to the low oak walls.  A pot-bellied cast iron stove is positioned in a corner behind a long modwir plank counter, its chimney rising between oak and canvas for ventilation.  Various copper pots, steel ladles, and cast iron pans are neatly arranged on hooks set into the back wall, and a copper-banded wooden barrel is set nearby."
