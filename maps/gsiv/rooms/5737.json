    "Crystals of salt glimmer beautifully within the cavern, illuminated in soft hues of white and blue by toadstools as tall as trees.  A pair of the luminescent fungi flank the entrance of a glistening salt bridge that crosses a dark canal on the north side of the brine lake.  The soft murmur of wind echoes through the stalactites, though there is no tangible breeze."
