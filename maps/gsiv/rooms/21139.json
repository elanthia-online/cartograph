    "Slight raised from the floor of the bar, the alcove is positioned beyond the yawning mouth of a stone-edged arch.  Bronze fixtures are fitted into the cobblestone walls providing the area, as well as the table and chairs, with ample illumination.  A scrap of paper has been hammered into the wall."
