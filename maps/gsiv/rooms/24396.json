  "description": [
    "The forest opens into a wide, moon-lit glade, the mossy ground crisscrossed by shifting patterns of green formed by the network of branches and vines above.  The glade opens a bit wider to the south, and turns into a thick copse of oaks to the west.  The heavy undergrowth at the southwest part of the glade barely hides the outlines of a rough wooden building of some sort."
