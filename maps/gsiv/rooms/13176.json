    "The veil of leaves above parts toward the outer edge of the grounds, flooding the grove with pure sunlight.  Nurtured by natural sustenance, a scattering of miniature lemon trees release an ambrosial citrus fragrance in the air.  The ends of a few branches are carefully pruned on an angle, a reverent gesture toward the Lady's plentiful gifts.",
