    "Cluttered with shelves along two blue stucco walls, the office is relatively neat and clean of debris.  Wide open windows in the western wall allow for the free flow of air in the humid room, while the archway facing the corridor provides a bit of a cross breeze.  Positioned catty-corner to one of the larger bookcases is a white metal lectern designed with wrought-iron filigree vines, while a cherrywood desk occupies the center of the room."
