    "The first floor of the northeast tower is a spacious study, yet small for a single room in a tower of this size.  A large slab of black slate has been framed in oak and fastened to the wall and used to display symbols and runes.  A few well worn tables and chairs are scattered about the room and some steep stairs spiral high up into the tower."
