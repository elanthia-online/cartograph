  "description": [
    "Scenes detailing the history of the Black Wolves Clan are proudly portrayed in magnificent oil paintings that line the walls.  The center of the ceiling houses a rounded crimson skylight that bears the silhouette of a howling wolf.  Moonlight penetrates the translucent image, casting the Black Wolves seal faintly onto the white marble floor below.  Bronze lanterns hang in pairs down the wide hallway, and a few armchairs have been arranged around a small table."
