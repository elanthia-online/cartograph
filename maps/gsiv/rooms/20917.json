    "Whether it is raining or not, occasional droplets of water fall from the trees above, splattering on the moist, leaf-covered ground below.  The sound of rushing water can be heard nearby, but no river or stream is apparent in the near vicinity.  A small clearing is visible in the foliage, but branches and vines make it impossible to tell where it leads."
