    "Several open-air cells are scattered throughout this room, along with several sets of shackles that are bolted to the cavern wall.  The area is free of debris and several large footprints are evident in the dirt floor.  The cell doors and shackles look to be in good condition but show no signs of recent use.  Two large iron hooks are set about five feet high along the north wall and hold several lengths of heavy chain."
