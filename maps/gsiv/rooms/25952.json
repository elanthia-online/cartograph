    "The flexible withes of a weeping willow droop down to the grass bordering the path to the north.  Within the protection of the leafy boughs, the glint of water can be seen reflecting the dapples of sunlight.  Deep croaking breaks the silence intermittently, indicating that the small pond houses at least one frog."
