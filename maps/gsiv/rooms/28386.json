    "A brightly polished platinum orb dotted with tiny star-shaped holes hangs above the table, and thin rays of light spear outward from it as it lazily spins back and forth.  Every so often, a ray strikes one of the hundreds of tiny crystals that decorate the smooth black tabletop, creating a momentary rainbow that pleases the eye."
