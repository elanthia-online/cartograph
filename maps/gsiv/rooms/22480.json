    "Walls of roughly-hewn pine are lashed together with random bits of twine to form the interior of this broken-down shack.  A shaky-looking rack sits in the middle of the room, next to a long table covered in multiple nicks and dents.  A small counter crafted from multiple sized twigs sits at an awkward angle in the corner, oddly covered in a vivid purple doily."
