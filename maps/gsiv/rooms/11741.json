    "The southern lip of the half-dome ends above and the ceiling of the chamber seamlessly meets the top of a massive iron door.  Set between the door and five burning torches on the northside of the chamber is a large stone altar, atop which lies a skeleton impaled through the chest by metal spear.  The dark sockets of the skeleton's skull gazes silently at the metal door while its boney hands grasp the spear by its haft above its chest."
