    "The field opens into an expanse of grass in shades of green and brown, clear of rocks and trees and home to a flock of scrawny wild rolton that carefully keep their distance from wandering hunters as they graze.  A steady wind blows down from the higher moors to the east, bringing a slight chill to the air.",
