    "Glossy, oversized leaves sprout from the side of the thick-trunked tree at wide intervals, creating a stairway between the jungle floor and a platform above.  Moss-covered vines provide much-needed yet slippery assistance to cross the wide gaps.  Lush vegetation from the jungle floor reaches up toward you, including one particularly large pitcher plant."
