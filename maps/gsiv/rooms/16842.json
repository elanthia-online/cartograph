  "description": [
    "In an attempt to maximize productivity, the steam generated by a blackened iron furnace powers several mills through a series of wheels and gears.  Sweat drips down the faces of dwarves tending to the furnace's fire, though distance does little to lessen the intensity of its heat.  Tall steel hoppers are kept filled with malt from the north, in preparation to be milled.  A series of grist cases house the already milled grain."
