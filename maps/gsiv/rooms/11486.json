    "The high stucco wall forms a right angle, creating a sort of yard.  A very old and very tattered straw archery butt is set back away from the wall.  The target is nearly hidden by the tall grasses that sway as the breeze swirls around the area.  Maelstrom Bay is visible beyond the reef to the south."
