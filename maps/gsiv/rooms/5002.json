    "A large, flat boulder rests half-buried in the loamy ground, its surface covered with moss that is worn away in many places as if it has been used as a resting place over time.  A faint breeze wafts through from the east, bringing a faint whiff of something burning somewhere that blends with the forest scents of cedar and decaying leaves."
