    "Polished black marble peeks out from beneath the edges of a richly appointed ivory velvet carpet which stretches down the expanse of the hall.  A trio of elegant beeswax candles impressed with tiny seashells sits upon a lilac wood shelf, and a single window at the far end of the hall lets in sunlight and an ever-present, albeit faint, hint of an ocean breeze and salty air."
