    "Large dunes of snow rise and fall across the field as a brisk wind rustles through the icy banks, sending glistening snowflakes floating about.  A number of old and weathered wagons lie scattered about the grounds, each one draped with a layer of frost.  The wooden remains of a battering ram barely peek out from a huge snow drift."
