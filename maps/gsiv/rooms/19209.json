    "[The Magic Tart, Bakery]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A battery of white-clad halfling bakers mans the wide oven that crouches against the back wall.   Each possesses a wood-handled, wide spatula which they use to retrieve trays of tarts from the warm depths of the oven.  Curious children tug on the harried halflings' tunics, asking an enormous array of questions regarding tart ingredients, magic, ship-building, and bakery headgear."
