    "Blue tapestries adorn the walls here, each depicting an underwater ocean scene.  Coral sconces hang at even intervals between the tapestries, casting a warm glow over the room.  A row of cushioned chairs stands before large sea glass-framed mirrors, each paired with a small green glass table.  Upon each table rests a canister full of hair styling tools, bathing in blue liquid.  Behind an aqua silk screen at the back of the room are several padded tables meant for massages."
