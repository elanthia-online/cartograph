    "Two guardsmen, jeddart-axes at the ready, stand just within the blackened mithril gates of a towering, grey stone wall surrounding an elaborate garden.  Inside the wall, a large inner courtyard surrounds a central fishing pond overlooked by a guard tower flying a black flag.  A tall, finely detailed statue forms the center of a fountain that rises out of the pond to dominate the courtyard.  A cobbled pathway leads up to a massive structure with multiple pillars and some dark steel doors."
