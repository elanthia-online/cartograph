    "The local inn is a homey and cheery place with low, broad eaves and two round dormer windows overlooking the street.  The windows are shuttered now, but you can see some candlelight through the slats.  Smoke curls upward from the stone chimney, and the sounds of merriment drift out from a small window that seems to be in the pub."
