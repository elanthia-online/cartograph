    "Suits of polished armor stand at attention holding massive battle-axes in opposite corners of the quaint shop.  Gold stand-lamps are strategically placed to provide adequate lighting for the various items on display.  Mounted on the wall behind a massively carved desk is the head of a greater boar.  Closed and locked bejeweled chests flank both sides of the counter.  On the other side of the room are several rows of shelves each containing trophies cast from gold and silver in various shapes and sizes."
