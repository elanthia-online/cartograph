    "A larger-than-life wooden statue of a snarling manticore stands on a block of stone by the side of the lane, overseeing the passing wagons and playing children as they go by.  Patches of grass and flowering weeds grow along the dirt thoroughfare, and the various odors of cooking and firewood fill the air."
