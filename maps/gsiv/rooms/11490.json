  "description": [
    "Scrub grass and patches of thin, reedy weeds grow in the sandy soil.  To the north is a gully, at the bottom of which is a salt marsh.  Beyond the gully a hilly moor stretches off to the mist-shrouded horizon.  Behind the high stucco wall on the southern side of the pathway stands a tall, damaged tower."
