    "Sumptuous lengths of fur and swathes of velvet cloak the stone walls, insulating the room from stray drafts and giving it an indefinable air of luxury.  Brilliantly woven carpets cover the floor, stacked several layers deep and weighted down by row upon row of strongboxes and coffers.  Clear, golden light illuminates the room, cast by an elaborate chandelier mounted high overhead."
