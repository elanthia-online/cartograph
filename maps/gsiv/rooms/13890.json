  "description": [
    "The Gullet turns sharply, its contortion made more pronounced by the wealth of carving upon it.  The patterns collide in an echo of waves bludgeoning against rocks on a rugged shore.  The floor is remarkable, a rich mosaic composed of colored stones, which portray an ocean floor.  The subject is startling in its incongruity with the caverns hewn deeply within the granite cliffs, yet they are breathtaking in combination with the mystery and movement imbued in the carved walls."
