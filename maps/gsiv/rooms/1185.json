    "Down on the river, a mother bear and her two cubs move through the small pools present at the edge of the river's flow.  The cubs frolic in the cool water, batting at each other and splashing about.  A bit further upstream, the mother hunts in the bright moonlight, reaching down into a pool to slap at a fish.  Occasionally her attempts are successful, and a fish flies up onto the shore where it lays wiggling and struggling until the cubs, called by their mother, pounce on it and devour it with relish.",
