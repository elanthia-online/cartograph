    "The ground trembles as horses charge across the arena behind the market, causing the occasional clay pot or glass jar to roll across one of the makeshift counters in front of the shops.  Elongated replica lances and gaudy renditions of shields lay against the back wall of the markets, each one depicting the image of a phoenix painted in vermilion and black."
