    "Hanging limply, a tattered and faded blue flag is affixed to a long, corroded, steel pole mounted at the very stern of the sunken ship.  To the north, a stairwell spans from the middle of the forecastle into a large arcade, once filled with merchants and wares.  Built around the entrance to the stairwell, a cantilevered balcony overlooks the expanse of the Wavedancer's waterlogged main deck."
