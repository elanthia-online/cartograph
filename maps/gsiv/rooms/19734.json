  "description": [
    "Red brick walls heavily covered in thick tendrils of dark green ivy block passage to the east and west.  To the north a shining silver portcullis intrudes on the expanse of wall, flanked by brightly burning sconces.  Here and there throughout the courtyard small trees stand in simple brick planters, and stone animals peer out shyly from behind them.  The courtyard extends a few yards to the south, dropping sharply away to present a view of the rest of the Guild."
