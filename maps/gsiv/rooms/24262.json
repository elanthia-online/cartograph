    "An oil-filled brass sconce hangs on one of the white-washed ash walls, and a basket-woven golden bamboo ceiling rises overhead.  A brilliant red hibiscus plant sits in one corner of a sweet-scented rush-covered floor.  There is a large white wicker counter on one side of the shop and a large white wicker basket on the other."
