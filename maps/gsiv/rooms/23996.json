    "This spacious pavilion is walled in panels of the various House colors of the Elven Nations.  Sunlight passing through the panels casts the contents of a modwir cloak rack and some free-standing shelves near them in altered shades, but the pavilion's pure white roof renders the interior even brighter than outside.  Away from the walls, the hues of the wares on a small brass table and an oaken garment rack are more vibrant and alive."
