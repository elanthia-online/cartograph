    "A three-legged easel has been set up on the sedge green grass to the north of the pathway.  The canvas on the easel reflects the green, tan and hazy purple colors of the surrounding landscape.  Glimpses of brilliantly colored flowers can be seen to the west, but only the tiny purple heads of lavender plants lend their color and clean scent to the immediate area."
