  "description": [
    "Loud scratching noises emanate from the ceiling, and tree limbs can be seen swaying in the wind through the missing portions of the structure's covered roof.  A cold breeze howls as it swirls continuously through the length of the bridge, causing the thick layers of spiderwebs along the windows and in the corners to ripple.  The walls are coated with a slimy layer of moisture, and are disturbed only by the skittering insects that wriggle from one dark hiding place to another."
