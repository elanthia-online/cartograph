    "Occasional blasts of frigid air send clouds of white vapor all around this small room.  A stone-rimmed pool of ice water is dimly illuminated by a flickering torch on the far wall and stone steps lead down into the frigid depths of the incredibly deep crystal clear liquid.  Just the thought of plunging into the icy depths would test the stiffness of anyone's spine!"
