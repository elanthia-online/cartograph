    "Six long tables flanked by benches span the length of the room, and the heavy aroma of roasted meat and vegetables permeates the air.  A large sideboard boasts an impressive array of foods and desserts, as well as a rhimar ice bucket containing the chilled beverages.  Hanging on the farthest wall are two paintings.  A pair of large double doors lead out to the courtyard."
