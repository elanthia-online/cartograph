    "The path curves like a serpent, the smooth half-hidden stones in it forming a stippled pattern of brown, ochre and grey.  Ferns crowd the edges, sending their furred ivory runners snaking across the trail's way as if seeking an embrace.  The crisp, sweet smell of the pines creates a tranquil perfume punctuated by the clean smell of the loamy soil."
