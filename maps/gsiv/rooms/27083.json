    "Verdant succulents and feather-topped moss join beneath the shelter of the surrounding trees to create a thick carpet of patchwork green hues that completely covers the footpath.  Untouched by the lush growth, nine stones are arranged in a circle upon the nearby outcropping.  Tiny vines mask the details of a tarnished silver plaque that is perched upon a decorative stone."
