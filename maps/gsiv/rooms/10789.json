    "Knobby, moss-coated protrusions of pale granite emerge from the leaf-covered undergrowth, appearing like small helmeted soldiers hiding to ambush unwary trespassers.  A thick coating of damp moss caps each stone, providing camouflage within the broad ferns and wispy tendrils of the forest floor.  Although apparently harmless, the granite outcroppings and exposed roots which infest the run could pose problems for those travelers who do not keep a keen eye on their steps.",
