    "A line of blanket-draped, polished mahogany deck chairs await guests along the railing, some turned inward to facilitate conversation with fellow passengers, others turned outward, providing a view of the vast expanse of open seas.  Waves lapping against the hull of the large vessel provide a rhythmic accompaniment to the whistle of nightime winds through the sails and the muted chatter of ship-bound guests.",
