  "description": [
    "The trees close in tightly along the wide road.  Their branches intertwine above to form a coniferous canopy that filters the light and supports sheets of snow.  The wary traveler keeps an eye up as well as forward lest a sheet of snow suddenly become a wet blanket.  Although the forest is thick, the road is totally free of encroaching plants and seedlings, and its depth, slightly below that of the surrounding forest, suggests that the road has been in use for quite a long time."
