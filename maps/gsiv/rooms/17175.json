    "Windows strung with beaded crystals cast a myriad of rainbows on light haon walls.  Sheer iridescent panels of silk block off the soft white featherbed centered in the room.  Window seats padded with white puma hide covered cushions afford views of the leafy treetops, perfect perches from which to read tomes.  On a small table, several flickering candles give off a soft glow and the faint scent of jasmine."
