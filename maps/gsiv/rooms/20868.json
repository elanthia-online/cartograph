    "Servants bustle about this crowded kitchen, covered in flour, sugar, blood from the huge sides of meat roasting, and other ingredients.  Heat from the huge ovens fills the room, as do the wonderful scents of the meals the cooks are preparing.  Trays of pastries and platters of meat sit on a shelf near the door, just waiting for someone to carry them to their destination."
