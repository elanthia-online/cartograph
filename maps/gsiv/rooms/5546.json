    "A pair of large wooden tubs, one taller than the other, and a large copper boiler take up most of this room.  Mold grows in patches on the floor and walls as well as floor joists of the room above.  Either the ceiling in this room was never plastered, or the plaster has all fallen and become part of the uneven, mold-covered floor."
