    "Fog swirls and eddies about an apple tree planted where the fence changes course from east and west to northeast and southwest.  Several logs have been neatly piled near the base of the tree, stacked to form a sort of pyramid.  Opposite the tree is a single trunk, a rusted axe embedded into its surface."
