    "Tall evergreens grow thick throughout the area, letting almost no light through the verdant roof above.  Smaller broad-leafed trees, entwined by a variety of blooming vines, fill in the gaps between the larger trees, effectively locking in moisture and heat.  Occasionally, a few silvery gibbons swing overhead from limb to limb, ferrying themselves over a rushing river with hanging vines.  In the distance, the lively chatter and screeches of jungle life creates a cacophony of sound."
