    "Cedar shavings, strewn haphazardly around a raised square ring in the center of the hall, fail to mask the lingering odor of stale sweat, smoke, and whiskey that hangs in the air.  Several padded bags, roughly humanoid in shape, are suspended from a long wall near a crooked equipment rack.  In one darkened corner, bawdy patrons congregate around a low table surrounded by mismatched chairs, while some others crowd around an iron-banded keg, spiritedly demonstrating advanced jabs, kicks, and punches."
