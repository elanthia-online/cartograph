  "description": [
    "Round and low, a small table rests upon a carpet in the center of the floor and is surrounded by plump cushions of plum, indigo, and silver.  Trinkets, totems, and charms dangle from twine in the ceiling, their smooth faces glittering in the ambient light provided by votives housed in niches within the surrounded granite walls.  The spicy scent of sandalwood and myrrh fills the air, while a coin-edged velvet curtain muffles sound from the showroom beyond."
