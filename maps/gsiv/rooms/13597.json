    "A gold and crimson wyvern tapestry hangs on one of the textured red silk walls, and an elegantly arched fel ceiling rises overhead.  A suit of golden armor sits in one corner of a glossy black ebonwood floor.  There is a gold-veined black marble counter on one side of the shop and an intricately carved ebonwood stand on the other."
