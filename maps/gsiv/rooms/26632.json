  "description": [
    "This space, while extremely tight, is nearly spherical and looks to have been scooped out with great care.  The sticky-looking sand walls of the enclosure are barely visible in what little light seeps through a large crack.  Periodically, roils of creeping, silvery mist seep out of the walls and blanket the area, their thick tendrils pooling on the ground and clinging desperately to anything that touches them.  A handful of broken chairs, partly sunken into the sand, are available for seating."
