    "A white sprinkle of lilies of the valley covers the marshy ground here.  A few stark-white birch trees grow nearby.  The soil is so soggy that you can't help but get a bit wet as you make your way forth.  Someone has had the forethought to place a few planks across a particularly foreboding area."
