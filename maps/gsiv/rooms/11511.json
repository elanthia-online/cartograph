    "The blue riverstone lintel of the small window has toppled onto the floor, leaving an ugly crack in the grey slate tiles.  The once comfortable settee and the overstuffed chair have become a nesting site for rodents and vermin.  The bronze dolphin-shaped oil lamps suspended from the ceiling are enshrouded in cobwebs.  The breeze through the open window carries the scent of saltwater."
