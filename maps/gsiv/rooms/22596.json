    "A soft golden glow suffuses the room from a set of glowing orbs that hangs suspended from the angled ceiling.  The walls billow slightly in the passing breezes outside, causing the golden light to create varied shadows on the black silk surfaces.  An armoire in the far corner contains several drawers full of women's clothing, while a long marble counter in the center of the room displays several styles of footwear and a propped-up, discreet white wooden sign."
