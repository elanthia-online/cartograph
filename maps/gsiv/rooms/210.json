    "The facade of the Sylvarrglin Moving Company stands beside the cobbled wey, its grey-blue stone exterior worn smooth by the elements.  Twin torches burn brightly at either side of the structure, casting dim circles of light on the wey.  A city guardsman, ever watchful for signs of trouble, stand at attention on either side of the door."
