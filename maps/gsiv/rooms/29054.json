  "description": [
    "Brambles and briars stretch along the eastern edges of the animal track, the spindly arms and thick thorns snagging on anything that passes too closely.  Tall grasses give way to saplings that are surrounded by white-veined horehound and wild thistle with bright purple crowns.  Distantly, the sound of a babbling brook trickles in."
