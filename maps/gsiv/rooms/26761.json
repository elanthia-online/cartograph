  "description": [
    "Dark-lined woodland scenes sweep over the paneled walls of the small recessed area, the gilded glow of flickering tealights housed in green amber lanterns adding warmth to the nook.  A sprawling rabbit fur and doeskin rug is draped over the center of the floor, and soft essences of acantha and lavender float lightly in the surrounding atmosphere."
