    "Numerous city dwellers wander to and from the northern section of the court, where Wyvern Keep sprawls nearly to the edge of the cobblestoned wey.

    "Numerous city dwellers wander to and from the northern section of the court, where Wyvern Keep sits up against the edge of the cobblestoned wey and stands tall above all nearby buildings.  A statue of Vaalorian soldiers stands sentinel in the center of the wey, with a number of guards standing around it, each diligently eyeing the crowd."
