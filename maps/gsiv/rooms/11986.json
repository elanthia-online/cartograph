    "Disordered piles of huge granite blocks lie strewn down the side of the hill, making navigation below the tower challenging at best.  The western side of the hill drops down into a sheer granite cliff that butts directly up against the city wall.  A narrow path along the edge of the hill leads to the north and back eastward toward the center of the city."
