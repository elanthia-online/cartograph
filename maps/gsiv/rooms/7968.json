    "A huge glyph-covered slab, with a potion cabinet at one end, dominates the center of this room.  The temperature here feels slightly warmer than the rest of the cottage.  A faint scent of ozone lingers in the air about you, and a slight tingling sensation occasionally travels across your skin.  Scrolls, and other miscellaneous items, lay scattered about the workshop."
