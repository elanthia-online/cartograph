    "This simple living room looks both comfortable and inviting.  A large oak table sits at its center, surrounded by a couch and two chairs.  The furniture is covered with fine, tanned leather and plush, white puma fur cushions.  Several lamps on the walls provide a soft, ambient lighting to the room.  A stone archway frames a small courtyard outside, and a narrow hallway leads off in the opposite direction."
