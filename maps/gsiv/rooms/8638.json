    "This corner of the courtyard lies within the shadows of the surrounding buildings, creating a cool haven.  A large wooden bench painted with a vibrant mural sits before the six-tiered fountain that squats in the middle of the courtyard.  A flock of pigeons scavenge about for crumbs and seeds, their dun colored heads bobbing as they walk."
