  "description": [
    "A massive golden sun is inlaid upon the ceiling, its wavy stylized flames radiating outwards in a beautiful pattern.  Droplets of water occasionally drip down from the rounded gleaming design, disappearing in a sharp hiss as they land upon a small pile of heated rocks in the center of the room.  Dark ash benches are stacked against the walls, each enshrouded by a hazy steam that pervades the chamber with its muggy heat."
