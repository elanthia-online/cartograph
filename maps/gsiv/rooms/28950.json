  "description": [
    "Guests dine and carouse in close company at a single long table in this airy, well-appointed tavern.  Towards the corner, a collection of smaller tables allow guests to share a drink or word with a greater measure of privacy, and a small archway leads to a busy kitchen.  Large open windows dominate the tavern's southern wall, filling the space with the sights and sounds of the nearby sea."
