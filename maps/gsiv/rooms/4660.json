  "description": [
    "Water flows down over the rockface, creating small puddles that either need to be stepped over or crossed through to enter the cave mouth.  Echoes from the waterfall bounce against the walls of this grotto.  Small holes serve as natural sconces for several burning mullein torches, their flickering light creating dancing shadows along the surface and revealing a narrow opening to the north."
