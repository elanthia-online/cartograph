    "The manor opens up into a large circular chamber with a high glass dome ceiling.  A dark ironwood tree rises up from the center of the room, its branches bathed in moonlight from above.  Finely dressed servants bustle between a mahogany archway and a long hallway, while a wide stairwell ascends to the second floor."
