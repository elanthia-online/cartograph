    "An open grassy field has been painted in panorama upon the walls of the wagon's front section.  Rendered along the perimeter are the blue-grey waters of a wide moat, with small hummocks in the background and a distant, dark forest.  A threadbare curtain embroidered with a ruined drawbridge hangs to the north."
