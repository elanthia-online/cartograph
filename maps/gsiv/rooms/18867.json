    "Warm colored light shines through stained glass windows set in the tall circular walls.  Fragrant trails of incense linger with the smoke from an eight-candle chandelier.  A magnificent shrine to the goddess Lorminstra dominates the center of the room, her statue standing with hands outstretched to meet the fallen.  A snifter of fine cognac rests on a rosewood desk near the shrine.  Standing at the back of the room is a regal four-posted bed.  A sense of warmth, peace and order gently surrounds you."
