  "description": [
    "The maws of a number of tunnels open into a large, central chamber, its ceiling high above the jumble of boulders crowding its floor.  Large rib bones extend up out of the mist covering the debris, like ragged and curved picket fences.  The bleached white tones of skulls and bits of other bones occasionally peek through the blanket of fog as it shifts and eddies in the gloom."
