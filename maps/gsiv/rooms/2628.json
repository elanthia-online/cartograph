    "Mountains rise on either side of you, black peaks reaching for an angry red sky.  The ground beneath your feet is broken and rocky, making you stumble uncomfortably.  On the western side of the path stands a skeleton at least thirty feet tall.  His bony hands clutch a staff from which hangs a lantern, filled with odd stones that glow in the dim light.  The ripped remains of a black robe hang from the bones, fluttering in a slight breeze."
