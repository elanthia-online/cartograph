    "A large square in the center of the alabaster floor has been removed and replaced with a sand-filled pit, its edges carefully delineated with a single course of carved masonry.  Save for a border of open space around the practice area, the rest of the chamber is a maze of weapon racks and armor-laden mannequins.  An alabaster arch faces off across the room against an arched doorway, which leads eastward."
