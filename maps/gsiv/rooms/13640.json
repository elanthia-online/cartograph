    "Smooth gold-washed birch walls climb to the lofty, planked ceiling, a creamy tile floor spanning the distance between.  A set of spiraling mithril hooks and a heavy copper-traced counter are placed near the store's entrance, with wares neatly displayed upon them, and a vivid gold silk sunburst tapestry is tacked directly above.  Conquering one corner is a lush verdant cinquefoil plant, its blossoms adding a burst of color to the surroundings."
