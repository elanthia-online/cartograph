  "description": [
    "The road is barely a raised area of drier mud above a flat area of oozing mud and monotonous swamp grass.  Here and there part of a cobblestone protrudes up through the mud, often at an angle completely different from that which the builders intended.  The buzzing of the swamp insects seems to swell and abate in unison but without any discernible regularity, as though the insects know the tune though it follows no known meter."
