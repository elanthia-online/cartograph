    "The red and orange tiles from the west give way to a mix of black and ivory diamond patterns, leading up to a dark fel bar along the eastern end.  Colorful tapestries line the perimeter of the room, covering the walls in a wash of yellow, orange and green.  Sprouting from between the wall hangings at regular intervals are tall red candles in copper sconces, while a pair of large braziers hang from the ceiling, dispensing an overbearing musky odor into the air."
