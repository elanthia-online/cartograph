  "description": [
    "Cold iron manacles gleam dully, the color of rain, against the far wall of this small cell -- their tantalizing reach preciously few inches too short for a bid to freedom.  The oppressive nature of the dark stone walls causes hope to dwindle in the captives who must survive here, whittling away until it is a small spark, an ember whose fate is decided for good or ill by the wind."
