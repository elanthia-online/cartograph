    "The hallway continues on, thin and cramped, made even more so by the wall of mannequin legs that jut out into the path.  Bent and raised as if poised for a dancer's kick-step, the legs are dark and stained, a fact that cannot be hidden by the wares upon them.  The hallway makes a sharp turn to the north here, preceded by a fraying carpet runner."
