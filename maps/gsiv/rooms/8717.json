    "This store is fragrant with the mouthwatering smell of fresh-baked bread.  Long, flat loaves of gnollish lichen bread cool on racks behind the tidy counter.  On wooden shelves lined with parchment beside the counter are spicy muffins filled with berries and nuts, and cookies frosted with designs of elves, gnolls and sprites.  The jolly baker, in an immaculate white apron, beams at you while you try to decide on your selection.",
    "Ceramic tiles with elegant floral and fruit designs painted in bright hues form a mid-wall ring around the quaint shop.  A glass display counter showcases a wide variety of freshly baked treats, from tarts and cupcakes to pies and loaves of bread, their contents lined up neatly for easy selection.  An oak-framed window decorated with white lace curtains offers an ample view of the square."
