  "description": [
    "The chamber is shaped like a crescent moon, and within the curve of the arms, cascading tiers of steps lead down to arches opening into the auditorium beyond.  Heavy velvet drapes and thick rugs, all a rich shade of dark crimson, give the room a hushed ambiance, rendering footsteps almost soundless and conversation into a muted buzz."
