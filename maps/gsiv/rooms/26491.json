  "description": [
    "Trailed along the railing of the mezzanine is a dark green-leafed vine, laden with clusters of coral honeysuckle blossoms, their deep crimson coloring stark against the grey of the stone.  The ambient noise of the tavern is but a whisper here, largely muted beneath the hushed roar of crashing waves.  In the distance, the note of a ship's bell tolls, though its source is lost within the mists shrouding the sea."
