    "The stream continues its slow progress, meandering around towering firs and creeping under razor-sharp brambles while encouraging the swarms of voracious insects.  The conditions are intensified by the smothering humidity and lack of light.  One might be able to fend off the insects if one could only see them.  A lone boot, the top and a few laces visible, protrudes up through the mud.",
