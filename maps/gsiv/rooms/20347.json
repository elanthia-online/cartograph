    "The peat in most of this spot has been trampled away, exposing the sand and limestone beneath.  In one direction, however, the reeds and grass grow taller, and a narrow passageway leads through their arching verdancy.  At the edge of the black water, a large, heavily charred stump is nearly obscured by the moss hanging from the black gum tree branches overhead.  In comparison, not a single strand of moss drapes over the black ash trees that dot both land and water."
