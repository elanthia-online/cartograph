  "description": [
    "Overhead, the edge of one of the high rock walls has crumbled, sending a large pile of boulders down into the pass.  Contrasting round and jagged edges protrude from the conglomeration of rock, effectively barring the pass from further movement to the south.  Strangely, a few shallow indentations have been cut into the rock, perhaps as an aid to those who might wish to climb them."
