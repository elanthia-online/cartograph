  "description": [
    "Fully open to the stairs, the tidy bedroom serves as both sleeping quarters and an artisan's crafting space.  While the right half of the room is filled with a small bed, a plain footlocker, and a simple armoire, the left is almost cluttered with a floor-to-ceiling bookcase that houses several porcelain pieces of artwork, various painting jars, and a collection of paintbrushes.  An easel, its canvas splattered with paint, sits in a lone corner and has a nest of frosted glass globes suspended over it."
