    "A polished steel axe with a burnished modwir hilt has been embedded into the palace wall, scrawled red runes painted on its side.  Carrion birds are perched high on the palace roof above, glaring down at the small animal carcasses that have been tossed haphazardly about the path, left to rot and decay."
