    "A large stone fountain surrounded by a shimmering pool forms the center of the circle, carved of pinkish-grey granite into an elaborate sculpture of a band of wildcats gracefully bringing down an unfortunate velnalin.  Spring water gurgles merrily from the top of the fountain, filling the air with a fresh, moist scent and feeding the beds of snapdragons and lilies that grow around the pool.",

Spring water gurgles merrily from the top of the fountain, filling the quiet night air with a fresh, moist scent and feeding the beds of snapdragons and lilies that grow around the pool."
