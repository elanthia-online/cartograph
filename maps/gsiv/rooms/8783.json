    "A large stone fountain surrounded by a shimmering pool forms the center of the circle, carved of pinkish-grey granite into an elaborate sculpture of a band of wildcats gracefully bringing down an unfortunate velnalin.  Spring water gurgles merrily from the top of the fountain, filling the air with a fresh, moist scent and feeding the beds of snapdragons and lilies that grow around the pool.",
    "A large stone fountain surrounded by a dark, shimmering pool forms the center of the circle, carved of pinkish-grey granite into an elaborate sculpture of a band of wildcats gracefully bringing down an unfortunate velnalin.  Spring water gurgles merrily from the top of the fountain, filling the quiet night air with a fresh, moist scent and feeding the beds of snapdragons and lilies that grow around the pool."
