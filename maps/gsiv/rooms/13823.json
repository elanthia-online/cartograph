  "description": [
    "The broad sweep of the rough dirt floor is interrupted by a thread-bare woolen rug.  Halfway to the pine rafter ceiling, a iron-hooked split oak oar hangs on one of the tar-splotched pine walls.  A brass treasure chest and a plain wooden table are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
