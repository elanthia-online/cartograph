    "An expansive stand of armor and weaponry dominates this area of the market, the display barely concealing a makeshift forge further back from the crowds.  The sound of metal-on-metal clangs loudly through the air, the rhythmic echo followed by a shower of red-orange sparks that fade as quickly as they appear."
