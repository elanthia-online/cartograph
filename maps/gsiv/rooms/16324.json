    "Dark bamboo tables and chairs sit on the reddish tile flooring that rises up into stucco walls of white.  Dangling from hooks set in the stucco, wrought iron lanterns supplement the natural light streaming through several windows to amply illume the showcase of dyes.  Tiny bottles sit on shelves along the walls, and swatches of fabric lay across the tables.  Several garments, expertly dyed in intricately colored patterns, dress up the walls above the shelves."
