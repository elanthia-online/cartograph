    "Thick sky blue wool lines the interior of the roomy tent.  Several candles are perched on rounded wooden candleholders, their pillars carved with a series of tiny rabbits, chipmunks, and raccoons.  Colorful quilts are stacked near a pile of blue fleece pillows that are heaped to one side.  Crafted to be close to the ground is a small aspen table, its surface sanded and varnished for a smooth gleaming finish."
