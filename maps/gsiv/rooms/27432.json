  "description": [
    "The sound of a roaring bonfire and the loud din of various conversations filter in from a weed-filled dirt path.  Large signs, once gaily painted but now suffering from time and element, all indicate the lackluster promise of fun and prizes, with arrows pointing to the entrance of the midway.  The smells of old fish and blood mingle unpleasantly in the air."
