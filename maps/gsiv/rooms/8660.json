  "description": [
    "This small but lovely shop is packed full of display stands, each one housing a different instrument.  The maoral walls have been waxed to a warm golden hue, and a beautifully woven blue carpet covers the floor.  Sunshine floods in from framed glaesine windows that line the panelled walls at regular intervals."
