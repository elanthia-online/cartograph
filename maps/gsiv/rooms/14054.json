    "Tall oaks slowly give way to a thick growth of hemlocks.  The thick, scaly trunks of the conifers peek through the foliage here and there, their color a brown that appears more purple-grey when the light changes.  To the south, the trail angles toward an immense oak, which is just visible through foliage and a couple of cottages standing along the way."
