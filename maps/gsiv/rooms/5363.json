  "description": [
    "The mud and slop of the pens gives way to the mud and rock of the hill to the south.  A narrow path winds its way up.  The climb looks fairly difficult, given the slippery and uncertain footing.  At the other end, you can see the black maw of a large cave gaping from the hillside."
