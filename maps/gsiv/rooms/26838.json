    "Encircled by shadows and seedy brick buildings, the small park is more grey than green.  Thick tufts of crabgrass seem to battle the coarse monkeygrass for domination, while tangled knots of dark bushes separate the road from the attempted cultivation.  Rising in startling contrast to the surrounding area, a row of bright green hedges seems starkly out of place amid the unhappy expanse."
