    "Wrought iron display hooks are nailed directly to the rough sycamore wall that forms the shop's western wall, while a long wooden table is pushed against the off-white canvas walls on the east.  Swaying lanterns suspended from the ceiling provide ample light, though the flames flicker as wind plays off the sailcloth roof."
