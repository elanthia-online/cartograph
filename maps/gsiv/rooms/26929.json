  "description": [
    "Inlaid in the center of the circular room is a round parquet dance floor.  Several inviting crescent-shaped couches scattered with soft fur pillows are nestled along the walls.  An orb-shaped chandelier set with bits of mirrored stained glass reflects the light from surrounding sconces, setting a soft ambience.  A stately curved hoarbeam bar stands lined with a variety colorful glasses and trays.  A small, shield-shaped dart board hangs on the wall beneath a red banner of a great black wolf."
