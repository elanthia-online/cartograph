    "A veritable armory's worth of weapons have been mounted on the walls, the metal polished to a high gleam.  Blued steel flamberges are mounted next to invar claidhmores, interspersed with smaller weapons such as dirks and fist-scythes.  All the weapons are centered around a vaalorn plaque.  A simple limestone arch is bordered on each side by an upright pike."
