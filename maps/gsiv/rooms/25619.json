  "description": [
    "Along this stretch, the roots of several trees lie exposed where soil has been eroded by the river.  In the midst of one such root cluster, a turtle floats serenely, only its head and upper shell exposed.  Further along, a large oak tilts precariously out over the water, clinging desperately to its worn away foundation.  Some enterprising individual has taken advantage of the tree's situation by attaching a rope swing to one of the stouter branches."
