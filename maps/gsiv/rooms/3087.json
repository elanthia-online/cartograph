    "A horse-drawn plow and several shovels rest by the side of the road, awaiting the next major storm.  A massive chain hangs from the front of the plow to fasten to a team of draft horses or some other huge pack animal.  A large scrape along the edge of the roadway looks to have been created by the blade of the plow hitting a protruding flagstone as it was pushed over the ice-covered street."
