    "The steep, rocky cliffs of the foothills rise to the north and east, bringing an end to the verdant grasslands.  Reaching steeply upward, the rough face of the cliffs offers no handhold for further travel.  The wind rushes down from the high hills, bearing with it the scent of thin, fresh air."
