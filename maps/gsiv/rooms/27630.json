    "The warmth and humidity of the sauna is instantly discernable in sharp contrast to the weather outside.  Circling the room, slatted wooden benches provide ample respite in the luxurious heat that the room provides.  A copper basin of stones rests above a stone fire pit, dug shallowly into the ground in the center of the room.  A rope-handled wooden pail rests near the fire pit, with the handle of a ladle hooked on its lip."
