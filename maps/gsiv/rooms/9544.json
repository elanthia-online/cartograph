    "Fireflies flit, whirl and hover above the thick layer of bones, their abdomens winking on and off in small flashing displays of emerald light.  The light does nothing to warm the area, though, and the dim green cast only adds to the impression of lifeless scenery.  White bones, black walls, and pale green light combine to create an eerie starkness to the landscape.  It might even be a serene starkness were it not for the cries, moans and roars that come from deep within the piled bones."
