    "Mounds of thick, spongy moss cover the ground in this cozy loft.  A large, octagonal lantern hangs from the slightly domed ceiling and sways slightly with the tree's movements.  Several depressions have been carved into one side wall, creating a ladder which leads downward.  The strong scent of cedar permeates the air."
