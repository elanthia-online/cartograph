    "Fine black sand continues to stretch in a slight arc between the points of the cliffs, with the approaching sea a matching darkness that reflects the moonlight.  Streamers of kelp litter the beach and glisten in the glow produced by the line of flaming torches lighting the way for diggers.  A small white crab skitters along in a wavering gait avoiding the wash of waves.",
    "Fine black sand continues to stretch in a slight arc between the points of the cliffs, with the approaching sea more green than blue in the sunlight.  Streamers of kelp litter the beach, its surface horizontally rippled from the changing tide.  A small white crab skitters along in a wavering gait avoiding the wash of waves."
