    "The pathway narrows suddenly into little more than the track of the errant animals who have made the fens their home.  An increasing number of reeds appear to the east between slow moving tendrils of fog which rise from the surrounding marshy waters to drift gradually towards the sky.  Scattered across a low mound not far from the path are the remains of a human skeleton, bereft of the bones from its lower half and draped across the ground as if attempting to crawl away."
