    "A thick deciduous forest rises out of the fog to the north.  Birch and poplar trees, tightly interwoven, form a screen that prevents passage, shunting the trail off to the northeast.  As if the tree branches and trunks were not enough, a maze of holly bushes grows underneath the trees, their sharply serrated leaves waiting to rend and tear should anyone or anything be foolish enough to try to force its way into the forest.  To the southwest the trail moves out into the open moor."
