  "description": [
    "A mass of tangled creepers and briars has overgrown the path, its wispy tendrils wrapping around the nearby oak trunks.  A man-sized wooden figurine, its engraved surface barely visible within the tentacled foliage, stands amid the amassed greenery, its minute details lost amid the clinging vines.  Although heavy with the weight of the thorny growth, the figurine remains standing, as if it refuses to yield."
