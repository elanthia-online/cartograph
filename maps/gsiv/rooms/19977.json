    "It seems colder here than the neighboring areas, though the snow and ice covering the space are not real, merely a fabrication that resembles reality.  The diorama for this climate resides behind a glass wall, protecting its inhabitants collectively instead of in individual cases.  A low moan and a high pitched shriek sound through the room at odd intervals, imitating the fierce winds across the arctic terrain.  Several silver-framed paintings adorn the wall opposite the glass, showcasing more denizens of the glacier."
