    "A circular balcony fashioned of brilliantly polished mithril surrounds the entire room.  Daylight streams through the domed ceiling above, though the vision below is far more ominous.  Ascending from far below is a model of the Eye of V'tull, its cone rising through the center of the balcony's ring.  Its edge is close, just on the other side of the balcony's rail.",

The domed ceiling above sparkles with the reflection of torchlight off the hundreds of white starstones that dangle from the blue-black canopy.  Ascending from far below is a model of the Eye of V'tull, its cone rising through the center of the balcony's ring.  Its edge is close, just on the other side of the balcony's rail."
