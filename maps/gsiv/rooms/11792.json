    "A small and very crude mudpit has been built out of stacked logs, but the height of the walls doesn't look nearly tall enough to keep the large beast inside it from escaping.  There is a evil gleam in the eyes of the reptilian critter, and it doesn't look as if it has eaten in weeks.  A battered sign has been shoved into the ground near the pit."
