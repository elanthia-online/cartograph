    "Descending into a wide courtyard is a set of long steps, their sides adorned with golden-hued oak railings.  Crumbling walls painted with paneled mosaics line the old entryway only to fall away into ruined arches further to the south.  White censors strung from rod-iron poles give the air a strong musky scent as smoke pours from their shield-shaped openings.  The loud cawing of wild birds shatters the silence that hangs in the steamy, scent-laden air."
