    "The hallway widens into a round, domed structure, the arching columns that hold up the roof housing elaborate paintings that bridge the gaps between the ivory-hued supports.  The surrealistic tree-like paintings sweep across the dome in delicate, swirling patterns, accenting the fine architecture that adorns the room."
