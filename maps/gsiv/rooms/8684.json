    "This tiny garden niche provides an oasis from busy city traffic.  A few small trees lend shade to the polished granite bench that rests underneath.  Shrubs and flowers have been placed strategically, their colors blending together in perfect harmony.  In the center of everything resides a large granite fountain, its clear blue water falling in intermittent gusts and sprays."
