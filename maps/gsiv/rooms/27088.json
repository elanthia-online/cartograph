    "The knoll peeks out from over the treetops, offering a view of the vast bog oak forest below.  A sovereign weeping willow tree encompasses the hilltop -- the warm sunlight shining down on the leaves that sweep over the hillock.  Red-veined ferns surround the trunk of the tree in the shape of a ten-pointed star."
