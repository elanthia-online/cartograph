    "A large but badly flawed quartz crystal embedded into the ceiling catches the torchlight and glitters with an eerie reddish glow.  Thousands of other tiny minerals trapped in the walls catch the light as well and they form the illusion of an underground evening sky.  If the stench of molding plants and moist earth wasn't so strong, this might be a very romantic spot."
