    "Sparse candlelight casts flickering shadows along the walls and floor of this musty smelling room.  An old, worn out tapestry hangs along a side wall, where a crack resembling a jagged, toothy smile disappears behind it.  A large wardrobe closet along the far wall stands open, and items of various colors and materials are haphazardly strewn within.  The light within the room is distorted by two mirrors, one an oversized wavy glass mirror and the other an immaculately polished mirror, each one facing the other."
