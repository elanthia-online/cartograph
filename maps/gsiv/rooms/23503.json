    "A portrait of a scowling dwarf is hung above the long modwir bar flanked by two brass lanterns.  The bar itself gleams from a fresh polishing as evidenced by the damp cleaning rag left lying on top of it.  The multitude of liquor bottles and tapped kegs behind the bar are expertly secured for sea by sailors who obviously take their drinking seriously.  A ragged mop lies propped up by the exit to the main barroom.  At one end of the bar, an open doorway is shrouded in shadows and a smoky haze."
