    "A deep, cold pool sits in the middle of a clearing, like a spider in the center of her web.  Dense, lush banks of ferns stretch up from the banks to the feet of quiet residences, their facades as silent as the still water.  Birds occasionally wing through the still grotto, silent as if mindful of the shadowy ambiance."
