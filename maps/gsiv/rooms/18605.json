    "Dark ebonwood panels line the walls of this small room, their mottled surfaces dimly illuminated by several large pillar candles.  The statue of a man bedecked in black chain-mail is located within a small arched alcove, the white marble around him a stark contrast to the dark surroundings.  The man's face is stony even for a statue, and a grimly determined expression has been chiseled upon his face.  A simple black altar sits before the shallow niche, an ivory kite shield lying upon its surface."
