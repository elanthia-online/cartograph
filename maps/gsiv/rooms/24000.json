  "description": [
    "A large old oak trunk, fallen alongside the path, is home to tiny ferns and abundant animal life.  Surrounded by a mixture of ferns and hostas, its decaying bark fills the area with an earthy scent.  Behind a quartz-inlaid white marble bench stands a single glaesine lantern that swings from a short ironwork post.  Rising in the middle of a ring of red-traced pink carnations is a white marble statue, standing proudly in the dappled sunlight."
