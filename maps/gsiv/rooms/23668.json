    "Tall glass windows allow sunlight to slip in through the thick foliage outside.  Stone steps lead down into a small pool, large enough for swimming.  An indigo curtained arch keeps the chilled air inside the room, cooling the water, while a polished oak door stands partially closed for the same reason."
