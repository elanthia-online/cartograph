  "description": [
    "Jutting out of the ground at an unusual angle, a wooden lantern post marks the end of the fence, as well as the street.  A failing wooden bridge connects the road to the southeast, providing passage over a violently rushing stream.  The water below is murky and dark, and jagged rocks break through its surface.  A sour stench emanates from the small body of water, and tiny bubbles foam along the bank, popping with unnatural clarity."
