    "The twisted mass of vines and small bushes that have nearly overtaken the village make travel difficult, but not impossible.  Nothing has escaped their insidious, creeping onslaught.  Nearby, the walls of the guild hall and jail show signs of being gradually overtaken, as tendrils push their way through even the tiniest cracks in the outer walls.",

Nearby, the walls of the guild hall and jail show signs of being gradually overtaken, as bright tendrils of green push their way through even the tiniest cracks in the outer walls."
