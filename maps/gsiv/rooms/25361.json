  "description": [
    "Alternating tiles of black and white marble, though elegant in design, give a whimsical welcome with chalked barefoot footprints marching across every other tile.  Thick arrows scrawled with various words serve as directional guides to other areas, and a grand staircase leads to the manor's upper floors."
