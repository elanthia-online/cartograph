  "description": [
    "The water is alive with penguins.  They swim all about the pool, diving and splashing so comically that you cannot help but laugh.  The water is freezing cold, making your teeth chatter and turning your lips blue, but the birds don't seem to mind in the slightest.  To the side you spy an icy ledge that you believe you could climb to get out of the drink."
