  "description": [
    "Dominating the office of the Guildmaster is a gold-flecked white granite desk occupied by a variety of important paperwork.  An elegantly carved bookshelf holds numerous thick tomes and a handful of colorful glaes figurines.  Hung on the opposing wall is a vivid landscape of the snow-capped DragonSpine mountains rendered in fine oil paints.  A small iron-wrought stand holds a lavender ceramic teapot, kept warm by a heated plate."
