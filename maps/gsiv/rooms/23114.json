    "Several sets of free-standing shelves line the outskirts of this area of the tent, and a myriad of jars, canisters, vials, and tubs are arranged among them.  Though the contents of the containers are not obvious on first glance, the smell emanating from some of them is enough to keep the more curious at bay.  Old and discarded bones of various shapes and sizes litter the ground, their colors dull and dark from time and the accumulation of dirt."
