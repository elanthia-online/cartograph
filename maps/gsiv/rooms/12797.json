    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of an unfinished wooden floor.  There is a large oak table on one side of the shop and a gold-trimmed ebonwood chest on the other.",
    "Beneath a sturdy white cedar ceiling, an antique wall hanging hangs on one of the patterned white walls.  A gold-trimmed ebonwood chest and a large oak table sit in opposite corners while an ivory elven noble statue rests on a cream-colored ceramic tile floor."
