    "Plush midnight blue velvet encloses this comfortable observation gallery filled with some cushioned chairs facing a sizable viewing window.  The tiered floor steps upwards from the window allowing each row of seats an unobstructed view of the landscape outside.  Covering the opposite wall is a wide midnight and silver threaded tapestry.  Ascending to the deck above is a chrome-railed spiral staircase."
