  "description": [
    "Slivers of moonlight trickle through the wide entrance, illuminating the shadowy plants and grasses spreading beside the rocky walls.  Mosses and ferns thrive in the cool, moist environment provided by the cave entrance.  The constant temperature and high humidity provide a more stable environment for the plant life here, compared to their brethren out in the open."
