    "Thick patches of hardy underbrush and weeds grow against the side of the massive mound, their older and drier leaves and branches charred and falling to ash.  An odd layer of blackened, burnt vegetation mixes with the reddish earth, sticking to your feet and clothing.  A low, dark tunnel leads into the side of the huge mound, the brush near its opening almost completely burned away."
