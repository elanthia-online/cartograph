    "The center of the cemetery is marked by a statue of robed woman on a pedestal surrounded by dirt ruts that circle her once, then split away to the east.  Clusters of lilies grow around the base of the pedestal and fill the area with a sweet, rich aroma.  Headstones of varying sizes and makes populate the grass expanse up to the edge of the bluff to the north, some nearly invisible behind tall grasses and weeds."
