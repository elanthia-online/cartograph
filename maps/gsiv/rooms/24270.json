    "Iridescent red streamers dappled with globs of silver glitter hang from the ceiling and sway lazily back and forth.  Fresh apple fragrance mixed with a myriad of other scents lingers in the air, intensifying as customers rush past with their gooey treats in hand.  A propped-up wheelbarrow filled with ripe apples flanks one side of the tent's flap, and tablecloths embroidered with miniature apple leaves are neatly draped over both an oblong counter and a sphere-footed sideboard."
