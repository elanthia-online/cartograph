  "description": [
    "An ivory-hued pool ripples quietly within an upraised platform -- its edges swept with a runic pattern that intertwines in a thin circular border.  The peaked ceiling is also inscribed with a series of sigils, their pale sapphire hue resonating with a faint light every few moments.  Polished white marble walls gleam faintly with the pulsating light, and several elven guards stand at the threshold of a set of ivory spiral stairs leading further up."
