  "description": [
    "Illuminated by a blown-glaes chandelier hung from the cottage's crossbeam high above, the air is drenched in deliciously sweet and spicy smells.  A long glaes-paned counter runs the length of this tiny shop.  Nestled inside on small silver trays are various confections, each one more beautifully crafted than the last."
