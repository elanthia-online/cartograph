  "description": [
    "A steady *drip-drip-drip* echoes off of every facet of the surrounding rock walls, lending a near-deafening reverberation to the cramped, enclosed space.  Directly overhead and continuing down one wall, a deep fissure  proves to be the source of the watery incursion.  A spiderweb of cracks spreading from it lend an air of impending danger to this part of the tunnel."
