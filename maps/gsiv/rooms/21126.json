  "description": [
    "In the dark corners of this unearthed temple, a myriad of shadows surrender ancient walls made of time-shrouded obsidian.  Light itself almost seems devoured by the somber atmosphere present.  Carved in relief along the decrepit walls are various depictions of gods among the Lornon pantheon, all of which center toward a giant spherical idol of the dark moon itself.  A chilling wind blows discordantly throughout the hall from places unknown, while a black altar rests to one side, opposite a panel that stands slightly ajar."
