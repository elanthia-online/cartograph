  "description": [
    "Boulder-sized clumps of earth have dislodged from the ceiling, creating a series of dirt piles blocking direct forward egress down the corridor, despite the unusually wide girth of the passage.  A broken cart leans precariously against one wall, its contents spilling out the back and down onto the ruin floor.  The abandoned supplies are covered in a thick film of dust, forgotten despite the frequent traffic in the passage."
