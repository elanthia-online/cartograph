  "description": [
    "Beyond the kitchen door, the clang of pots and pans adds occasional percussion to the slow sizzle and simmer of dishes being prepared by several halfling chefs.  Raw ingredients are neatly separated along the surface of a hexagonal marble island at the chamber's center.  A few weary-looking serving staff are dedicated to cleaning up after the cooks, lending an industrious, even-paced bustle to the kitchen."
