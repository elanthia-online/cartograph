    "Cicadas provide a low droning throughout the grassland.  The insects seem to be in perfect cadence, as if someone has orchestrated them all.  Their noises rise and fall together in intensity, ranging from extremely loud to a bare background tone.  All at once the buzzing ceases entirely, and the silence seems to be louder than the noise that preceded it.  Then, as if on cue, the cicadas pick up again where they left off."
