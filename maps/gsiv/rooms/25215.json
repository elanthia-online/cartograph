    "Faint light filters in from the north, illuminating several dark green emeralds inset into the cavern walls.  The gems sparkle as the flickering rays play across their form, their color a sharp contrast to the mute tones of the surroundings.  A few stalactites cast shadows upon the floor, most short and unobtrusive to the cramped chamber.  The tunnel leads further north, the dust on the ground seeming quite well trodden."
