    "A deep ravine opens to the west, a narrow trail leading down into its shaded depths.  The path slopes gently up the hilltop to the south, winding amid stately modwirs and patches of bright wildflowers.  Bees and other insects buzz among the flowers and underbrush, their steady hum echoing quietly in the otherwise silent woods."
