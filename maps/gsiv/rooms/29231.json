  "description": [
    "Dense forest growth along this western edge of the weald obscures all but a few narrow beams of golden sunlight from above.  An ancient sycamore proclaims itself ruler of this space, its six-foot diameter and tall, spreading crown keeping all but the hardiest of saplings from reaching for the sky.  A scattering of shed antlers marks this as a gathering place for herds of large ungulate natives of Kraken's Fall."
