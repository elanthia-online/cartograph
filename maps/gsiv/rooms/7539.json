    "An ancient brick tunnel lined with pipe openings leads to the northwest and southeast here.  Most of the water running down its center seems to be coming from only a few of the pipes, and the flow tapers off to the northwest.  Another smaller passage heading west opens out of the southwestern wall a few feet above the floor."
