    "Not one cloud makes an attempt to block the moons here on the plateau.  Brightly, but without warmth, the moonlight beams down on the flat rock surface, reflecting harshly off the smooth basalt.  Below, the moonlight also bounces brilliantly off the white cloud layer that surrounds the plateau, shimmering intensely until it becomes too vivid to look at.  The starry sky provides a much easier resting place for the eyes, although eventually it, too, becomes much too monotonous.",
