    "Large tables with flamboyantly dressed halfling merchants are scattered around the center part of the bazaar.  Off to the edge of the bazaar more tables are set up with merchants of various races trying to hawk their wares.  As you move between the tables each merchant in turn waves at you and motions for you to come closer to his table."
