    "Light slanting through the branches above reveals a cairn beside the road, though whether the rounded stones are a memorial to someone long vanished or merely the remnants of a toppled structure is impossible to tell.  One of the massive oaks along the causeway has fallen, the vacancy it left admitting dazzlingly bright sunlight that throws the thickly grown forest beyond it into deep shadow.",
    "Faint illumination slanting through the branches above reveals a cairn beside the road, though whether the rounded stones are a memorial to someone long vanished or merely the remains of a toppled structure is impossible to tell.  One of the massive oaks along the causeway has fallen, the vacancy it left now a clearing strewn with pale flowers that are silver in the moonlight."
