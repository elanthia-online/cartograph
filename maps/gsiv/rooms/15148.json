    "A midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the mottled grey marble walls, and an enameled modwir ceiling rises overhead.  A wooden statue of Rone Wehnimer sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is a vine-carved mahogany table on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
