    "In a sharp contrast to the rest of the tavern, this room is very well decorated.  Tapestries of mountain and forest scenes hang on the walls, and thick carpeting runs from wall to wall.  Elaborate candelabras stand in each corner, each filled with fresh scented candles.  The window is crystal clear, overlooking the southern section of the valley, the dim moonlight providing just enough light to see the features of the surrounding mountains.",
