    "Rich geometric mosaics of varying colors arc across the high vaulted ceiling of this long hallway, cloaked in soft muted shades by the golden oil lamps hung throughout the room.  Black tapestries trimmed with dark green silk billow gently between the thick ivory columns aligned in neatly ordered rows.  Interweaving patterns of gold are inlaid into the pure white floor, forming a myriad of ornate shapes with its graceful, arcing loops."
