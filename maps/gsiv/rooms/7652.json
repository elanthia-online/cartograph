    "The cave widens here and the rough floor drops away leaving you wading in cool, shallow water.  Looking around, you have a feeling of an otherworldly silence, as the sounds of your splashing are not reflected back to you by the cavern walls.  Below you, underneath the surface of the water, you see a faint emerald glow emanating from a small opening."
