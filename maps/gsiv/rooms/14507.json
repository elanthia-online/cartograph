  "description": [
    "A massive enclosure houses two separate terrains -- an arid, desert-like area strewn with sparse grasses and a lush rainforest area.  The desert habitat has been split further into two individual parts, one serving as a home for jackals and the other for foxes, each equipped with a sleeping den as well.  Heavy foliage provides ample cover for the bat-eared foxes that nimbly weave beneath the forest canopy."
