    "Daggers and tridents cover the walls of the shop, hints of cherrywood peeking out from behind the metal.  Large barrels are scattered haphazardly on the floor, filled with bottles, herbs, and the occasional pieces of leather armor.  The scent of cinnamon lingers faintly in the air.  An ironwood desk sits at the far wall, next to an open ebonwood door.  On the desk you notice an enruned vaalorn coffer."
