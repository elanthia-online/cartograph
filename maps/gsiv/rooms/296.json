    "The quiet of the moonlit street is broken by the sound of metal bouncing against metal.  A small group of rough-looking citizens gather in the shadow of the buildings, apparently busy at some gambling game.  From one small storefront comes the sound of a lilting melody being picked out on a lute.",
