    "Silence hangs heavy in the air, as if all of nature held its breath.  Even the mists are still, stagnating around the thorny plants and sky-reaching pines.  A current of tension coils about the trees, as if two great but unseen armies watched each other across a wooded battleground, merely waiting for the general's signal before exploding into violence."
