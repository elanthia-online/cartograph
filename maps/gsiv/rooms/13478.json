    "The branches of the ancient black willow tree twist about themselves, offering numerous locations throughout for comfortable seating.  Graceful black leaflets attached to long dark green stems shimmer a shadowy black as they rustle against the rough bark of the tree.  A faint rattling sound can be heard emanating from within the core of the tree.",
