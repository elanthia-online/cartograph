    "An archway gives entry to this room, which is enclosed by expanses of stone blocks.  Instead of windows, sculpted iron sconces perch high on the walls, each tri-limbed fixture shedding a wealth of amber light from a score of tawny-hued candles.  Opposite the entry is a carved ebonwood workbench laden with a variety of alchemic implements, austere in its meticulous arrangement.  An elaborately woven tapestry rug is the only aesthetic relief offered in this otherwise somber chamber."
