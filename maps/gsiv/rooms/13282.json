  "description": [
    "A broad silver archway leads further southeast, its wide gap filled with a variety of shadowy silken swaths.  An immaculate mural of a hawk has been painted above the very apex of the arch, its pale wings, sharp eyes, and curved beak adding a subtly regal ambiance to the surroundings.  A long velvet rug spills out from the interior of the arch, its dark hue complimenting the lustrous, fine silver hue of its subtle ridges."
