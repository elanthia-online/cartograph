  "description": [
    "Bright light filters in from above, the beautiful rainbow sheen of the slime offset by the pungent, acrid smell that wafts through the tunnel and invades your senses.  The roots around you move more slowly now, their forms appearing more rigid and wooden than the fluid, tentacle-like structures below you.  Each wraps around various parts of your body tightly, the pressure from their dutiful grasp nearly painful."
