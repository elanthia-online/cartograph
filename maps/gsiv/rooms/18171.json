    "One side of the room is occupied by a long granite counter which holds several stone mortars, while the other side looks almost chaotically cluttered.  Innumerable vials, bottles, and all manner of containers vie for space and attention on black-painted shelves, which seem to blend into the walls of the same hue.  At first glance, the contrast of porcelain, glass, metal, and bone of varying colors gives the impression of magically floating stock which may collapse at any time."
