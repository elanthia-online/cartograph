    "Boles of trees loom up into a thick jungle canopy like smooth-skinned towers on all sides.  At places on the trunks, epiphytes cling with loopy, tangled root systems, their gaudy flowers displaying color that even manages to penetrate the darkness.  A cacophony of sound rises from frogs and other invisible creatures prowling in the dank heart of the foliage.  East of the trail, a huge strangling fig tree lifts its branches toward the moons, their leaves covered with a lacework of vines and mosses.",
    "Boles of trees loom up into a thick jungle canopy like smooth-skinned towers on all sides.  At places on the trunks, epiphytes cling with loopy, tangled root systems, their broad leaves and gaudy flowers creating a riot of color in the green twilight.  A cacophony of sound rises from birds, insects and invisible creatures prowling in the dank heart of the foliage.  East of the trail, a huge strangling fig tree lifts its branches toward the sky, their leaves covered with a lacework of vines and mosses."
