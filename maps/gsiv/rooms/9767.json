    "The passageway comes to an abrupt end in a small, dark niche.  Ridges run underfoot through the floor and up into the walls, making the footing somewhat treacherous and uneven.  The walls have a rough, wavy texture with the exception of the far one, which is smooth and made of wood.  Occasionally, the entire room shudders in a rhythmic, pulsing motion and contracts in upon itself before returning to its normal size."
