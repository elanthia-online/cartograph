    "Large cobblestone blocks, grey and slippery from years of water damage, form the walls of this circular section of sewer, their smooth faces interrupted by the placement of pipes and drains.  A long marble staircase follows the curve of the wall, providing egress for denizens, beneath which are pendant lanterns crafted of glowing witch-balls that are filled with bright white lights.  Two tunnels lead away from the area, each with a small black pennant that prominently displays an ivory raven skull with a bound beak."
