    "A crimson and gold wool rug, woven with the image of a fortress, stretches across the floor of the wagon.  A low wooden bunk over a wooden drawer with a gear for a handle is built into the rear of the wagon, reinforced with two thick steel chains that secure it to the wall.  Brightly colored tapestries line the walls above neatly organized workspaces that hold bits of leather, assorted metal rings and plates, and other materials used in armor manufacturing.  Nearly hidden behind a diminutive armoire inlaid with copper sprockets is a small wooden hatch that leads outside."
