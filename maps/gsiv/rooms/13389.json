    "The side of the ancient manor looms to the west, the edges of its arched windows chased with swirling silver patterns.  A variety of black and crimson roses have been cultivated upon a pale white trellis that runs halfway up the house, their intricate petals and thorny vines adding an indelible touch of elegance to the ancient manor."
