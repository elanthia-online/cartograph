    "Wind rustles through the dry stalks of plants in what must have been a small vegetable garden.  The neat rows of plants have all withered and died, but strangely no other damage is evident.  To the north rises the sheer face of the mountain, capped in dark clouds, and a splintered door leads back into the temple to the southeast.",
