  "description": [
    "A fountain sits in the center surrounded by pie-shaped beds of blossoming flowers with just enough space between them to allow one to wander the gardens.  To the west, a huge banyan tree looms, its overhanging boughs partially enclosing the area to form a quiet bower.  This partially shaded retreat provides a silent place of contemplation, where the only distractions are the quick flicks of motion as fireflies flit from tree to tree, or flower to flower."
