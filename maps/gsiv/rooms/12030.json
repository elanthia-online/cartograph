  "description": [
    "A huge pedestal of pinkish-white marble rests at the northwest corner of the plaza.  Whatever image once rested upon this pedestal is now gone, perhaps sunk in the depths of the lake to the north of the pyramid.  All that remains is a portion of one elfish foot, broken off at the arch, leaving behind only a few surprisingly feminine-looking toes."
