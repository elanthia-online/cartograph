    "Traffic is light along this tree-lined street.  A bespectacled old dwarf stands before a granite statue, lecturing a group of children.  They giggle, jump and scurry about.  Seated on a bench across the street, an elderly dwarf smiles at the young.  Perhaps a hundred feet to the east, the canyon walls tower overhead.",
    "The street is nearly empty, quiet in the night air.  A granite statue casts faint shadows in the dim light, waiting for the sun to rise and wake the birds that are its constant companions.  Stars twinkle overhead, winking and blinking in the black sky."
