    "Massive maoral doors leading into the temple are plated with sheets of beaten gold and laden with embossed pegasi.  Accent blocks of milky quartz flecked with azurite edge windows and archways, creating a translucent design amid the more opaque bricks of white marble.  Towering pale haon winged horses stand upright, with their front hooves braced against the walls, ribbing the length of the building in a series of buttresses."
