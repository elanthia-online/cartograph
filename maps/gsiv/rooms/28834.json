  "description": [
    "A hump of rounded black stone breaches out of the swampy muck, bending into a pitch black path to the northwest.  Toward the south, the walkway retreats away from the river's edge, humid swampland giving way to moss-carpeted stone.  Torchlight glows in the southern distance, the source not visible but obvious from its reflection off of a moisture-sheened spot expanse of the cavern ceiling."
