    "The walls of the armory are lined with weapons lockers designed to hold every form of weapon known to personal combat.  Above are large and detailed maps showing every detail of the countryside around Icemule Trace.  Dominating the center of the room is a large, round table surrounded by simple stools, its scratches and stains testimony to the many successful campaigns directed from these very planks."
