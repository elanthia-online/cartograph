    "A small ceramic-tiled mudroom opens up into the interior of the wagon.  A soft area rug, woven from prismatic hues, covers a large area of the oak floor.  Lengths of silk have been suspended from the ceiling, draping across the rows of rectangular windows along the upper edge of each wall and coloring the light as it crosses the room.  Flanked on the left by a cherrywood armoire is an intricate rack fashioned into a weeping willow tree.  Opposite the rack, a row of pegs displays numerous containers",
