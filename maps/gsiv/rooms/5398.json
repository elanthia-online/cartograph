    "The walls are half paneled with modwir wood with whitewashed walls above.  Time darkened beams above support brass oil lanterns.  Just to the right of some well-worn oaken stairs is a large painting of a ship in a stormy sea.  From the common room to the east comes the clink of glasses and the sound of conversation."
