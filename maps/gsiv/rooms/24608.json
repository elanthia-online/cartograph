    "Several tents are arranged in a semicircle, the brightly-colored fabric walls billowing in the night's breeze.  A worn stone bench, carved with nearly illegible runes, sits beneath a nearby maoral tree.  Glaes-paned oil lamps swing from small ironwork posts, casting dim amber light across the landscape."
