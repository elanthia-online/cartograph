    "Banners of bright green silk suspended from each wall are so clean and pressed they look as if they might have been hung yesterday.  There is not a trace of dust or age on any of the hangings, and the embroidered pastries that adorn each of them have been stitched so expertly, it almost looks as if one could pluck them off and eat them."
