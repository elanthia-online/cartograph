  "description": [
    "Mostly obscure in the dark, the path solidifes into a hazardous, rocky incline winding its way to higher ground, as opposed to the chaotic mass of scree below.  Beneath the starlight, the mica flecks that so pervade the nearby rocks glitter like a reflection of the night sky.",
    "Curving sharply like a hairpin, the path solidifies into a hazardous, rocky incline winding its way to higher ground, as opposed to the chaotic mass of scree below.  Scraggly weeds sprout from the dark spaces between rocks, drinking in the ample moisture from the humid air."
