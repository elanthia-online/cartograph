    "[Tiny Cottage, Back Garden]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "This well tended garden in the back of the tiny cottage seems to specialize in herbs both medicinal and culinary.  Red clay paving stones provide a way to navigate through the garden without crushing any of the carefully nurtured plants and a high stone wall protects the plants from marauding intruders from the surrounding woods.  A heavy oak door provides entrance into the cottage and a brick-lined footpath circles around the building to the east and the west."
