    "A sphere-hilted mounted sword plaque hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls, and a pebble textured ceiling rises overhead.  A wooden statue of Rone Wehnimer sits in one corner of an enameled modwir floor.  There is a Vornavian silk-lined display case on one side of the shop and a brass treasure chest on the other."
