    "An unofficial moneychanger appears to be doing a brisk business at the corner, moving from side to side of the road as he avoids any contact with town officials.  Brightly colored banners in silver and blue are hung from several windows, proclaiming the way to the Silvermule Gaming Hall and other nearby establishments."
