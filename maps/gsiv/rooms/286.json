    "Night guards and militiamen pass by, moving between the barracks and the guard towers at either end of the north road.  The broad cobblestoned way proceeds east and west, hugging the inside of the northern wall.

    "Guards and militiamen pass by, moving between the barracks and the guard towers at either end of the north road.  The broad cobblestoned way proceeds east and west, hugging the inside of the northern wall.  A varied mix of citizens and visitors, including wealthy merchants and their wives, grizzled-looking trappers with freshly-cured pelts slung over their shoulders, and many others who have come to seek their fortunes in Wehnimer's Landing, walk among the ever-vigilant guardsmen."
