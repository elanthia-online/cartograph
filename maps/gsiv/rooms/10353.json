    "Semicircular stone arches stand on either side of the cobbled path, their marble frames supporting an array of wooden flowerpots.  Hung from cords of braided twine, the flowerpots have been carved into a variety of decorative shapes, and each sustains a flowering plant in its soil-filled interior.  A sweet aroma, reminiscent of honey and delicate perfumes, lingers in the air.",
