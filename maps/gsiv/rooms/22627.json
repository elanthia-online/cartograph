    "Strips of wallpaper hang limply from the walls, faded and moldy, and bits and pieces of plaster litter the floor, leaving voids in the ceiling overhead.  High on one wall is a display of mannequin hands, some shorn at the wrist, while others have a partial forearm.  All are poised, fingers gnarled, as if clutching at the air or whomever might stray too near their grasp."
