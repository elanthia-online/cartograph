    "The walls of Jenkin the Scrivener's office are honeycombed with scroll and book shelves, all empty.  A thin layer of dust covers the room.  An elegantly penned note hangs from the upper edge of a writing desk in the middle of the room.  Through the archway north, a very large screw-like contraption can be seen."
