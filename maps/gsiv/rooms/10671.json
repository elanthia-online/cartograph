    "A four-post bed rests atop a pleasant yellow throw rug in one corner of the room, a matching floral comforter only adding to the grotesque effect of finding such furnishings in this location.  Covered with ale cups and papers, a black walnut table leans on one broken leg against a brick wall, surrounded by a variety of armchairs."
