    "Halos of light shine from a sconce hanging overhead with ruby red glass enclosing its light source.  The entry is shadowed, its high ceiling lost in gloom and surrounded by dark wood walls with heavily carved bas-relief surfaces.  A stairway leads down with barely enough light to illuminate the carpeted stairs and curved wooden banister, and from below, strains of music drift up in disjointed fragments, like spirits climbing out of the depths."
