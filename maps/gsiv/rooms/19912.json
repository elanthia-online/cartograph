  "description": [
    "The floor of the ravine opens out into a mossy expanse around a tiny stream that trickles merrily across the stony ground and disappears into a hole in the slope.  Squirrels, chipmunks and an occasional fox scurry in and out of the underbrush to drink, and woodland birds twitter in the branches overhead."
