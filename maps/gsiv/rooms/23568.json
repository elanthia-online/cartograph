    "A painted silk wall panel hangs on one of the white silk-paneled walls, and a sturdy bamboo-rafter ceiling rises overhead.  Some puffed raw silk pillows sits in one corner of a colorful mosaic floor.  There is a glass-topped mistwood counter on one side of the shop and a long brass clothing rack on the other."
