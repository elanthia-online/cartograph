    "A small clearing opens at the mouth of the overgrown trail, revealing a ramshackle hut squatting in its midst.  The dome-shaped structure, formed from stout birch trunks hammered into the hard earth and then bent upward to form a rounded roof, has been paneled with thick sheets of pliable wood to form exterior walls.  Although badly damaged and pocked with gaping holes, the hut appears stable.  An arched doorway leads within."
