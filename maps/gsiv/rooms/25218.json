    "The small plateau rests amidst an immense cavern lit by the ghostly glow of moss clinging to huge limestone stalagtites bearing down from the ceiling.  Answering stalagmites, sharp as a serpent's fangs, sprout out from the cavern floor.  To either side of the plateau is a precipitous drop into the darkness below, the only occupant of which is the howling wind.  At the center of the stony slab is an immense stone serpent head with massive ivory fangs bared.  Five crystal pillars encircle the statue."
