    "Riotous color rises on either side of the path, which forks slightly to the northeast, from the plethora of exotic flowers that sway in the sunlight.  Hummingbirds, tiny and emerald-winged, flit back and forth as they drink from the nectar of nature's bounty and tiny rabbits nibble the pearly white Imaera's lace that rings the dormant lampposts set just off the speckled cobbles.",
    "Luna moths shimmer in the silvery moonlight as they alight upon the exotic flowers lining the pathway which forks slightly to the northeast.  The pale, ethereal creatures stay clear of the golden pools of lamplight that illuminate the speckled cobbles and pearly white Imaera's lace growing at their bases."
