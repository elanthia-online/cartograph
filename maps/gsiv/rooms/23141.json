    "Elaborate silver sconces, affixed to polished oak walls, illuminate the spacious interior.  Several mannequins stand positioned next to some wooden racks, showcasing the offered wares.  Littered with clumps of dried mud, a dark crimson rug edged in golden filigree blankets most of the warped wooden flooring.  Tucked into the corner, a draped piece of dark velvet serves as a makeshift changing area."
