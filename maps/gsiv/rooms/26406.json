    "A sturdy handrail guides travelers along the newly laid walkway, supported by raised pilings below.  The water below is darker and somewhat deeper than the surrounding areas.  Colorful lanterns cast a silvery grey light across the foliage-choked miasma, catching the occasional flash of scales and fins leaping up through the watery undergrowth."
