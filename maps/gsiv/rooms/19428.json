    "The trees are thicker here and the pillars fewer.  Training in the martial arts, weaponry and bodybuilding occurs here as to the south, but the trainees seem better skilled.  The glass ceiling appears to admit ample light, but a torch rests in a sconce on each pillar in case cloud cover dims the illumination.  Iron pipes shiver and shake with the force of the steam flowing through them.  Despite the many footsteps that traverse this area, the floor is remarkably clean."
