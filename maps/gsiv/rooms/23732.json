    "Diffused sunlight spills through silk-veiled openings in the ceiling and casts a muted haze against pale crimson, raised panel walls.  Knotty pine shelves lined with paintbrushes, stacks of canvas, and other painting supplies, stretch from the entrance to the back of the studio where a raised platform showcases a couple easels."
