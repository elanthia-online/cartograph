    "In this bright, airy room, a feeling of peace overcomes you.  Some soft comfortable-looking pillows are scattered across the floor near a window looking into the gardens.  Resting above the mantle of a fieldstone fireplace you notice an oddly compelling painting.  An old maoral wooden medicine cabinet stands in one corner of the room."
