    "Tarnished silver tables feature numerous beakers, cauldrons, mortars and pestles in the midst of concocting potions, salves and tinctures.  A faint tang of magic lingers in the air, mingling with the numerous fragrances and odors of ingredients, some pleasant while others are bearable at best.  The heat from a large oven infuses the room with a distinctive, uncomfortable warmth."
