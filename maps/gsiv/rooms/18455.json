  "description": [
    "The grass has been worn thin in a small strip that leads up to the doors of a structure that could only be a distillery.  With every breeze that stirs the air, the scent of hops, too-sweet grapes, and malt drift through this part of the meadow.  A broken wagon wheel leans against the side of the building, ruined and abandoned for so long that a jasmine vine has begun to grow along the spokes.  Nearby is a sign made of aged barrel planks, and off a ways in the meadow is a crosseyed black cow."
