    "Warm woolen tapestries decorate the stone walls of this square tower, providing some measure of softness to what is otherwise a stark, military space.  A halfling militia guard paces in front of a narrow staircase that winds along the side and back walls before rising into the upper stories.  The double oak doors leading out to the intersection of two alleys swing loosely in the wind, providing very little in the way of protection against the chill."
