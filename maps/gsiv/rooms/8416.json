    "The walls and ceiling close in, creating a cavern-like feeling along this east-west passageway.  A clearly illuminated opening is nearby, while the opposite length of the tunnel extends into darkness.  An occasional flare of fiery lava glows from beneath the cracked stone floor, followed by the sharp tang of brimstone."
