    "A wide expanse of verdant meadow extends out to a silhouetted riparian buffer ringing the canyon and obscuring the trail weaving alongside a meandering creek.  The stillness of the night air allows the soft babbling sounds of the water to wash over the field, while the starry sky above intrigues even the most novice astronomer.  Several marble arbors are lit with oil lamps, providing refuge from inclement weather or merely a peaceful setting for quiet contemplation.",

From the path opening here, there is a view of an enclosed field full of wildflowers and dotted with marble arbors that provide several peaceful settings to inspire relaxation and introspection."
