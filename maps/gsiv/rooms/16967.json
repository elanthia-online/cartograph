    "The entirety of the room resembles a blackened heart underscored with veins of pure fire, the cracked and parched stone overhead roiling with the fury of an inferno.  The slick crystalline walls appear to hold the scorching lava at bay, and no heat appears to emanate from its surface.  Upon the far wall, a bubbling fount of magma continually reforms and collapses, white-hot lava spewing from it at random intervals."
