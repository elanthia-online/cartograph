    "[Locksmehr River, Plank Bridge]"

  "description": [
    "The bridge spans the shallow river, its planks well above the level of the water.  The bridge is built from weather-resistant cedar, and it even looks as if someone has taken the time to apply a coat of varnish to the handrail.  Someone made this bridge to last.  Below, the river snakes through boulders, rocks and logs as it slowly flows southward.  Fish dart from shady area to shady area as they search for food but fear the light."
