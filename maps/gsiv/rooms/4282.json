    "The trail turns, giving egress to a wide plateau, which is bejeweled with a pond that sparkles in the sunlight.  Birds wheel overhead, diving occasionally to alight near the water.  Cottages cluster in groups around the pool, some boasting picket fences and most decorated with gardens and brightly painted shutters.",
