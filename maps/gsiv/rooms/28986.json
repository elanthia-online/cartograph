  "description": [
    "Framed in mahogany, a polished sterling silver mirror is mounted on the western wall, the starlight reflecting off of its smooths surface, while below it copper and teak benches provide space for quiet repose.  Green shutters frame open, glass-free windows in the eastern wall, each providing a view of the streets beyond and bringing cool air into the narrow hallway.  A sterling silver serving cart rests in the middle of the golden linden floor, the sweet scent of pastries and the aroma of coffee rising from it."
