    "A low, narrow opening is the only entrance to the cove contained entirely within the cavern.  Flickering light from the water is reflected against the high ceiling and onto a cutter moored against a makeshift dock.  Most dry space available is covered in stacked boxes and crates.  Armed men and women dressed in simple clothing cross back and forth through the area, at work at one task or another, occasionally disappearing or arriving through a crevice on the west wall.  Hung on one wall is a wooden figurehead."
