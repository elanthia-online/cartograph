  "description": [
    "An aubergine wool carpet bordered by an a pattern of elaborate ivory scrolls mutes the sounds that drift in from the cartage.  Thick tapestries weave ancient stories of Illistim history, as well as keep the warmth in during winter.  The room is furnished simply, with a carved maoral desk as its centerpiece, flanked by two straight-backed chairs.  Nevertheless, there is an aura of opulence in this room, as if the smell of silver floats in the air."
