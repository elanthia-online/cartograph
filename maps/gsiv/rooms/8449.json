    "The path narrows to a mere handspan, forcing you to turn sideways and edge your way across, one careful step at a time.  No trees nor even bushes grow here to give you a handhold.  An occasional gust of wind howls past, threatening to pluck you from your unsteady perch, setting your heart thumping with terror."
