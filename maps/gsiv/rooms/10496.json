    "An ancient cobblestone road leads from the Mistydeep off into the steadily thickening forest to the southeast.  Two black marble drakes, their attitude of repose belied by one half-opened eye, rest on either side of a massive limestone bridge that crosses the water in the direction of Ta'Vaalor."
