    "Casting long shadows across the garden, a spiraling wooden staircase leads to a bright white balcony that is wreathed in thick wisteria vines.  Terra cotta tiles create a patio in front of a pair of glass-paned doors that provides entry into the villa, while opposite, a slender shell-lined pathway ambles down the gently sloping lawn to a quiet beach.  Thick bushes of white and pink dog roses encircle the small garden and form a decorative barrier to the less domesticated plant life of the island."
