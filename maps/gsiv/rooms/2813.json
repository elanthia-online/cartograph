  "description": [
    "Large, snow-covered boulders ridge the trail on the north, forming a low embankment that plunges down into a gorge.  The forest stands to the south, rising up the mountain in frosted tones ranging from green to black, dotted with splotches of white where snow has found purchase on the tree branches.  Brisk winds gust up from the gorge, whipping the nearby trees and casting mists of snow across the panorama."
