    "Following the natural contour of the land, a cobblestone walkway lined with columns meanders around a pool, large enough for several giantman to recline in comfortably.  Cascading waterfalls are etched on the bronze apron of the deep basin and set with a trim of golden topaz cabochons.  A detailed peacock on a field of blue rests at the center-bottom of the limestone lining.  A wrought-iron gate bars the end of the walkway, and the shape of a building is barely visible under the night sky.",

Cascading waterfalls are etched on the bronze apron of the deep basin and set with a trim of golden topaz cabochons.  A detailed peacock on a field of blue rests at the center-bottom of the limestone lining, beneath clear blue water.  At the end of the walkway a locked, wrought-iron gate leads to the steps of a grey marble manor house."
