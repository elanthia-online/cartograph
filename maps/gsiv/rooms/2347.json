    "Solid walls and towering pillars of ice imbue this room with an aura of dignity and strength.  The south wall is inlaid with two side-by-side symbols, and the walls to the east and west provide a backdrop for an altar and a large tapestry.  A woven rug threaded with hues of crimson, silver, azure and ivory covers most of the frozen floor, its intricate sigils forming an interwoven pattern of great beauty.  An ivory statue of a steed and an owl stands before the two wall symbols."
