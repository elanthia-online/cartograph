  "description": [
    "An ornate fireplace on the far wall dominates the room.  Standing guard over it is the Ranger Guild crest with a set of vesperti wings on either side of it.  Trophies from many a hunt line the walls here.  Comfortable-looking leather upholstered armchairs are arranged about the fire, offering a pleasant place to sit while recounting tales of the hunt."
