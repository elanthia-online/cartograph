    "Slabs of the finest marble and granite line the edges of this opulent display room.  Gilded gold candelabra stand like guards at each corner, the light from their candles casting a soft glow across a display of polished woods.  A well-dressed woman wanders the room with a porcelain tray offering tea and pastries to customers."
