    "Ice and snow whirl around in a shifting dance, caressing the mountainside then racing away in a cloud which leaves a majestic view of the arctic plains in its wake.  In the far distance, the tiny forms of a couple of polar bears cavort in a patch of sunlight.  The bears roll and tumble in play, until they are swallowed up along with the horizon in the persistent blizzard.  A trail winds to the northwest and southwest in a dangerous bend that traverses gaps and stone outcroppings.",
    "Ice and snow whirl around in a shifting dance, caressing the mountainside then racing away in a cloud which leaves a majestic view of the moonlit plains in its wake.  In the far distance, a pair of snowy owls patrols the night sky, until they are swallowed up along with the horizon in the persistent blizzard.  A trail winds to the northwest and southwest in a dangerous bend that traverses gaps and stone outcroppings."
