    "On the west side of this narrow stretch of Cheridin Avenue is the unlit back of the Moot Hall, and the dour building that houses the local constabulary and its jail looms along the other side of the street.  To the southeast, a stone dome rises over the compound that surrounds the Landing's largest temple.  Passers-by here move quickly north and south without much pause.",
