    "[Oak Tree, Wooden Perch]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "This well-constructed perch has been situated half inside the tree and half outside.  An ornate carved railing surrounds the edge in a half-moon shape, providing protection from falling.  From this height, the ground is not visible at all.  All you can see is green leaves and branches to all sides.  Off to one side of the perch is a sturdy oak ladder leading up to another platform."
