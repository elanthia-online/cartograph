    "Burgundy and gold damask frame the arched windows and alcoves lining the walls of this spacious room.  The polished oak floor beckons you to the dance while comfortable sofas fill the alcoves, inviting guests weary from the dance to rest.  A marble archway to the north leads to the foyer.",
    "Magnificent cut-crystal chandeliers, hung above the gleaming gold-veined marble floor, softly illuminate the ballroom.  Golden silk frames the alcoves lining the west wall.  An exquisite mural covers the remaining walls.  Tucked in each alcove are elegant settees and chairs in conversational groups.  Musicians populate a long mahogany stage carved with gilded lions at each corner.  Tall topiaries stand between alcoves, and liveried servants flank the marble archway to the north, ready to attend guests."
