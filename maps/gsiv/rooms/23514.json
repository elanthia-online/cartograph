    "Surrounding you are tall clumps of green kelp, the growth so thick as to prevent further progress swimming the deep.  As the current sends the water swirling ever-so-slightly, the kelp dances to-and-fro, bobbing around in fanciful gestures.  The whole forest reaches up from the ocean floor, which is too deep to be visible, though large croppings of coral rock shoot up into sight at irregular intervals.  Splintering the light from above, brownish-green pieces of loose kelp float atop the water's surface."
