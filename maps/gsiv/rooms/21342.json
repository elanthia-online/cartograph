    "Here, just outside the tree, is a small walled-in courtyard where several tables and chairs are sheltered beneath the leafy branches.  Mouthwatering aromas of baked goods and other delights lead the way to a pair of large ovens placed safely far away from the tree trunk.  An elderly halfling woman smiles briefly at you before going back to her baking."
