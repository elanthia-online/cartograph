  "description": [
    "Walls and floor of polished cherry give this large, open room a rich, elegant feel.  Several glass cases hold examples of weaponry of all types, and bright light from wall sconces and ceiling-hung lanterns glitters off the blades.  Inlaid in hammered gold in the center of the floor is the outline of a huge raven, its wings spread wide and its talons extended to strike.  Rowdy shouts echo from the game room to the north, and from the east, the soft hum of conversation drifts in from the bar."
