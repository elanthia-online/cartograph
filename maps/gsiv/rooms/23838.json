    "Octagonal in shape, this spacious, domed room is notable for the inlaid silver outline of a large dueling circle on the floor, enwrapped on seven sides by double-wide ebonwood prie-dieux with flame red velvet cushions.  On the eighth side of the room against the wall, is an imposing black iron chair on an elevated platform.  The upper portion of each wall is hung with a thick woolen tapestry woven in brilliant colors.  Several pairs of silver-bladed dueling swords hang on either side of the entryway."
