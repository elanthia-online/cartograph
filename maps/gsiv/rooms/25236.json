    "The ground here is uneven, the patterned floor smashed in various places, each cavity appearing in the shape of a massive footprint.  The bright desert sun sheens across the domed ceiling and bathes the area in a warm bronze glow.  Weak, unnatural moaning drifts in from further down the chamber."
