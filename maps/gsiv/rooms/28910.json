  "description": [
    "Empty lots filled with scraggly sea grass rise along the northern edge of the avenue amid small cabanas with terra cotta roofs.  Carried by the wind, the sound of hammering, buzzing, and voices trickles in from the south, though the voices are too soft to make out individual words and the other sounds are faint enough to not be an annoyance.  A small store, flanked by clotheslines of dyed fabric, rests in a manicured lawn by itself on the southeast corner of the cobblestone expanse."
