    "A fair-haired boy stands upon the battleground.  His wounds are grievous, coating him in blood and gore.  In his hands he holds a staff, fighting valiantly to hold off six men also armed with sharply pointed sticks.  In a sweeping movement he overextends, falling to the ground with a cry of pain and frustration.  As the first staff descends upon his head the scene fades, leaving you alone upon the field of war."
