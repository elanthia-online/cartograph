    "A large, wooden wine bottle hangs from the overhanging story of one of the town homes near the corner of Grebe Lane.  An inebriated giantman leans against the front of the building, but appears unaware of it other than as a convenient support.  The sounds of joviality and music from further west carry on the breeze."
