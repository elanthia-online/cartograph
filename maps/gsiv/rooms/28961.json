    "Navy blue rugs bordered with braided gold rope and bright white anchors cushion the long hallway as it stretches to the east and west.  Wrought iron rings dangle from the ceiling and hold aloft glass-fronted lanterns that shed bright yellow light and dispel all surrounding shadows.  Fitted into the terminus of the expanse, a pair of maple double doors sits beneath an etched bronze sign that reads, \"Courtroom.\""
