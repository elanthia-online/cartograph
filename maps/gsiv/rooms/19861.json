    "Limestone walls and columns support a barrel-vaulted roof of fossil-encrusted blocks.  Between the columns, glass-paned large windows line the western walls and provide a view of the well-manicured grounds, while woven reed prayer mats placed before marble-framed alcoves offer quiet places for contemplation."
