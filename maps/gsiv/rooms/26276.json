    "A heavy wooden door bounded by iron-barred windows serves as the entrance into a rock-lined weapon shop.  All manner of undead pass by, their rotting and grotesque forms shambling among a number of multistoried buildings.  Much of this corner of the square is gloomy, shrouded by the shadow of the looming citadel to the south."
