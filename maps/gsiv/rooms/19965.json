    "Painted on the walls is a dense forest scene, the trees so close together that the canopies overlap.  The ceiling is covered with a thick layer of silk leaves, as if the mural on the walls has spilled over into the room itself.  Expansive tree stumps sit in a circle on the grass-green marble floor.  Resting on the each of the tree trunks are wax figures in various poses, while a a double-sided wooden easel in the center of the ring displays several paintings.  Standing in opposite corners are a glass display case and a gilt-edged rowan pedestal."
