  "description": [
    "A weathered wooden walkway leads south from an elaborate wrought iron gate.  To each side, moss spreads amongst flowers ringed by giant cypress and willows.  Far back from the wide walkway can be glimpsed a small house raised up on stilts and a broad platform, while others closer by stand on firmer ground."
