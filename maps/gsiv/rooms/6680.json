    "Racks of weapons line the walls and floors, forming cramped aisles for anyone wishing to traverse this room.  Weapons of every shape and size, of every style imaginable, line the racks awaiting the day they are called into service once again.  All of the weapons are very well crafted, but none of them are of exceptional quality and none of them appear to contain any magical properties.  You also see an iron-bound heavy modwir door."
