    "Crafted from modwir, a circular bar dominates the center of the room, several potted ferns placed about its base.  Scattered throughout are clusters of plump cerulean cushioned chairs and sofas, creating a vibrant contrast to the thick ivory carpet that covers the floor.  A pale modwir bin and a small ceramic basket of sticks rest next to a large stone fireplace built opposite from a velvet-draped arch.  Copper sconces hang on the walls, their etched globes ready to be lit, while a pair of carved oak doors leads out."
