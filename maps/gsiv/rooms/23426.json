    "Mobiles made from colorful pieces of broken glass, seashells, and found bits of polished metal dangle overhead, fracturing the light cast by the oil lamps upon the walls.  Underfoot, a woven rope rug dyed a myriad of vibrant hues sits centered on the floor, and a table made of a broken ship's wheel occupies its heart, supporting a tarnished silver platter, a hole-filled piece of driftwood, and a chipped crystal candy dish."
