  "description": [
    "Moonlight streams through the open roof, illuminating the inside of this snugly built, one-room cabin.  Straw piled in a corner apparently served for a bed, and a large iron stove in the far corner provided the meals.  A short message appears to have been carved onto the doorpost.  In the center of the cabin, suspended from the rafters, hangs the corpse of a man."
