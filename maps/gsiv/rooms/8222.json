    "The size of this cavern is larger than one would have anticipated while making the precarious climb up the wall.  The darkness is pierced by a single shaft of light from a narrow fissure high above.  A faint chirping noise tells you there are bats nesting in lofty aeries overhead.  There is no sign at all of the garbage here, however, so a little bat dung underfoot seems a reasonable exchange.  A large rock slide to the south seems to block further travel on this level."
