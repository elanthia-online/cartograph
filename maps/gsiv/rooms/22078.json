  "description": [
    "The rich smell of many ales lingers in the air above the tables that are positioned around the room.  The smooth glaes top of a teakwood bar reflects the dim lighting of the room.  Behind the bar is a large mirror and racks filled with strange liquors imported from distant lands.  An elegantly framed portrait hangs above the mantle of a glossy obsidian fireplace.  Sounds of gambling and laughter come from a polished marble archway, and a colorful rosewood runestaff carved in the image of a barmaid serving two ales is mounted over the entry."
