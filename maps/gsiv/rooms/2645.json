  "description": [
    "The depths churn with ferocious tenacity, tossing everything within its embrace like leaves caught in a wind.  Directions are difficult to ascertain, and even the brave beams of light filtering down into the morass seem to bend and stretch in response the currents' vicious onslaught.  Through a momentary lull in the flux, the rough surface of the rock wall of the pool is revealed, scarred by pits and depressions."
