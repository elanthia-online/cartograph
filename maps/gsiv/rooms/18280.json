    "Pale moonlight barely seeps through the many layers of branches and leaves to dance lazily across the jungle floor.  Despite the cooling night breezes, the air retains an oppressive heat and the humid conditions leave a sheen of moisture on every surface.  Dashing around the undergrowth, a small vole pauses to take advantage of some water collecting on a fallen leaf.   Situated atop a lush patch of moss, a cluster of violet sundews attempt to lure unsuspecting insects."
