    "[Blue Wisteria Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Painted a soft blue, this table is faded from use and worn smooth along the rounded edge.  Faint stencil work depicting a twining wisteria vine with blue and purple blossoms is still visible on its surface.  Tiny bumblebees hover about the blossoms and a few butterflies rest upon the leaves.  In the center of the table is a crystal bowl filled with wisteria blooms that spill over onto the table in an artful arrangement."
