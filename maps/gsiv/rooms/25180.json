    "Similar to the previous room, tall glass cases are positioned at various points within the room.  Lacking windows, the ebonwood walls are adorned with swathes of silvery gossamer that contrast nicely against the dark hue of the wood.  Silvery undertones sweep the grey marble floors, designed to match not only the gossamer, but also the flickering silver sconces that line the walls.  An arch leads back to the beginning of the museum."
