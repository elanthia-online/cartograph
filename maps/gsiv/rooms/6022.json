    "A huge mound of wheat chaff towers over the weeds that surround it like a huge golden altar before a crowd of worshipping green acolytes.  Thick, tall and prickly, the weeds attempt to prevent approach to the mound.  Mice skitter through the weeds, searching for any remaining wheat, however slight.  The mound's purity is contaminated by the remains of moldy feed corn, wheat stalks, barley plants and decomposing turnip greens."
