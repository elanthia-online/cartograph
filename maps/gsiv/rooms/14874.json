    "Flowering shrubs of all sorts are intermixed with verdant evergreen bushes to create a balanced palette of color to be enjoyed by those wandering the wide dirt path.  Stately oaks and elms fill the open places a bit farther back from the trail, and a glimpse of what looks like a fruit orchard can be seen in the distance."
