  "description": [
    "Vast expanses of ocean and sky meld into the mist that enshrouds the island.  Closer inland, small tidal pools can be seen dotting the beach at the base of the overlook.  Dense and uninviting, the dark jungle looms to the east, a stark contrast to the airy coastal cliffs continuing southward.  Tangy ocean breezes whip across the stubby grass dotting the barren overlook with unusual strength."
