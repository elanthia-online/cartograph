    "A small star-shaped window high on one wall offers the only evidence that the room is above ground.  Long brown feathery roots dangle from the ceiling and pry apart the stone walls through available cracks.  A large crack is located in the center of one wall.  Placed in the center of the room is a workbench covered in a light dusting of dirt from periodic sprinkles of earth from the ceiling."
