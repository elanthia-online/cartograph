    "In the center of a translucent sphere sits a marvelous machine, huge beyond reckoning and more complex than the eye can take in.  Its complicated turns, twists and coils surround a narrow slab of rolaren at the precise heart of both the machine and the sphere.  A few dials can be seen on a dais beside the slab."
