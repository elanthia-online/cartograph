    "The austere surroundings are softened only by a single tapestry hung on the back wall of the shop.  A heavily carved maoral counter rests in front of the tapestry, tended by a tonsured clerk in dark brown robes.  The unremitting dullness of the chamber is allieviated only by a birdcage resting atop the counter, within which a bright yellow canary sings cheerfully."
