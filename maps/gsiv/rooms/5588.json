  "description": [
    "Freestanding shelves, stacked barrels and piles of dry goods all arranged in rows divide the shop into a half dozen aisles where caravaners, adventurers and guildsfolk browse.  A Dark Elven woman whose build resembles more that of an overgrown Halfling than any kind of Elf waits on customers at a counter along the back wall."
