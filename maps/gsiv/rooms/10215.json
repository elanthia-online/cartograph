    "The bleached, half-buried skull of a large feline shows starkly against the dark soil of the field.  An industrious spider has woven her webs around the skull and the silken threads tremble with each passing breeze like shivering gossamer flesh on the creature's long dead bone.",
    "The bleached, half-buried skull of a large feline shows ghostly pale against the darker soil of the field.  Black shadowed eye holes peer up blankly at the deep night sky."
