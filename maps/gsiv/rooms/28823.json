  "description": [
    "A vine-covered wood suspension bridge spans the void between the plateau and another one nearby in the inky expanse of the cavern.  Though once comprised of wood and rope, creeping parasitic vines have trained themselves along the guide ropes, and in some places, appear to have replaced them entirely.  The green of the vines is peculiar in a lightless place, but no more so than the dramatically red, trumpet-shaped flowers blossoming along their length."
