  "description": [
    "Hanging across the rear wall of the alcove, a heavy tapestry woven in vibrantly rich colors is illuminated by the filtered light from an arched glaesine window.  It displays a panorama, a vista that shows an immense range of mountains, with deep dells and resplendent waterfalls overseen by vast and lordly peaks.  Overhead, the ceiling is marked with the pattern of immense wings."
