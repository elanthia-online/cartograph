    "Stacks of barrels and crates have been cleverly positioned to shield this area from prying eyes, creating a safe haven in the chaos of the cargo hold of the vessel.  A single oil lantern sits atop an overturned treasure chest, providing feeble light to the niche.  Several barrels lie scattered among random piles of pilfered goods."
