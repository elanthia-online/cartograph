    "A small building flanks the entrance to a long wooden pier that flows out into the lake, its arched blue-tiled roof and pale white walls chased with loops of lustrous silver.  A grouping of slender ivory-hued boats is arranged upon either side of the pier, each bobbing gently to the rhythm of the water's soft ripples.  Glimmering jewels of sunlight dance upon the surface of the water, resembling a cascade of liquid gold.",
