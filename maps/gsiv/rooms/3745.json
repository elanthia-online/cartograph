    "Rough hewn blue-grey granite blocks line the facade of this tiny shop, an edging of feldspar trimming the paned windows.  Oak flower boxes filled with a variety of colorful native flowers prove to be a magnet for a myriad of butterflies and industrious bees.  A bright periwinkle blue-painted oak door bearing a small oval gold sign leads into the shop, while a slate walkway leads back to the main street.",
