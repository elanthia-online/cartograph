    "The trail winds through a stand of stately oaks, their lowest branches high above even the tallest of giantmen.  Rhododendrons crouch at the feet of the mighty ones, their foliage a green so dark, it appears black in shadows.  The ground is covered in a deep carpet of leaves, which the elements have rendered into a subtle and beautiful mottle of colors.  A few cabins blend seamlessly with the landscape, nestled within the protection of the oaks."
