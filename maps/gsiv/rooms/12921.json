  "description": [
    "Smoothed stone and granite, with a polished wood trim and a fresh layer of paint, forms a large storefront on the southwestern corner of the street.  A series of shops and stores flank it to the north and east, dotting the road in an orderly fashion.  No signs adorn the doors or walls, however, and no single shop appears to be entertaining a large number of customers."
