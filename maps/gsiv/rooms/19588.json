    "Spanning the distance between the cobblestone paths, the bridge arches high over a small stream that is speckled with water lilies.  Bright orange and white koi swim through the clear waters at one end, while the other creates a melodic sound as it passes through rocks and reeds.  Lampposts mark the center of structure, their glaesine windows reflecting the sunlight in a myriad of colors upon the smooth wooden planks.",
    "Spanning the distance between the cobblestone paths, the bridge arches high over a small stream that is speckled with water lilies.  Silvery moonlight sparkles upon the clear waters briefly illuminating dark shadows at one end, while the other creates a melodic sound as it passes through rocks and reeds.  Lampposts mark the center of structure, their glaesine windows shedding round pools of light upon the smooth wooden planks."
