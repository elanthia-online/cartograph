  "description": [
    "A rock wall, about the height of a human man, though only a few paces in length, stands inexplicably alone, neither bordering nor enclosing anything.  A large circle of wooden sticks poke out from in between the spaces of the rocks.  Inside the circle, painted upon the face of the rock wall, is the image of a silver-haired woman driving a chariot pulled by two grey stallions."
