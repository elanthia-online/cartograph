  "description": [
    "Covered with a rich, cinereal wool carpet, the marbled alabaster floor melds smoothly with the walls, veins of crimson contrasting with their immaculate surface.  A large ebon marble fireplace dominates the room, a basket of sticks resting at its base.  A number of small meeting tables are set along the perimeter, and a dark sideboard has been placed to the side, its surface covered with various bowls and platters."
