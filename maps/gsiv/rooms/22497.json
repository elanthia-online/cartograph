    "Layers of pale grey silk drape from a canopied oak frame to create the walls of this pavilion, broken only by a beaded ebon silk curtain.  A small black oak table stands centered on a thick wool carpet.  Frosted crystal globes are suspended from fine silver chains, their light illuminating the small area."
