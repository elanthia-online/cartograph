    "Lit by the candlelight that filters in from the mouth of the drainpipe, the floor is revealed to have long gone dry.  The curved metal has begun to rust, revealing the mottled stone and earthen surface underneath.  One particular hole in the curved wall gapes like an open mouth in the dim lighting.  The other end of the pipe terminates in a landslide of rocks, dirt, and debris."
