    "Earthy tones dominate the interior of this small wagon.  A plush rug woven in a twining vine pattern covers the floor, a small modwir rack resting in the middle of it.  A vivid tapestry in variegated shades of green and blue covers the back wall, the swirling colors highlighting a long branch that serves as a shelf.  A small stool rests near a worktable in the corner, the surface covered with bits of leather and cloth."
