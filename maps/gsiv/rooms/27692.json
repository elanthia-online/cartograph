  "description": [
    "Pale blue paint mimics the summer sky, and white-curtained windows add a touch of color to the sky-hued walls, along with a single full-length mirror.  Several sapphire blue oil lanterns burn in niches and release a saltwater scent into the air.  Near the windows and illuminated by sunlight, a sign rests on a white metal stand, while several attendants dressed in seafoam hues mill about the room.  A pale tan-striped curtain occasionally stirs in breezes let in through the windows."
