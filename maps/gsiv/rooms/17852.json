    "Several tables shaded by umbrellas are visible through a latticed partition in the north wall that looks out into a sunlit garden area.  Though most of the tables are unoccupied, intrepid songbirds occasionally flit down to forage for crumbs left by previous diners.",
    "The view through a latticed opening in the northern wall reveals a moonlit dining area set amidst a well-tended garden.  Two heavily cloaked figures sit at the table that is farthest removed from your vantage point, apparently having a rather clandestine meeting."
