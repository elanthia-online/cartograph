    "Simple wooden teller windows fitted with glaes panes stand open to service the many Aelotoi men and women bustling about.  A domed skylight allows sunshine to stream in, glinting off the silver coins being transferred, withdrawn, and deposited.  Vivid butterflies have been painted flitting across the pale pink and blue-tinted stone walls."
