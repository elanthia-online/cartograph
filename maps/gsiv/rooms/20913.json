    "Though higher than much of the surrounding valley, this small glade stands lower than the distant jungle.  Foothills of various heights mark the crumbling edge of a towering mountain.  The only access across the fast-moving depths of a freshwater river to the northeast is a climb down some snarled banyan roots.  The cirque's slope continues through dense vegetation."
