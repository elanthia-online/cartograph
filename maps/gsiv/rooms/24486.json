  "description": [
    "The acrid scent of one too many spilled potions permeates the workshop, competing with the faint wax smell from what seems to be hundreds of burning candles.  Their light eases the stark midnight black of the enchanting circle carved into the flagstone floor.  A mithril-bound workbench is bolted to the north wall, its surface covered with empty vials and beakers, scorch marks and a copy of an elementary text on enchanting."
