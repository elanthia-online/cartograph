    "A gold and crimson wyvern tapestry hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A serene golden wyvern fountain sits in one corner of a swirled sea glass floor.  There is a floral-etched ceramic case on one side of the shop and a low wrought iron table on the other."
