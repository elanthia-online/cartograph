  "description": [
    "Curtains of grey lace drape heavily across the arched windows of the shop, preventing the outside light from penetrating the room.  A quartet of alabaster mannequins dominate the ebonwood floor, the faceless models posed as though gazing upwards towards the jet-beaded chandelier set high above.  The faint scent of flora wafts from tall marbled vases at each corner of the shop, the dried rose and mournbloom petals scattered listlessly about the area."
