    "Men and women of various races cross back and forth through the courtyard, sparring under the watchful eye of a stout dwarf standing atop a large wood block.  The covered walkway extends along the border of the courtyard, providing shade and shelter to several archways and doorways that open out on to the courtyard.  Along a wall that extends westwards towards the main gate are lined a series of dummies built to resemble orcs, goblins, and other fiends."
