    "A glimpse over the railing reveals only a handful of citizens and visitors wandering about the hall at this hour.  A sleepy toddler, clearly ready for bedtime, waddles beside an older male human who looks perplexed as he speaks to a young halfling page.  On this level, the stark white wall here is interspersed equidistantly with thick cedar logs that support the structural integrity of the building and dome overhead."
