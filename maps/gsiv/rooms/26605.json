    "Pale blue carpeting muffles extraneous noise between the staterooms lining the companionway, but sounds of dishes, glassware, and muted conversations drift in from a pair of heavy mahogany doors trimmed in brass which stand open at the aft end of the passage.  The swaying of brass lanterns suspended from the ceiling lends a rhythmic undulation of light back and forth across the teak panelled walls."
