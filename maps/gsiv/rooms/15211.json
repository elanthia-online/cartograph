    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a carved ebonwood dinghy.  Halfway to the tiled ceiling, a iron-hooked split oak oar hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls.  A plank-covered barrel table and a slender driftwood counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
