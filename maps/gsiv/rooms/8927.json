    "Unexpectedly warm air fills the broad hallway and provides a welcome respite from the harsh artic winds outside.  A constant flow of mist falls from an icy arch as warm air filled with the scent of tropical flowers makes contact.  Torches along each wall illuminate lifelike murals that depict a realistic courtyard with a fountain.  The murals look so real that one could easily imagine faint sounds of splashing water coming from the paintings."
