    "Carved mahogany frames the ceiling above, with an elaborate maritime mural spanning the entirety of the space within.  Wine-hued velvet hangs in scallops at the upper edges of the walls, while cherry wood wainscoting trims the lower half in a subtle, but stylish contrast to the mahogany walls.  A half-circle counter at the head of the room boasts a display showcasing a variety of glasses, and dark leather-cushioned chairs and side tables are spread throughout the lounge."
