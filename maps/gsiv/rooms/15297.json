    "Celadon marble walls rise from a dark-stained oak floor.  Just above a bronzed drake sculpture hangs a portrait of Darkstone Castle, and a mistwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A vine-carved mahogany table and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
