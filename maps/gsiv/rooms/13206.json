    "Lush deep red carpet stretches the length of the hall's floor, and portraits of the House's founders line the granite walls.  A small engraved plaque is hung at eye level for all to see.  Nestled in the center of the hall, an ebonwood balcony overlooks the Hall of Dreadnaught and its dominating griffin sculpture.  At the far end of the hall, a winding staircase leading to a heavy black iron door gives access to the tower, while a spiral stairway leads down to the ground floor."
