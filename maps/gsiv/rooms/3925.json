  "description": [
    "Two massive arches span the chamber, their lintels covered with ragged glyphs.  Fog shifts and drifts through, like ghostly wanderers lost in the immensity of half-light embraced by the doorways' curves.  A light sand covers the floor, heaped up against the stone walls in places.  Indentions of footprints pock the sand, leaving winding patterns in it with varying shapes and depths."
