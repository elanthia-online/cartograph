    "Brilliant rainbows arc in all directions around a sculpture consisting of hundreds of crystals that act as tiny prisms.  Surrounding the sculpture, six white canvases stretch between poles, capturing the color and creating a living, moving painting of light.  Tourists from all over the lands come to sit and watch the kinetic symphony."
