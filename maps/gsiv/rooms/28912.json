  "description": [
    "Dusty portholes and a swinging front door are part of a weathered shack with a battered metal roof which is built in the center of a crushed seashell lot along one side of the narrow avenue, while small cottages and shacks reside along the sloping opposite side.  Dog rose bushes with bright pink blossoms lend their heady fragrance to the salty sea breeze that trickles through the area.  A broken lantern rests on its side in the dirt and dust."
