  "description": [
    "Three walkways lead from openings in the ornately decorated cast-iron fencing, all converging upon the grand entrance to the Bard Guild Theater.  Well-tended lawn and bountiful flower beds intermingle with overarching trees.  Star-shaped paving stones create an expansive terrace below the marquee, framing the large, delicately carved doors.  Above the marquee, on a gilded sign hanging from a pole and supported by black chains, shine the words \"Terrace Theater.\""
