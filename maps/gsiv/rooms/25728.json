    "Surrounded by a low wooden fence, the enclosure has piles of pale, yellow hay in one corner that create a bed for the plump brown baby rolton that wanders about.  Large troughs provide the fat beast with plenty of water, and the emerald green grass that spreads across the ground offers a constant supply of food.  Zoo workers stand near the open gate, allowing patrons to pet the tiny creature, while also blocking it from escaping."
