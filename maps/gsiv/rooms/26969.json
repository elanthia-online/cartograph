    "Crushed seashells scatter across the circular court before trailing away to various places in the garden, their pathways lined with frosted lanterns and bright white pebbles.   Constructed of white birch, an ornate pergola occupies the center and is encircled by a ring of gently burbling water, it's source unknown.  Wisteria vines fashioned of enameled copper trail across the structure and twine with faenor-leafed rose vines, beneath which an alluring copper statue stands."
