  "description": [
    "Two toadstools in brass pots flank a long, low, stone slab, their dim light pooling over the hard slab.  The scent of embalming chemicals permeates the room, though it is heaviest near a metal cupboard affixed to one wall.  A tarnished metal sign hangs next to the cupboard.  The lack of much else in the room seems to cause even the slightest of noises to echo loudly off the granite walls and encourages one to speak in whispers."
