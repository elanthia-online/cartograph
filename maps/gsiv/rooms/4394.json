    "A large, tattered tapestry depicting a battlefield scene, banners and flags hoisted high, is the only attempt at decoration in this rectangular chamber.  Just below the tapestry, a small stone-topped counter chiseled with a large \"I\" in the center, rests amid pebbles and a thin layer of dust."
