  "description": [
    "In stunning contrast to the somewhat dull scenery below, the summit is a vivid study in color and light.  Large rectangular talismans carved from pale grey granite ring the edges of the summit, like sentries guarding the precious grounds of this jewel among the heavens.  Sunlight pierces through the clouds overhead, warming your aching bones, and carrying with it a faint promise of brighter days ahead.  Set in the exact center of the circle, a tall octagonal building with an arch of pure granite beckons.",
