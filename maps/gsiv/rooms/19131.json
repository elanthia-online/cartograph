  "description": [
    "Filled with boxes and crates of all shapes and sizes, this small storage room is cramped and hard to maneuver in.  Several racks of goods are displayed along the back wall, while a barrel is filled with supplies ready for use rests underneath.  Scratched from years of use, a crudely made worktable is piled with a variety of raw materials and tools.  A blanketed archway leads back towards the entry."
