    "In the center of the room, an elaborate diorama has been set apart from the walkway by velvet ropes.  Against one darkly paneled wall, a long glass case houses several artifacts from the founding of Wehnimer's Landing and related events of that era.  Glass-paned oil lanterns light the room from their hooks on the walls, affording the space a cozy golden glow."
