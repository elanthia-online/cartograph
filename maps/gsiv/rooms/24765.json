    "This room radiates a warm and inviting atmosphere, a mood which is helped by the fire glowing in the large stone fireplace set in the middle of the far wall.  In front of the fireplace basks a large panther skin rug, its black surface shining in the firelight.  Across the polished oak floor is an extremely cluttered desk.  Next to the desk rests a large mahogany bed."
