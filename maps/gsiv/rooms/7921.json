  "description": [
    "Heat radiates off the rock faces that have been baked in the sun during the day.  Cool air tries to steal the stored warmth but the mass of rocks holds it in.  The contrast in temperature causes the air to swirl in highly chaotic patterns forming small shadows of dust that dance above the canyon floor with the appearance of small, drunken ghosts.",
    "Rays of sunlight almost make it to the floor here as they bake the outcrop of rock that splits the canyons.  The sunlight is in sharp contrast to the cool air that swirls about forming little dust devils that dance above the canyon floor.  A worn crack in the eastern face of the outcrop stands out against the jagged edges that guard the rest of the rockface."
