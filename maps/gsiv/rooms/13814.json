    "The bluff drops away in a sheer cliff, offering a spectacular view of the lake over the tops of trees in the lee of the hillside below.  Oaks grow tall along the hillside, reaching up hundreds of feet into the air.  At their feet, cottages nestle in the protection of the trees, bordered by thick beds of ferns and rhododendrons."
