    "Dark oak walls enclose the brightly lit room, offering plenty of light to the cramped entryway.  A large mahogany counter stands before an iron-hinged oak door, which has a granite plaque hanging from the doorsill.  A gold-edged, scarlet rug barely covers the dusty floors of the wagon, which branch off to the east and west."
