    "The wooden platform supporting this space juts straight out of the trunk of the nearby colossal teak tree.  Soft golden wavering light from the sun pokes down through the leaves above, casting shadows that dance playfully around this secluded area.  A long twisting branch crosses the center of the room with some sanded-down twigs in a neat row sticking out of it.  A triangular gap in the thick twisting foliage heads out to the main platform, while a narrow plank leads east.",
