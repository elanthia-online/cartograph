    "You are on the edge of the glacier.  The ground here is hard-packed ice, slippery beneath your feet, but the halflings seem not to notice as they make their way about their business.  Houses have been carved from the ice, as have a few small shops.  A ramp of packed, grated ice leads up and to the east, likely to the Temple."
