    "Lined with bronze, a circular fire pit dominates the room, a basket of wood placed to the side.  The wooden walls shine, their lacquered surface polished and gleaming in the moonlight.  Several stone benches line the walls between a crimson curtained arch and an indigo curtained arch, warm air circulating all about."
