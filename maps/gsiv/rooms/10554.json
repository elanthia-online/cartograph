  "description": [
    "A piercing whistle reverberates through the area, drowning out all other sound.  The ground slopes slightly and the thick grass is slick and treacherous.  A single bleached, jagged bone is set into the ground and tethered to the bone is a small piece of thick blue material, flapping in the light breeze."
