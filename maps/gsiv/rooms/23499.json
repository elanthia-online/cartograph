    "Scrappy carpet only partially covers the floor, its threadbare edges only covering the entrance to the area and a small pathway up to a clerk's cage.  The remainder of the flooring is made up of moist, wooden planking that appears as if it might give way at any moment.  Pushed up against each wall, several dimly lit tables, with nary a chair in sight, are scattered atop discarded tickets."
