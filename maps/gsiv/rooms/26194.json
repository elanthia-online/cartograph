    "[Scrappy Scallop Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Scallop shells swirl out from the center of the table in a spiral pattern, but they haven't been set cleanly and sharp irregularities protrude.  Larger shells, several feet in diameter, are lined up on the booth's sides separating it from the others.  A sea scallop in the center of the table serves as a vase."
