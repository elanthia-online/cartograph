    "Plain whitewashed walls and a wood beam ceiling enclose this space, clearly utilitarian in nature.  Shelves fitted to the walls are stacked high with folded blankets of fur, accompanied by pillows of various sizes covered in soft and luxurious fabrics.  A few pieces of furniture sit covered in canvas drop cloths.  On the south wall of the room is a small oak door."
