  "description": [
    "Knee-high, greenish-black carpets of moss cling to fallen trees and rocks, their fibrous tendrils spreading upward towards the dank sky.  Stagnant pools, covered with frothing yellowish scum, fill the air with the pungent aroma of rot and decay.  An oppressive dampness lays heavy upon the area, and with the lack of natural lighting, it causes the air to be thick and chilled."
