  "description": [
    "Thick vines and overgrowth drape from the tall gaunt trees, the foliage brushing at the still surface water pooled beneath them.  Fallen logs allow passage over the morass of bubbling mud.  Acidic vapors rise up into the air with the rupture of each bubble, releasing a pungent odor.  An ethereal green light, casting flickering apparitions against the vapors, spreads out from the site of an granite headstone that rests on a slow incline."
