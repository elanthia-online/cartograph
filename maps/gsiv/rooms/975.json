    "Rabbit tracks emerge from the pines to circle several small bushes then dart away into the depths of the forest.  The small impressions in the snow show no sign of pursuit by a predator.  The road bends slightly, moving off to the south and northeast.  Although covered in snow, the road is flat and passage is easy.  Just to the north, a huge blue spruce stands out among the darker pines and firs.  The spruce's fragrant aroma fills the air.",
