  "description": [
    "Frosted glass lanterns hanging from the ceiling glow with a soft pink light, reflecting off an assortment of pure and holy symbols and adornments strung from the walls.  Garlands of flowers in various stages of bloom adorn a small side table here and there, while a square cedar table bordered by miniature hearts takes up most of the center of the area.  The scent of early spring wafts about the room, coming from an unseen source."
