    "[Flighty Flute Table]"

  "description": [
    "A cylindrical table sits near the southern wall of the tavern.  Its sienna marble surface is polished to a fine sheen, and two rectangular supports hold it aloft.  One end of the table flares, while the other end tapers down to a notched slit.  The most prominent aspect of the table, though, are the two wings that protrude, one each, from either side of the center of the table.  Several stone chairs crowd around the table, perhaps in an attempt to keep it from taking flight."
