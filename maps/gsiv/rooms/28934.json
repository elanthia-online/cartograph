    "A variety of statuary crowd one corner of the tent, with a pile of jewelry on a nearby table.  A tall vivid purple octopus bejeweled with glittery dust takes center stage, one engorged tentacle nestled within the side of a cracked crate holding armaments.  Near a curtain of colorful glass beads, crates filled with imbeddables and miscellaneous items are pushed to the side to make a path."
