    "Twists of silver lace spin through the night-darkened glass of the dome overhead, forming a pattern reminiscent of a whelk's shell that casts twisting shadows over a crescent-shaped landing sprouting from the tower wall.  Stairs glide up and down from the landing, carved of the same gold-veined white marble as the landing.  A velvet rope prevents further progress upwards.  Twin columns of alabaster that match the material and hue of the walls.  They border a stained cherrywood door in the western wall."
