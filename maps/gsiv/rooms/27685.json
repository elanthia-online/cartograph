    "This tiny office looks to be under construction.  Crates, coffers, and sealed strongboxes have been left in organized stacks with parchments attached to them.  Various officials parade in and out making deliveries and removing existing goods.  A black-bordered list on one wall draws your attention, while the rest of the office is largely empty."
