    "Pickle paraphernalia occupies almost the entirety of this cramped booth.  Several different mannequins line the back wall of the booth; to the right are a gnome and halfling mannequins, while to the left are their medium-sized and giantman counterparts.  A large green pickle-shaped sign stands between the displays."
