    "This small garden has been meticulously tended, each shrub is carefully pruned and each vibrant flower is in full bloom.  A quaint cobblestone path leads over to a small hut which is hardly noticeable next to the much larger dome-shaped structure.  Atop the hut is a tiny chimney, from which a steady stream of smoke rises."
