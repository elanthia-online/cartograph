    "The perfection of the beautiful ruby floor is broken here in the southwest corner of Fangthryn's Cavern.  Tiles are marked with savage rents and discolored with dark stains.  A particularly violent disruption leaves broken pieces of the floor slabs protruding from the rock of the wall, as if they were impelled into it by some sort of explosion.  Where the tiles are unaligned, gaps reveal a fine-grained, black sand lying beneath."
