    "The wood and stone back walls of the surrounding buildings form a spacious, elongated courtyard that extends to the west through the middle of the block.  Most of the snow has been cleared away by the constant passing of trampling feet, and a few hardy evergreen vines add spots of green to the grey and brown of the frosty walls."
