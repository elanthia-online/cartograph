  "description": [
    "A life-size invar statue watches vigilantly from a darkened corner, flanked by fully stocked weapon racks.  Tiny potted cacti with bold yellow flowers sit along each windowsill, offering a splash of color to an otherwise drab office.  Neatly stacked with parchments and scrolls, the varnished mahogany desk of the Warden faces a mithril-bound arch that offers a clear line of sight to the very back of the prison."
