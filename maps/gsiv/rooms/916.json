    "The air in the cavern is thick and heavy, its mixture of trapped odors almost overpowering.  The sharp, lively scent of swiftly flowing water has combined with the dank odor of deep, unexplored grottos to produce a fragrance that is both invigorating, as well as repulsive.  Those who are alien to these vast, dark regions do not take long to yearn for the light of the surface."
