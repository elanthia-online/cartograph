    "You run into a post and stumble back, almost falling to the ground.  Approaching more cautiously, you discover a line of thin posts set across the passage.  You explore one with your hands, but jerk back when you find a half-rotted skull impaled at the top.  You can probably squeeze between the posts if you're careful."
