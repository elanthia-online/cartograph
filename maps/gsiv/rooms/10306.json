    "The lattice walkway overlooks the courtyard below, with its huge fountain, flowering bushes and honeysuckle hedge.  The top of the fountain is approximately at the same height as the walkway's surface, so the fountain's piping, wheels, doors, and other intricacies are readily visible.  Directly to the north, a carved walnut door allows entrance to one of the Rest's sleeping rooms, and a polished stairway with plush, carpeted steps provides a descent to the level below."
