    "Grey and smooth, large standing stones tower over the area, their shadows elongated upon the black sands as the sun moves about the sky.  Tufts of new grass, some high and willowy while others are short and ungregarious, occupy the northern edge, where bone white foundation stones glimmer in the sunlight.  A faded pathway, slowly giving over to new growth, cuts a straight path through the grasses and into the north.",
