    "Woodland Lane branches off of Highpark Lane with a small pond marking the demarcation.  From the pond's center spurts a fountain, its diminutive arc creating a gentle cascade of falling water.  To the north, as the lane travels between noble residences, twin rows of graceful Illistim maples provide a leafy canopy overhead.",
