    "A tiled walkway leads from the main entrance across a well-trimmed, half-oval lawn towards three large arched entrances of a white marble building.  The columns supporting the covered walkway are carved with the forms of beautiful maidens, their hands uplifted to touch the ceiling while their delicate feet dangle from the base."
