    "A bare space has been cleared out of the surrounding bramble and branch, though around the edges the vegetation has already grown back in threatening tangles and bursts of spikes.  One side of the small clearing backs up against the exterior of a temporary shack, the interior of which is accessible through a canvas curtain."
