    "Several granite benches are positioned directly in front of the intricately carved marble fountain, surrounded by a small field of flowers in full bloom.  Someone's initials are chiseled into the side of one of the benches, surrounded by a perfectly carved heart.  The tranquil gurgling of the fountain is relaxing as you take in the garden scene."
