    "Set high up in the outside wall, a single narrow lancet window allows crimson-hued natural light to flood the interior of the workroom.  A solid, nearly immovable workbench occupies the majority of the floor space.  Several workstations are set up around the granite workbench, each neatly fitted with a translucent glass alembic, a crucible, and a silver gem lens assembly."
