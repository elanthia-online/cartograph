    "A wooden bench has been placed next to a small window in the south wall.  It looks out over the bluff the temple sits upon and across the huge range of mountains.  Far to the west, sitting high on one of the mountains, you think you can make out a large castle, but the clouds obscuring the peak make it difficult to tell.",
