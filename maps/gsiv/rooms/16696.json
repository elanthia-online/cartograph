    "Fine oak panels carved with a floral pattern make up the walls in this small but quaint little office.  A dark walnut desk sits in a back corner sandwiched by two short filing cabinets, each adorned with a potted plant.  A couple of polished brass lanterns keep this room brightly lit and an old worn throw rug covers the floor."
