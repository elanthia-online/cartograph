    "Flying high at the tower's apex is a black-crested flag.  The stones ringing the tower's perch are tall enough to offer some protection from the elements and other assaults.  Spaced between the stones are slits wide enough for lookouts and archers to easily assess the surrounding ground.  Sturdy ebony barrels are strategically placed between the slits, giving easy access to arrows in times of siege.  The rotating ballista dominates the area with its ominous presence."
