    "At the bluff's farthest reach east, the ravelin's commanding position is made clear in the view from the perimeter wall.  The Mistydeep's green-blue waters meander from the northern forests to the marble walls of Ta'Vaalor in the south.  Near the wall, a signal tower rises thirty feet on basalt blocks with steps carved into them.  Atop the tower, a stack of wood is ready to be lit at any moment.  A pair of vigilant elven recruits stand guard over a small, lit brazier with tar-soaked torches nearby."
