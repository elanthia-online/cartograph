    "This barbican provides a highly defensible access to the castle's outer ward, surrounded as it is by the lake's water and flanked by crenelated towers.  The drawbridge approach to the stone structure boasts a machicoulis as well as a huge portcullis, standing open and secured by an iron chain as big around as a young roa'ter.  On the castle side, a stone bridge that connects the barbican to the castle leads to another lake traverse -- via a stone bridge -- which grants entrance to Castle Anwyn's impressive curtain wall."
