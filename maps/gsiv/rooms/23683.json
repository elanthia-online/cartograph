    "Draped in flower laden vines, the north end of a wooden building is barely seen under the thick verdant blanket.  Covered in large white flowers, a row of elephant ear bushes line the path.  Several balsawood trees provide shade over the area, their outstretched branches mingling with the cedar tree to the south to create a thick canopy over the lawn."
