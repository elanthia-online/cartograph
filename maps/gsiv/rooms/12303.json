    "Bright windows shed golden light upon the broad expanse of a nearby table that is positioned in the center of the kitchen beneath a series of clustered copper lanterns.  Several oak barrel chairs surround the table's oblong bulk, though one rests near a simple woodstove.  A wide soapstone sink is flanked by smooth counters with bright cabinets of dark blue hanging above."
