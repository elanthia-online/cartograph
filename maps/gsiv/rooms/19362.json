  "description": [
    "Encircled by a white picket fence, the small courtyard is lined in bright white cobblestones that converge upon a decorative white marble fountain.  Bright tropical blossoms and potted palm trees create a pleasant backdrop on the outer edges, while white benches are arranged at various angles to allow readers their choice of places to recline.  A double-wide entry leads into the library, which is decorated with large windows framed by bright white shutters."
