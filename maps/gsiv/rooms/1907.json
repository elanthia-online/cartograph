    "The south side of Stone Circle is the busiest intersection in the neighborhood, a traffic officer taking post during the busiest hours to help with directions to and from the baths.  Merchants, although unwelcome in this otherwise unassuming neighborhood, hawk every imaginable impossible cure from the marble steps on the north side of the street."
