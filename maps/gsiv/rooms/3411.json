    "Light from the fireplace near the end of the room causes shadows to dance merrily across the plain stone walls.  Rugs and furs line the ground, providing further insulation from the harsh conditions outside.  Near the heavy door is a squat white clerk's counter and before the fireplace is a blue-cushioned bench."
