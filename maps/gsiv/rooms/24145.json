    "Painted murals cover all four walls of this chamber, showing images of a path winding through a forest to the edge of a clear pool.  Tall candelabras hold several white taper candles filling the room with their warm glow and a light fresh air scent.  In the center, a large ceramic vessel sits adjacent to a round white marble slab on a black pedestal."
