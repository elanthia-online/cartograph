    "Wrapped from base to top, nearby support posts are decorated with black rope.  The same braided hemp pieces are stretched out between each to make a low railing that sways in the light seaborne breeze.  A small sign proclaiming \"Pier 2 - Slips 11-15\" is propped against a set of steps that leads down to a finger pier with five docking slips built against its smooth sides."
