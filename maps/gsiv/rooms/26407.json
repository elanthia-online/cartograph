  "description": [
    "The swamp foliage is thinner here than that to the west, and a wide expanse of water can be seen to the east.  Tiny streams flow beneath the raised pine walkway, joining forces with others meandering in from the riverbank.  The noxious stench of swamp gas fades, replaced by the sweet smell of fresh air billowing in from the open waters.  Moonlight pierces the night cloud cover, bathing the swaying rushes in a pale silver glow."
