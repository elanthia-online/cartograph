  "description": [
    "The dark cavern's cool air carries a musty scent of damp wood and stone.  Torches along the rough stone walls offer just enough flame to blacken the craggy ceiling above them.  Obsidian black water surrounds a pair of weathered wooden docks that terminate at large fel-framed doors crudely carved into the cavern wall.  An old, tethered rowboat facing the cavern mouth occasionally draws near its anchor post and knocks against it."
