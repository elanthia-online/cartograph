    "The path doglegs, diverted by a small stream which trickles through a jumble of boulders and fallen tree trunks.  The watercourse is negligible, its edges encased in crystals of ice, and its path often lost in drifts of snow which cover it like thick white bridges.  It parallels the path briefly, then veers off and disappears around a stand of dogwood."
