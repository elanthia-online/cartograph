    "An enormous tree lays across the path, crushed vegetation splayed out beneath the trunk.  Jagged splinters protrude through thick crusts of mud and moss, and the pale roots of a sapling form a knotted mesh over the stump.  The bark is covered in shelf fungus and mushrooms while darkened areas show where the wood has long since rotted away.  To the northwest, a lake of thick, roiling mud inhibits passage."
