    "A heavy coat of fresh sawdust covers the aspen plank flooring, thrown down in an attempt to soak up pools of mud, dung, and spilled ale.  Rough-hewn boards laid across bales of straw provide temporary seating at the rear of the stands, while the front has been roped-off and arranged with cushioned benches and high-backed chairs, a menacing-looking guard posted at the entrance.  A royal blue banner stitched with a golden serpent hangs overhead, the eye of the serpent set with a polished lapis stone."
