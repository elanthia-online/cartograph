    "Dwarves in mining attire move constantly through the tunnel to the south.  Those approaching look dusty and weary, while those walking away are cleaner and in much better spirits.  Occasionally slight tremors shake the floor, but the cause of these is indeterminate.  A narrow, grey stone doorway in the southeast wall leads into a rather official-looking building.  A pick-and-shovel insignia looms over the doorway."
