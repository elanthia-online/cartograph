    "As the corridor proceeds to the north, the color of the tiled floor darkens from rosy-pink to a more vibrant shade in the red spectrum.  The gradation is very gradual and even, and considering the size and irregularity of the slabs, an impressive construction.  A pronounced change in the trail's direction is punctuated by a sharply edged, triangular wall of stone sitting in the center of the turnabout."
