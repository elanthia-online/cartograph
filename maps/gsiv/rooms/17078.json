    "Large and square, the room has durable walls built of oak and fitted with small glass windows.  High above, through a series of rafters, the ceiling of sailcloth is bound tightly to the walls and muffles all outside sounds.  Cubicles marked by small divider screens line the walls and are fitted with rush-filled box beds, footlockers, and wardrobes.  Some of the cubicles house comfortable chairs that display individual character, while others are sparse and uninhabited."
