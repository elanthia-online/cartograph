    "The narrow road ends here in the courtyard of a rambling structure that appears to be a prosperous inn.  The thanot door keeps the guests safe from the dangers of weather and creature.  The footprints that mark the dirt don't look like they were made by anyone you'd care to meet on a moonlit stroll, making the inn a welcome haven."
