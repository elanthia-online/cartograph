    "The cobblestone avenue rings a courtyard, where large terra cotta urns hold small, decorative trees and cascades of flowering vines.  Tables and chairs are set beneath a trellis covered with grapevines.  Houses sit nestled in the garden setting, adding as much charm as the flowering ornamentation."
