    "Balconies hang over the alley, compounding the cramped feeling created by the narrow passage.  While the doors are not flung open to welcome the passing crowds, occasional calls from above catch the attention of recognized locals.  An occasional splash of color can be spied along the rooftops, marking the perimeter of gardens tended in the only available space.",
