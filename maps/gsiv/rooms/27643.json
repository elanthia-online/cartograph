    "[Twilight Tower, Courtyard]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "You find yourself in a walled courtyard of an ornate stone tower.  Despite the lack of vegetation, the area is cozy, with rock formations carved into likenesses of bushes and trees.  The stony flora and walls provide much needed shade and shelter from the constantly blowing wind.  A red cinder rock walkway winds its way to a portcullis, through which you see a long, circular stairway leading up to the top of the tower.",
