  "description": [
    "The rough cut basalt blocks that form the walls of this small chamber seem to soak up the light, leaving nothing for your eyes to settle on except the large, crimson cloisonne brazier in the center of the room and the square of open sky above.  A brassbound felwood torch burns steadily in a gold wall bracket to the right of the brazier, and a crimson leather oilskin set with small gold keys hangs from a hook below the torch."
