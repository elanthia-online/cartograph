    "From the edge of the awning, several pieces of cloth dangle, fluttering on the slightest breeze.  Some simply look to be spare strips of fabric, while others are actually pieces of ribbon.  Along the front of the counter, a swag of beads threaded on lengths of string has been hung, and a long wooden table sits beneath.  On top of the counter, a shallow wooden box lid serves as a makeshift container for a variety of wares."
