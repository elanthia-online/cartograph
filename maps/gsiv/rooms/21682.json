  "description": [
    "Stretching the width of the building, and painted in cool blue and green hues, the room is organized with several rows of neatly made bunk-beds.  Two trunks flank each bed for personal belongings, but otherwise the room is scarcely furnished.  A few chairs are scattered about, and a tall bookcase with a small selection of history books stands before the balustrade separating the stairway from the room.  A brightly painted door leads to a large washroom."
