  "description": [
    "Very little light breaks through the darkness that envelopes the room, its windowless walls painted a pitch black.  The smallest glow flickers from inside a tank in the corner filled with murky water, ripples on the surface evidence of something inside.  Shelves neatly lined with jars and bottles cover the far wall, their contents unrecognizable in the gloom."
