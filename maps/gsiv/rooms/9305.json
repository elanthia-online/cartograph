  "description": [
    "Half shaded by a canvas awning, the workyard is crowded with an organized disarray of stacked planks of various lengths and kinds of wood.  Occupying most of the unshaded side of the yard is a long, plate metal box with pipes connecting it to a small charcoal-fired boiler.  Heat radiates from the contraption, and steam leaks from several seams along its sides."
