    "A delicate elven skull lies atop a shallow ledge which protrudes from the cave wall near the ceiling, sealed forever on its perch by the hardened trickle of thousands of years of mineral-rich water.  Tiny blind cave fish swim down the small stream that follows the cavern wall, flickering spots of iridescent white."
