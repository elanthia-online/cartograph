    "At the tree's apex, the walls abruptly dwindle into a circulatory of twisting tendrils that supports a huge, transparent sphere.  Outside, the dark foliage of the tree can be seen cradling the bubble in its black embrace.  Most of the interior of the observatory is filled with a vast construction.  Its surfaces appear to be mostly made of metals -- copper, iron, and bronze.  However, some gears, globes and wires are also crafted of silver and gold, giving the thing a marvelous, exotic sparkle."
