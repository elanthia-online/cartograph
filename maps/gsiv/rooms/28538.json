    "The small pavilion reeks of damp wood and mulled wine.  Tall skeletal candlebras are positioned about the room, casting flickering shadows along the rough floor which is littered with tiny misshapen fragments of bones.  Suspended from the ceiling of the tent are countless cords beaded with miniature ivory skulls and segments of finger bones, each one rattling and clacking with the slightest island breeze."
