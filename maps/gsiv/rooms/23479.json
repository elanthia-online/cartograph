    "Casks of exotic spices and kegs of liquid ingredients are piled around the room.  The rich smells of cinnamon, nutmeg and other seasonings fill the air.  Several crates of various sizes are stacked on top of each other to create an odd display.  Small powdered footprints lead in and out of the room, decorating the floor with a fanciful pattern."
