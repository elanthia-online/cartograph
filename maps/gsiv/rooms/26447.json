  "description": [
    "Sharp, dead branches from unseen trunks reach out to scratch and threaten any who venture quickly through their midst in the pitch black environs.  Avoiding their grasp could be easier away from the path, but the point of drop-off over the cliff is obscured by both blackness and a churning mantle of fog.",
    "Bent and twisted trunks of long-dead trees reach their pointed branches across the pathway.  Serrated, finger-length thorns reach out threateningly toward any who dare tread too closely, while tiny crimson drops on the narrow path mark their victories against unwary souls who have recently passed this way."
