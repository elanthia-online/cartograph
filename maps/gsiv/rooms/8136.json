    "Shadows exaggerate the rugged surfaces, conjuring up images of twisted faces and fantastical beasts.  Some of the images seem alive in the flickering darkness, as if they are struggling to escape their rocky imprisonment.  Contorted faces gape open with silent screams of hysteria.  But there is no escape."
