  "description": [
    "Rows of benches occupy most of the stately courtroom.  High above, the silver-edged sapphire banner of House Illistim hangs from the wooden rafters.  On the far wall, you see a large oaken desk occupied by the Court Justice.  Guardsmen flank either side of the desk, glaring out into the crowd as if their stares could pacify them.  Here, all come to be judged."
