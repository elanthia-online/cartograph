    "A glowing candle sits in the center of this oversized oak table, providing soft lighting.  Plush red curtains line the sides of the booth, separating it from the others and softening the noise of the surrounding room.  Carved oak chairs sit scattered around the table, with plenty of room to sit back and relax."
