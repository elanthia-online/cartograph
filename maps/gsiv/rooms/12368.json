    "The triangular sweep of shrouds, laddered with ratlines, tapers from their base beyond the aftcastle bulwark, past the lateen-rigged mizzen yard to end at the mizzen topcastle above.  Angled from the chain wales outboard along the hull to the mizzen mast above, the tilt of the shrouds, and the ratlines, make this a secure perch above the aftcastle deck.  From here you can climb up the rigging to the topcastle, or climb down the shrouds to the aftcastle deck."
