    "Polished cobblestones, lined with chipped curbs, stretch across the floor of the narrow shop, while high above colorful canvas squares are layered and stretched taut to form a protective canopy over the wares.  Boarded up windows are fitted with hooks and pegs to display some of the wares for sale here, while a small woven basket on the ground holds other items."
