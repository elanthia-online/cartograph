    "Smooth, white travertine walls painted with colorful murals are interrupted by pillars of gold-veined white marble, each of which helps to support the golden dome that caps this small room.  Tiles of red, blue, green, black, and white form concentric bands upon the ground, the center of which is a glowing ring of varicolored light.  An open archway, lined in arcane symbols, provides egress from the small structure."
