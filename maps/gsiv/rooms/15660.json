    "An antique wall hanging hangs on one of the painted black oak walls, and an ivory stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A sphere-topped black marble fountain sits in one corner of a golden blonde oak floor.  There is a lacquered wooden shelf on one side of the shop and a narrow glass-topped table on the other."
