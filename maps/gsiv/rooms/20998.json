    "Cord-like vines of green-black dangle across the richly scented, crushed long wooden table that winds its way through the surrounding jungle.  Orange, ebon, and white birds-of-paradise add a splash of color to the dark foliage, their leaf-wrapped heads turned towards the clearing in the east."
