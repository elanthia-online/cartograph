    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the celadon marble walls, and a mosaic tiled ceiling rises overhead.  A wooden statue of Rone Wehnimer sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is an etched brass bin on one side of the shop and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on the other."
