    "Dense shadows complicate travel along the path edging a rocky plateau.  Moonlight reflects upon the mist cascading down from the top of the falls, casting prismatic glimmers in a striking contrast to the oppressive darkness of the jungle at night.  Slick with condensation, the outcropping levels out to accommodate exploration, while the path provides a way to the next level of the waterfall."
