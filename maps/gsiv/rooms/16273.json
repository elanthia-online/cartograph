    "The path follows the perimeter of a low mound covered with strange, spiky ferns.  The crumbling ruins on either side of the tidy path are partially hidden by the jungle foliage.  The undergrowth has been cut back to keep the pathway clear.  On the side of the path is a crude pattern made of rough, dark red stones and small white bones."
