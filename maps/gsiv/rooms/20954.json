    "A tidal saltwater river, which runs from the central foothills of the the island to the coast, converges here with a smaller freshwater stream flowing on a pronounced course to the sea.  Lacking the strong current of its more powerful briny neighbor, the rivulet yet boasts numerous whirlpools, perhaps resulting from some hidden source or spring.  Clustered cinchona trees bow in a protective fashion over both waterways."
