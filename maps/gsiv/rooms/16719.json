  "description": [
    "Stretching away into the woods and disappearing into the dim light of the forest, is a vine-covered stone wall.  Little of the wall remains as tall and true as it once did, resembling now more a stone berm subject to the whims of the woods, with great trees and low-slung plants growing upon and over it.  Beyond the north side of the wall, a trail disappears into the trees."
