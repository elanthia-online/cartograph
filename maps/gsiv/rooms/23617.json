  "description": [
    "An underground waterfall fills the back wall of this cyclopean chamber, and a fine mist seeps across the ground as the water plunges into the depths of a seemingly bottomless pool of water below.  Planks hewn from petrified thanot stretch across the pool, forming a bridge.  Set in the center of the bridge is a podium constructed from spiderweb obsidian.  Stalagmites are scattered in an asymmetrical pattern around the floor, many smoothed down and shaped to serve as stools."
