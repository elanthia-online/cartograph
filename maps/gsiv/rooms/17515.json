    "A virtual riot of color adorns three of the walls in this cubbyhole of an office.  No rhyme or reason accompanied the brush strokes of the artist, but whatever they were attempting, it simply does not come together.  The remaining wall is covered with framed paintings and an oversized certificate on each side of the large wooden door.  A simple desk and chair set is planted in the exact middle of the room."
