    "The view of the mountain rising in the north dominates here as the jungle terrain thins to the edge of the coastal cliffs.  A breathtaking view of the ocean below is limited to the southern expanse of the beach as the prominent curve of the northwest coastline hinders further sight.  The salty scent of ocean breeze permeates the cliff, and the wind dances over the few defiant trees and patches of grass growing within the rock-laden soil."
