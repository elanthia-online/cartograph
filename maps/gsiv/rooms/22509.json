    "While this room is virtually indistinguishable from those below it, only a peaked ceiling formed by haphazardly placed beams crowns the the pine walls.  The air is nearly stifling and smells of must and sawdust.  Some uneven steps lead down to the third floor.  A rough-hewn plank has been nailed to the front of a tall wooden wardrobe."
