    "A circle of boulders surrounds a small fire, the glow of which reflects off the gem-inset canvas wall coverings, causing radiant flashes of light to flit throughout the cave.  Posed atop the stones is a pod of colorful mermaids, each holding a large anemone blossom.  Despite the flowers, the cavern still holds the stale odor of decaying fish."
