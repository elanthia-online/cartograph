  "description": [
    "Stalactites and stalagmites are scattered about this cavernous chamber within the great trunk, and small glowing veins of mithril and ruby criss-cross the walls, floor and ceiling.  Dwarven-made tools hang suspended from a wooden rack fastened above a small forge.  A trickle of water spills from a hole in one wall, cascading down to disappear into a drain in the floor.  A rainbow of sparkling light reflects off of the miniature waterfall, rewarding your eyes with a dazzling display of color."
