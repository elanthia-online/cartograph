  "description": [
    "The trees, brambles and fog all conspire to lose you within the forest, making visibility uncertain at best.  Any movement becomes a shambling stagger, more controlled tripping than a true walk as the bushes seem to reach out to purposely snare you.  Brambles obscure a crumbling section of the temple wall."
