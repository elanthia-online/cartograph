    "A wrought-iron fence encloses a small courtyard brimming with colorful blossoms in meticulously tended beds.  Smooth pillars stand at the corners of the embassy building; its facade constructed from gleaming white marble walls and accented with silvery blue stone.  The cobbled path leading directly from the entry gate to the building's steps is home to an enormous chunk of granite at its midway point."
