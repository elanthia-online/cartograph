    "Brightly colored silk in a variety of cooling hues wraps about a slender oak pole that stands centered in the area pushing up the white cotton ceiling.  A tall oak mirror stands in one corner between a curtained arch and a silk-screened partition that creates a semi private dressing nook.  Three mannequins capture the focus of the room, their forms centered on a dark carpet around the support post."
