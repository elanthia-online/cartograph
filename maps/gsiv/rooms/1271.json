    "The path slopes down into a fog-filled valley and up toward the coast, where the crashing waves can be heard even at this distance.  Rock outcroppings dot the hill, dimly visible in the night.  Lizards and spiders move rapidly across the rocks, looking for food and warmth in the shadowy pine woods.",
    "The path slopes down into a fog-filled valley and up toward the coast, where the crashing waves can be heard even at this distance.  Colorful rock outcroppings dot the hill, forming striking color combinations that please the eye.  Lizards and spiders move rapidly across the rocks, looking for food and warmth in the shadowy pine woods."
