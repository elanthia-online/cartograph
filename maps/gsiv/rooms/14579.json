  "description": [
    "This room is dank and damp, and smells of mold and chemicals.  Many vats containing dyes of different colors are crammed into the small space, with barely enough room to maneuver between them.  The ceiling is damp and sports brilliantly colored mosses.  The floor includes a network of trenches that drain any spilled dyes into a single vat in the rear of the room."
