    "The smell of leather mixed with polishing wax lingers in the air.  Lacquered metalwork hangs from a nearby rack, and several bolts of dusty fabric rest on skewed metal shelves.  A few eager folks linger in the space, picking at the walls and kicking at the muddy snow, all the while muttering to each other about a merchant that should show up any time now."
