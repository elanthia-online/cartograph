  "description": [
    "A stunning backdrop of vertical limestone faces meet with a more substantial, horizontal plane of granite that form this spacious, above-ground terrace.  Rushing water cascades down in a frothy white display of force, pooling across the black granite surface in crystal clear sheets that sparkle with reflections of golden sunlight.  In the distance, the sound of waves against the shore provides a rhythmic melody."
