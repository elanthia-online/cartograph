    "Tall cypress trees ring the rose garden, ascending like silent sentries that provide a leafy baffle of privacy.  At the base of the perimeter a good variety of rose bushes have been planted, their intoxicating fragrance thickly scenting the air.  A lush cushion of green grass carpets the garden, leaving ample space for impromptu gatherings.",

At the base of the perimeter a good variety of rose bushes have been planted, their intoxicating fragrance thickly scenting the air.  Tiny white oil lamps have been strung on ropes and woven amid the branches, producing a twinkling star-like backdrop."
