    "Darkness dominates this cavernous, empty space below deck.  Oversized hinges connect the floor to the back wall securing a massive stern door.  Sturdy, midnight blue oak planks across the expansive floor show signs of wear.  Faint scents of sulfur, sawdust, and spices linger in the open space.  A hatch leads to the deck above, while a portal leads deeper into the belly of the galleon."
