    "This expansive reserve is bordered by large snow drifts and lush with seasonal flora.  Of special note are the various rows of winterberry bushes beneath a dusting of snow, each plump red winterberry ripe for the picking.  An occasional rodent or bird sneaks in and snags a bite.  Barrels and crates have been arranged beside a set of contraptions, and in an opposite corner the foliage has been trimmed in the form of an open tome with a feather resting upon it.  A low stone pub peeks out of one of the drifts."
