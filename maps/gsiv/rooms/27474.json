    "A damaged cavern dome arcs overhead, its myriad of scarred glyphs interrupted by massive blue-black rock shards covered in helictites, thrust through the ceiling like abhorrent, metastatic stone fists.  Twin chains ending in vicious razern hooks dangle from the rock formations, set dead center.  Faint rays of sunlight peek through the shattered crown to illuminate a blackened rosewood bench inlaid with electrum damascene near the north wall, where a broken ivory statue of a man is bathed in crimson light from the large glaes orb perched upon a black altar at its feet.",
    "The overhead cavern is splintered by dark geologic formations jutting through roof like claws, rife with malignancy.  Spiraled candelabras broadcast geometric shadows across the silvery inlaid granite floor where the light is interrupted by vicious razern hooks strung from above and a blackened rosewood bench inlaid with electrum damascene set just beyond.  Dominating the north wall, a broken ivory statue is stained by the light of a crimson glaes orb set upon a black altar at the sculpture's feet.  The effigy's crooked smile is horribly marred, and a single hand remains lofted above its head."
