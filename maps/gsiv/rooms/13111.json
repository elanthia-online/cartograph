    "Moonlight casts everything in the dirt-covered yard in a silver and blue light, which is outlined in large white stones.  Wooden dummies, sparring squares, and low benches are arranged in small groups to promote friendly skirmishes and practices throughout the yard and small wooden water basins are set within easy reach of all.  Cordoned off from the rest of the practice yard are two rings, each decorated with different colored tiles.",
