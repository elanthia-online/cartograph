    "Iron lanterns illuminate the dim corridor from their positions between several windows with tightly closed shutters along the western wall.  From further down the corridor comes the cinnamon-laced aroma of morning porridge left to simmer on the hearth and the bouquet of coffee left to boil for too long.  Brighter, golden light falls across the polished oak floors from out of an open door immediately to the east.",
    "Sunlight streams through open windows, their shutters folded back to take full advantage of the daytime illumination, along the western wall of the corridor and they offer a perfect vantage point of the practice courtyard beyond.  From further down the corridor comes the gamey aroma of meats slow roasting on a spit and mingles with the nearer scent of leather oils and metal polishes that trickle out of the an open door immediately to the east."
