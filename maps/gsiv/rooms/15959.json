    "Snow mantles the meadow in drifts and gullies, dotted with the tops of boulders here and there.  The pines standing guard on the perimeter of the field are spotted with snow.  They sway faintly, while gusts occasionally launch sprays of snow-dust up in clouds which are quickly dispersed in the cold wind."
