    "An ungodly funk permeates throughout this chamber, and the reason for the stench rests along the southern wall.  Slumped in the corner rests the decaying corpse of a fallen warrior.  In his hands, he still clutches his instruments of warfare.  Pity, for they obviously did very little to fend off whatever may have killed him."
