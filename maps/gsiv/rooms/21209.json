    "Burning fitfully from its anchor in the wall, the reed and straw torch that illuminates the passage fills the air with the acrid scent of burning whale fat.  Uneven cobblestones jut up from the ground at odd angles, which is a complete contrast to the smoothness of the nearby walls and ceiling."
