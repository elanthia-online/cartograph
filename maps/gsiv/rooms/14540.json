    "A grove of spiny black palm trees has sprouted, the rapidly growing trees dying and reseeding themselves until they have grown into a maze of thorns.  The live trees grow together densely, supporting the fallen trunks of their dead brethren at bizarre angles.  Tiny nests among the thorns and the occasional flash of showy scarlet and plum plumage show that a charm of hummingbirds has taken advantage of the natural defense."
