    "A dense stand of modwir trees crowds the shore line.  Beneath their large branches, a path wends along, following the curves of the water like an admiring suitor.  A thin fog floats gently in the air, curling sensuously around the modwir trunks, and slipping out across the quiet water.  The gentle slapping of the waves against the rocks is absorbed almost completely, lending an eerie ambiance to the beach."
