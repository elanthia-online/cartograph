  "description": [
    "This corridor is quiet, and the decorations here are minimal.  A soft carpet woven with several hues of complementary autumnal shades matches the polished cherrywood of the walls.  A golden haon door stands between a pair of triple-pronged candelabrum affixed to the walls, and opposite is a scorched monir door and an oak door inlaid with jade vines."
