    "The interwoven canopy of snowy boughs creates a tunnel effect on a narrow, secluded path that winds northeast towards a gate within a grey stone wall.  Fallen pine needles from the coniferous forest pad the trail with a fragrant carpet that both muffles footfalls and adds traction to the snow-covered ground.  The sound of wild songbirds in the trees occasionally trills through the area, and the scent of wood smoke beckons from further down the path."
