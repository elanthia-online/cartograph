  "description": [
    "Barnacles have colonized the lower edges of the pilings that support the pier, and the flashes of small silver fish are visible in the moonlight.  Pieces of broken shells litter the tops of the large timbers, apparently from gulls taking up a perch there to feast on a meal of shellfish.  The docks are completely bare, and the cluster of warehouses in the middle of the pier cast strange shadows across the planks."
