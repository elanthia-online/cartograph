  "description": [
    "A wooden platform contains blocks of marble cut in various shapes and sizes.  A block and tackle system used for moving the heavy stone remains set into the ceiling, though there is no sign of any rope.  Some rail ties have been twisted around a tall pillar of black granite, which appears to have been damaged by the mining cart that lies smashed nearby.  Two rows of holes drilled into the granite floor lead away from the pillar into the low, dark tunnel to the east."
