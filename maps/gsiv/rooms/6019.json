    "Heavy granite slabs have been carefully butted together to form a wide, flat area in the northeast corner of the barn.  Chaff and grain are scattered across the floor, but for the most part it is clean.  A wide door on the north wall and a wide door on the east wall are both securely locked.",
    "Heavy granite slabs have been carefully butted together to form a wide, flat area in the northeast corner of the barn.  Chaff and grain are scattered across the floor, but for the most part it is clean.  A wide door on the north wall and a wide door on the east wall are both securely locked.  It is easy to picture them both open, though, and the wind coursing through this corner of the barn, carrying the chaff outside as the heavier wheat falls to the granite floor in the threshing process."
