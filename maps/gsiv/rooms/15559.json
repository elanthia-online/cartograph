    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the textured blue silk walls, and an elegantly arched fel ceiling rises overhead.  A serene golden wyvern fountain sits in one corner of a glossy black ebonwood floor.  There is a gold-veined black marble counter on one side of the shop and a polished maoral table on the other."
