    "Diminutive bergamot trees spring from the soft ground, graduating to the shady, abundant forms of aromatic faewood trees.  A hazy mist lingers around the silvery tree trunks, obscuring what lies beyond their lush foliage.  The verdant grove canopies the greenwood below with fully outstretched branches."
