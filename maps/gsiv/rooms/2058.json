  "description": [
    "An ancient cobblestone road runs down a raised embankment toward the south end of the island.  The stones were once perfectly set so that a wagon must have passed over as if on a single sheet of stone.  But time unmakes all mortal labor, and no backs have toiled here for many seasons."
