    "A dense ground cover of saw palmetto makes for difficult navigation of the faint pathway leading east to west.  Sharp spines protrude from elongated petioles that support the silvery green, fan-shaped leaves.  A brave soul has attempted to make the site more welcoming by staking brightly colored posts, each topped with a grinning gargoyle finial, among the shrubs."
