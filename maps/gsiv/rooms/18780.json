    "The broad sweep of the ceramic tile floor is interrupted by a grey-veined white marble fountain.  Halfway to the polished haon ceiling, a decorative linden branch wreath hangs on one of the patterned white walls.  A large oak table and a gold-trimmed ebonwood chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
