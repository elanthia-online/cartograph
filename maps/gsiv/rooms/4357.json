    "Set back away from the stove, the air here is cool, but no less aromatic.  A low wooden counter topped with a narrow linen runner holds a display of dried foods, and a nearby table offers a selection of breads and miscellaneous items.  A small wax paper pouch hangs from a single iron hook above the table."
