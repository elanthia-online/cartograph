    "Creeping ivy spreads across the dappled granite that makes up the temple walls enclosing this peaceful little garden, where small patches of lilies of the valley add a faint touch of brightness to the silent grey-green surroundings.  An ancient yew tree, its huge trunk gnarled and bent over a curved stone bench, stretches its limbs across the enclosed courtyard.  Its tapered leaves shift and seem to rustle in the errant currents of wind, but there is no sound, nor any sound of birds or buzzing insects.",
