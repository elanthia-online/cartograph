    "Tall reeds and bullrushes line the rolling, spongy pathway.  Bone grey fog floats over the path, enveloping the area in an abnormal, foul-smelling chill air.  The rushes sway sinuously, although there is no breeze to move the fog.  The noise of night insects, muted by the thick fog, comes from all directions."
