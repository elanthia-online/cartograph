    "The grass along the path is tall and full, occasionally trodden at the edges of the path.  Wildflowers grow in several places amidst the grass and you even see several small holes, likely the burrows of some small animal or other.  A plume of bluish grey smoke is visible rising from the chimney of a small log cabin to the east."
