  "description": [
    "Little more than pieces of wood nailed together, a small rectangular shack burps smoke that drifts up through a hole in its roof.  Loganberry trails up the sides of the hovel and partially obscures the doorway.  Swinging back and forth on its freshly oiled hinges, the gate of the split rail fence is bedecked with a garishly painted woodcarving of a muscle-bound male hefting a huge hammer over his head."
