    "Large pieces of rusted iron cover the floor.  In the center, several large pieces rest precariously atop each other, tied together with lengths of rough rat-hair rope.  Some look like sections of pipe and a corroded valve rests at the bottom.  Small tallow torches sputter from the walls, sending shadowy mockeries of the already ridiculous iron statue cavorting about the room."
