    "Two large, partially closed windows let in starlight and the sweet scent of vanilla, emanating from the delicate vines of the vanilla-bearing orchid wrapping about the outer frames.  An oval-shaped pale rose carpet lies beneath a silver beechwood desk, a hint of blue-washed sandstone floors showing about the edges.  Matching bookshelves line one wall, filled with neatly organized scrolls, books, and parchments.  An unusual, potted plant occupies one corner by itself, nothing kept within its reach.",
