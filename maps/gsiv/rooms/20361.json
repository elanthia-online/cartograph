  "description": [
    "At the crown, the topmost boughs of the banyan brush the sides of the platform, cradling it in a dense tangle of wildly growing branches.  Burning torches are affixed to the rope railing that marks off the edge of the drop, beyond which is the ground, far below.  A spiraling staircase in the center of the landing leads back down into the heart of the tree."
