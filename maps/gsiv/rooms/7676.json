  "description": [
    "The interior of this mausoleum is dim, the air dry and stale.  It appears to have been carved and hollowed out of a solid stone outcropping, its construction keeping the contents free of rot and decay.  Primitive friezes in low bas relief cover the walls, telling of raging tides, storms and warriors lost at sea."
