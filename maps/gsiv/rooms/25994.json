    "Steam rising from a dark cauldron is touched by prisms of color cast from the crystalline walls of the room.  A floating orb hangs above a long wooden table set with chairs upholstered in finely-tooled leather.  Bookcases lined with tomes of magic are placed against one wall while a low workbench graces another."
