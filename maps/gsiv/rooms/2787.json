  "description": [
    "Pinefar's Depository is painted a respectable shade of dark green.  A couple of dusty-looking animal trophies decorate the walls.  The entire back of the room is covered with a wooden screen polished to the same luster as elsewhere in the manor, and behind this carved grill sits a sleepy-looking halfling, painstakingly counting a pile of coins."
