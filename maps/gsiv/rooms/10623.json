    "As the trail reaches the base of an incline, thorny greenbrier fills the close spaces between the trees with a thick tangle of underbrush.  A pleasant breeze carries with it a thick, loamy smell and sends dark brown oak leaves swirling over the hard-packed earth of the trail.  The avenue of trees gradually disappears into the densely wooded forest."
