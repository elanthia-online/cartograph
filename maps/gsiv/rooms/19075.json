    "The small platform of oak surrounds the towering mainmast.  A waist-high maoral railing circles the crow's nest, providing a handhold in rough seas.  The view is spectacular, a panorama of multi-colored rooftops, with curls of smoke dancing up from the residences and shops.  The ship below looks like a miniature, and the people milling about its decks, like wind-up toys."
