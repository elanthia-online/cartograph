    "Walls covered in black watered silk blend seamlessly with a curving black willow bar.  The light in this room is low and the atmosphere is intimate, with warmth emanating from the flames in a gold-flecked onyx fireplace.  Scattered on the rug in front of the fireplace are a few red velvet-covered cushions, and a large grey sable couch is placed against the opposite wall.  Hanging a safe distance from any seating area is a multicolored dart board."
