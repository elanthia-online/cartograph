  "description": [
    "The cavern is deep and wide, shrouded in darkness and illuminated only by strands of spectral pale light.  Rising out among the stalagmites, is a huge wooden palisade wall, broken up by a pair of giant towers, comprised of bones and ligaments.  Between the ghastly towers is a barbed black iron gate."
