  "description": [
    "Sharp gusts whip salty spray over massive squares of arm-width granite, their surfaces roughly carved with palm-sized spirals, creating a stable walkway that snakes out into the obsidian ocean shrouded by viscous mist.  Sharp volcanic glass spires rise up to pierce the surface of the churning waters, as waves lap at the sheer drop-offs and black sandy beaches on either side of the walkway.  Flotsam gathers along the coasts that extend perpendicular to the jetty, into the grey mists that clutch at the island."
