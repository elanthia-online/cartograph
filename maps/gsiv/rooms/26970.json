    "Stretching from the Needle's entry to the eastern wall, a long series of arched trellis interconnect to create a tunnel through the gardens.  Vigorously rambling roses weave through the open lattice of the wooden structure, the lavender rosebuds and ivory blossoms adorned with verdant leaves.  Small glass lanterns illuminate the gold-veined marble pathway, while a smooth stone bench provides a place to rest."
