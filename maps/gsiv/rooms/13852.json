    "The floor in this part of the workshop is clear, leaving a large open area.  Deep ruts are worn in the stone, implying years of use as well as some respectable weight resting there.  The southern wall is empty of the heavy carving on almost every available surface elsewhere in the tunnels of Cavernfast.  A pair of chains flank the wall, hanging down on either side of the bare area. Their diameters are easily as thick as a dwarf's belly."
