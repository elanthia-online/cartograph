    "A line of hard wooden chairs is set against one wall of this spacious tent, directly across from an embroidered tapestry.  One corner is occupied by a tall fireleaf cabinet, its battered fiery-hued doors open wide to display several items of hanging clothing.  The wind periodically causes the canvas walls of the tent to ripple, sending the coppery scent of blood flowing through the space.",
