    "A foggy, malodorous mire, dotted with the grey stumps of dead trees, impedes any passage to the north.  The far end of the mire is lost in the fog.  A soft breeze carries the stink of rot and decay from the mire.  The pathway is boggy underfoot.  Only the faintest hint of moonlight filters through the thick fog."
