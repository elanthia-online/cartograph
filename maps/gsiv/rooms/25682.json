    "The Treble Clef table is octagonal in shape and sits nestled into a quiet corner of the Conch Pub.  Chairs sit around it, their backs carved with a pattern of interlocking bass and treble clef musical notations.  A similar pattern is carved on the tabletop, circling the perimeter of the eight sides."
