    "Beneath a black-veined white marble dome painted with a mural of a star-blanketed night, a pair of crossed rolaren claidhmores with deathstone pommels hangs on one of the mica-flecked black marble walls.  An elaborately carved leaf-shaped black marble table and a detailed ruby-trimmed mithril vault sit in opposite corners while a carved marble ranger colossus wielding a deathstone-pommeled mithril claidhmore rests on a black and white checkered marble tile floor."
