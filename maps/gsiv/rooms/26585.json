    "At this end of the beach, a tall headland comprised of basalt, shale, and limestone rises up from the ocean, a thin strip of black sand disappearing around the far edge to the other side.  Sand ripples are more pronounced here, giving a wavy texture to the fine black granules, resulting from the more violent waves crashing against the rocks.  Near the last of the torches a sign warns of the danger near the cliff.",
