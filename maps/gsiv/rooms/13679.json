    "The broad sweep of the wooden floor is interrupted by a pile of unmarked crates.  Halfway to the wooden ceiling, an ancient battered tower shield hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  A large cherrywood cabinet and a iron-bound ebonwood chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
