  "description": [
    "The gentle plinking sound of water droplets falling upon a haphazard pile of stones is softened by moss-covered walls meant to reduce ambient noise.  Jutting out from the ground are several feldspar benches that create a ring around a modwir tree serving as the room's central focal point.  A heavy curtain of lapis and chalcedony-beaded strands frames a poorly sculpted archway leading back towards the main shopping area."
