    "Built into the rock face, the derelict tavern is relatively bare, with only a handful of slipshod tables and chairs tucked under funnel-shaped glass lamps hanging from the craggy ceiling.  Cluttered on one side with six tall stools, a rough-edged oak bar is covered in a milky film, and the other side is entirely bereft of clean glassware and -- perhaps the reason for the general lack of patrons -- liquor.  Middling circular holes that serve as windows are cut into the rock and offer a view of the seascape to the east."
