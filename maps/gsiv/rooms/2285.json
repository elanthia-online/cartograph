    "Greenish tinted bones are strewn all over this large room, a stark contrast to the huge blocks of black marble lying in ruins at your feet.  The scent of death is strong here, as scant bits of flesh that still cling to these skeletons moulder with age.  At first you wonder about the strange color of the remains you see, but the sight of the thorny vines wrapped around the bodies holds a clue you'd rather not consider."
