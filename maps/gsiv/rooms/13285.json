    "Dazzling in its stark simplicity, the room's white is relieved only by the bottles of dye and matching fabric swatches displayed on its white marble counters.  A massive glowing orb reveals every shade to its utmost depth of color as it hangs suspended from a fragile knotted silk net attached to the ceiling."
