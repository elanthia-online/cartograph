    "Again, one is moved to marvel at the superb workmanship epitomized by this statue.  A lattice of delicate veins trace a pattern across the eyelid, making it seem that the eye could open at any moment.  Each masterfully rendered eyelash framing it is sheathed in ice, like frozen tears collected along the eye's fringe."
