  "description": [
    "The walls are paneled in oak for about a height of three feet.  Above that a mural is painted on all four walls simulating looking out over an ocean from a great height.  To the east a few islands are visible in the distance.  On the west wall several dolphins cavort.  The only breaks in the mural are the door and a wide window.  The white gauzy curtains on the window seem to blend into clouds on the mural.  A large bed with a sky blue bedspread sits in one corner."
