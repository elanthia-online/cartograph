    "Broken bottles, discarded rubbish, and uneasy feelings pervade this dank, ill-lit dead end.  Several unsavory-looking citizens seem to be lurking here and there in the shadows for want of anything better to do, and the scratching of rats can be heard from within the nearby walls.  A pile of old crates is stacked against the back wall of the alley."
