    "Verdant green tiles are fitted with moss-green stones in an alternating pattern that grows darker and more solid as it ascends to the chamber's ceiling.  Blown glass orbs, five in total, encircle a simple, spiral staircase, while a viridian and agate bench pays homage to a round southeast-facing window."
