    "Waves crash against the moonlit white sands of a large lagoon in the north.  Dense jungle vegetation covers the hillside behind it, a blanket of near perfect darkness.  A well-lit dock lies to the east, dwarfed by the sheer cliff wall behind it.  The white sails of small boats can be seen as they travel the nearby waters."
