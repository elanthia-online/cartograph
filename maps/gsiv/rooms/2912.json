    "A cascade of ice hangs from the jagged lip of the cliff overhead, its once rushing waters having frozen into a large icicle that has fused with the slippery layer of ice covering the ledge.  Long ago the cascade must have been a beautiful spectacle of harmless serenity, but no more.  Now it is a treacherous obstacle that must be navigated with caution."
