    "Dust and cobwebs are everywhere in here, sitting undisturbed atop piles of crates and cartons.  Off to one side, a small polished maoral counter neatly displays a variety of items for sale.  Behind the counter is a stack of sealed coffers, each marked with a strange series of characters.  An aged but well maintained rug near the exit adds a bit of color to this otherwise drab room."
