    "Various glass-front cabinets ring the small room, their shelves laden with an amalgamation of drinking vessels in a wide range of sizes, colors, shapes, and materials.  Opposite the displays is a beautiful fresco, its detailed decorations occupying the entire wall, that depicts the arkati Cholen reclining against a fountain.  Brilliantly glowing orbs dangle from the ceiling, their unwavering light dispelling any shadows from the surrounding area."
