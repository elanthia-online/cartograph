  "description": [
    "Diffuse light fills the dining room of this eatery, with the amber glow of the overhead lanterns struggling to pierce the humid smog that lurks in the air.  At least the haze is fragrant, warm with savory scents that in part originate with the copper pot fitfully bubbling amid the disarray of scattered tables.  Only the occasional shout from the kitchen disturbs the laid back ambience, leaving the scuffing of chairs and the murmur of customers and staff as neutral white noise in the background."
