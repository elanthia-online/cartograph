    "This small chamber has been lined with rough-hewn stones.  A deep pile of thick pile of thick furs lies before a small fireplace.  A small rack of firewood fills the room with the pungent smell of freshly split wood.  Hung above the fireplace is a gleaming steel-bound shield, backed by a crossed axe and hammer."
