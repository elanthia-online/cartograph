    "Soft chimes emanate from a delicate crystal chandelier that hangs overhead.  As the chandelier rotates slowly on its axis, the crystal prisms refract the light from the candles' flames and lengthen the shadows over the walls and floor.  Twin filing cabinets, roughly the height of a halfling, occupy opposite corners of the office.  Swaying gently above and behind the intricately carved desk hangs a royal-blue silken banner with the words, \"Welcome One And All,\" embroidered in gold thread."
