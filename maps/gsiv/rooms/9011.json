    "Between twin rows of buildings sits an open courtyard blotted with an occasional fragrant midden.  Fresh air keeps the smell from permeating this narrow space.  Oil lamps outline a patch of lush grass neatly maintained with a trim of blue-grey riverstones.  Several well-placed benches create a small common area for socializing, or just for stargazing in a somewhat private setting.",
    "Between twin rows of buildings sits an open courtyard blotted with an occasional fragrant midden.  Fresh air keeps the smell from permeating this narrow space.  Attempts have been made to make the area more appealing, as a patch of lush grass is neatly maintained with a trim of blue-grey riverstones.  Colorful flowers dot each corner of the park-like oblong, between which rest benches.  Laundry draped upon the ropes stretched between the buildings is barely noticeable, except when they flap loudly."
