    "Two intricately carved overlarge arched windows provide the room with an open, airy feeling.  Long lengths of pale natural silks drape the arches in a loose frame that stirs with the slightest breeze.  Faint claw marks mar the sill as if large cats have exited through the windows.  In one corner, a large divan faces opposite a river stone fireplace, which is flanked by a pair of tall, freestanding wrought iron candelabra.  Tucked discreetly in the corner is a basket of sticks."
