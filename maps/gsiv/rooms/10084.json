    "An enormous tree has fallen across the road, taking several smaller trees with it on its plunge.  The cobblestoned road is cracked and the stones upturned in a jumbled heap alongside the massive trunk.  The area has become a sort of construction zone, as groups of elves work to clear the rubble and remove the tree."
