  "description": [
    "No stone walls mark the edges of the ancient road here, only a narrow strip of black dirt that is clearer of plants and jagged rocks than the desolate landscape that surrounds it.  A massive stone gate marks the southern edge of the moor, standing sentinel over the slope that leads beyond it into the lowlands."
