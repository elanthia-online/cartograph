    "Levelling out from the dramatic slope to the east, the valley is an endless sea of wild greenery, stretching west as far as the eye can see.  Several large banyan trunks lay at right angles to one another, felled by storm or time.  No other landmarks exist to pinpoint where in the wilds this spot might exactly be."
