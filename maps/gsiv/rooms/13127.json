  "description": [
    "Illuminated by dozens of copper-wrapped glass lanterns, the room is a constant bustle of traffic that flows in and out of the office.  A worn track in the polished oak floors forms a triangle around the room from the carved mahogany desk, a series of waxy parchment maps covering the western wall, and the open sturdy oak door.  Several wooden chairs are made available for the scouts and runners that briefly visit."
