  "description": [
    "The battering of the sea against the shore is only slightly subdued beneath this middle pier, with the brunt of wave action being born by the outermost piers to either side.  Shredded ribbons of dark green kelp drape themselves as though sunbathing across the flat-topped rocks and boulders where the land meets the sea.  A few cracked shells lay empty upon the shore, while tiny tracks of crustaceans lead to and from the water's edge."
