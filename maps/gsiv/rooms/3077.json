    "Originally an ice quarry, the snowfields have been converted by the adventurous and the well-heeled into a habitable neighborhood.  Steep banks prevent the worst of the weather from reaching the homes, while heavily pitched roofs force snow to slide off to the sides of the buildings.  The roadway and paths snaking around the area appear to have been recently cleared from the constant snowfall."
