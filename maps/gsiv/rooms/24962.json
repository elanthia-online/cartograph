    "Some open curtains of heavy, dark green velvet drape the vast stage, and argent tenting protects it and the closest  from the elements without ruining the view of the rest of the audience.  Globes of ethereal, magical lights hang overhead, beaming their glows in strategic directions controlled by a series of overhead ropes and pulleys that disappear behind the dark, backstage curtains.  A shiny silver plaque adorns the front of a podium to the right of the stage and a walkway leads up and out."
