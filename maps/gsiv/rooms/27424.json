    "Flickering candles cast long shadows in this small room.  Jars containing various body parts sit on shelves around the room and rotted skulls hang from the ceiling with leather ties.  The pungent aroma of incense, laden with ginger, cinnamon, and peppercorns, lingers in the room.  Centered on the back wall is an altar adorned with a shimmering green table runner and three skulls situated around burning incense.  Clustered around a small round table are a wrought iron cage, a black wicker basket, and an oak chest."
