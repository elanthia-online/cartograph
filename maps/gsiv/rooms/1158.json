  "description": [
    "The dusty trail along the bank of the river is trampled considerably, the constant footsteps stifling any grass or brush attempting to grow.  To the west, the impenetrable forest blocks any travel away from the river.  To the north, a thick copse of trees and underbrush clings to the bank of the river.  The only directions of travel are southward along the riverbank or northwestward into a mushy swamp."
