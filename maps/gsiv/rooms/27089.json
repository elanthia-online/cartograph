    "A school of tiny silver fish dart back and forth near the shoreline, shifting away when the water laps too roughly at the edge of the lagoon, then moving quickly back to nibble at algae when the current is lulled once more.  Several fragrant flowers dot the moss-covered soil that makes up the expanse of shoreline, while the rich verdant hues of the trees and shrubs of the jungle serve as an exotic backdrop to a decorated bamboo hut."
