    "To the west the trail begins a downward slope, and to the east it follows a long bluff overlooking the river.  The bluff has fallen away in a few places, adding rubble to the larger rocks already present in the river's course.  The trail winds around these fallen places, squeezing narrowly between the forest and the crumbly edge of the bluff, only to widen out again with the expansion of the bluff's surface."
