    "Shielded by verdant hedges, the spire's reflection garden adds a grace note of natural beauty to the building's austere architecture.  A circular pool surrounded by smooth white benches provides a serene focal point for the setting, while artfully shaped topiaries create a private reserve of fanciful beasts along the tranquil garden's periphery.  Flowering vines around a central statue add a note of welcome color."
