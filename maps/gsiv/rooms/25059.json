    "Lacquered wooden and metal wagons fill the area, their once bright facades now faded from exposure to the harsh elements.  Several vehicles have been ransacked, their belongings tossed out across the narrow stairways, leaving splinters and shreds splayed along the perimeter.  A few wagons remain intact, however, each one dangling an oddly formed talisman above their doorway."
