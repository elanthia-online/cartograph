    "Twin staircases lead up to a large golden pavilion set high upon a dais.  The brilliant silk of the structure glimmers in the bright sunlight, its sides rolled up to give a view from all directions.  Ceramic urns of crimson blossoms and pure white roses fill the gathering space with their bright colors and heavy fragrance.  Sapphire blue and crimson pennants fly high above the building, capping the peaks of the roof.",
