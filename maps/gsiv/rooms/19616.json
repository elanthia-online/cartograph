    "The back of the wagon is quite cramped with various ironwood barrels that line the red oak walls, as well as a lacquered rosewood mirror.  A purple velvet tapestry stands between a small bed and an old card table along the western wall, with a dart board that hangs over a red oak display cabinet."
