  "description": [
    "Framed by massive, variegated leaves of deep emerald hue, the elongated stalks of draping ivory lilies extend proudly forth in scattered groups around the trunks of jungle trees.  The steady drone of crickets and other nocturnal insects echoes within the jungle, seemingly from all sides at once.  A flash of muted color can occasionally be seen from beneath the large blooms of the lilies, as moonlight reflects from the backs of frogs that call it their home."
