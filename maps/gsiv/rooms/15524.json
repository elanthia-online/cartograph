    "The scent of sulphur lies heavy in the air, and a blazing torch brightly illuminates everything.  A thick mithril door stands opposite a battered bronze one, with the latter appearing as though it had recently been beat down.  A number of stone chips litter the back wall, whereupon a sconce is set."
