  "description": [
    "High-pitched chittering and squeaking resound from somewhere in the darkness far above.  Often the sounds are punctuated by the flapping of wings as something flies away into the cavern, the flapping growing fainter and fainter before disappearing.  The bones here are covered with bat guano, both dried and moist, though the dried portions seem to quickly turn to powder that filters down through the spaces between the tightly packed bones."
