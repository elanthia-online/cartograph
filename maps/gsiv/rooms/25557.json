  "description": [
    "A treacherous and impassible cliff, no more than two feet from the mouth of the cave, disappears into a wintery mix of fog and snow.  Eerie howls echo through the mountainous crevices and are unidentifiable whether from wind or some unfriendly foe.  Occasional breaks in the thick veil overhead allow warming rays of light to bleed through, but they are quickly snuffed by the heavy clouds and blinding sheets of falling snow."
