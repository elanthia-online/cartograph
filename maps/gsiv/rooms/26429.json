    "Only the narrowest of pathways remains passable, and identifying safe egress in the inky blackness of night is treacherous at best.  The entire southwest corner of the mountain base has eroded here, forming a talus slope of loose, coarse debris leading down toward the water below.  A sharp angle of repose gives the accumulated scree a precarious hold on the steep incline; a single footstep could send an avalanche of detritus clattering into the dark sea below.",
