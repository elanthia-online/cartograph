    "There are more living trees than dead ones here, as the forest begins to reclaim the village.  A wooden border fence lies fallen over on the ground, no longer serving as protection from the encroaching wildlife.  The songs of a few birds can be heard coming from high in the branches of the living trees.  The contrast of life overtaking death is prominent."
