    "Brightly colored river pebbles have been crafted into a mosaic in the floor.  Inset in the orange-hued stucco walls are a series of green ceramic tiles, each decorated with a highly stylized image of the scales of justice. A sturdy stout iron gate is set in the south wall.  A circle of windows around the dome of the rotunda allows moonlight to flood the room.",
