  "description": [
    "An ivy-covered wall with a wrought iron gate encloses the garden.  Colorful flower beds border the wide expanse of close-cropped grass which surrounds a small lily pond spanned by a fanciful wrought iron footbridge.  Fireflies glimmer around a graceful wooden arbor covered with silver and white tea roses beside the water.  Several trees are scattered across the lawn, a particularly large one rising near the bridge.  Silvery lions mounted on the stone wall hold glowing, cut-crystal oil lamps."
