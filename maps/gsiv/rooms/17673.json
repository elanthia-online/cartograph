    "What appears to be the derelict remains of a sailing vessel rests half-consumed by sand and brambles on the south side of the street.  On the north side, numerous wood-built buildings of varying design and elevation swing northward to join with the busy Broad Way.  Hand-pulled wagons, laden with canvas-covered boxes, sit in the center of the street, while merchants argue and barter adjacent.  Under the shade of the ruined vessel, children crowd around a circle filled with marbles.",

On the north side, numerous wood-built buildings of varying design and elevation swing northward to join with the busy Broad Way.  Several hand-pulled wagons, laden with canvas-covered boxes, sit to one side of the street.  Occasionally, large rats run back and forth from the brambles to the other side of the street heading north."
