  "description": [
    "Suspsended from the ceiling, a wrought iron chandelier dimly lights the archway with its soft, evocative light.  Clerical robes and vestments hang from brass hooks lining the walls on both sides.  Several pairs of leather sandals rest on a low wooden rack on the floor.  A small prayer book has been left, perhaps forgotten, on the rack with the humble sandals."
