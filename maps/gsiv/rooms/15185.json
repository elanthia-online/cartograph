  "description": [
    "The broad sweep of the black marble floor is interrupted by some large invar-bound ale kegs.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a detailed DragonSpine landscape hangs on one of the varnished ebonwood walls.  A glass-topped mistwood counter and a plank-covered barrel table are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
