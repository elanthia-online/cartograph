    "Illuminated by a single torch set into a far corner, the dimly lit room is riddled with discarded flagons and steins that clutter the area and make silent movement complicated.  Most of the containers seem to lay in circles around a large copper-spigoted barrel, though a few also decorate an oversized dark wooden desk."
