    "Tall trees line both sides of a wide and rocky path, a mixture of grey-barked haon mingling with shingle monirs, quaking aspens, and silvery beeches to create a thick canopy overhead.  Slivers of moonlight strike the forest floor in thin beams, lending to the stillness of the setting, broken by the occasional hoot of an owl.",
    "Tall trees line both sides of a wide and rocky path, a mixture of grey-barked haon mingling with shingle monirs, quaking aspens, and silvery beeches to create a thick canopy overhead.  Dappled sunlight streams down to the forest floor in thin beams, encouraging the growth of wild flowers, like delicate white may apples and lavender lady slippers."
