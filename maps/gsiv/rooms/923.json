    "A thin shelf, no wider than the length of a hand, juts outward from one of the walls of the passage.  Atop its narrow surface squats the frozen remains of a candle, its remaining wax pooled into a blob-like mound.  The thunderous roar of the unseen river is deafening here, its passage causing the stone floor and lower parts of the walls to quiver."
