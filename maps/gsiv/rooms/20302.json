    "Soft indigo walls, bare of any ornamentation, encase the area in pale color.  Gracing each wall, cut-outs in the tent allow sunlight to stream in, and conflagrant candles scattered throughout the area provide even more light.  Just next to a trio of large easels and an assortment of vividly colored pillows, an elaborately carved table bears neatly laid out painting supplies, including a palette stained with oils."
