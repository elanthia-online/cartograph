  "description": [
    "Stacked casks of mead and ale take up most of the space in this huge room dedicated to storage.  From the amount of stored food, one can surmise that either a war is coming or the members of the Hall have huge appetites.  A half-windowed door to the south gives a picturesque view of the livestock pens of the Inner Bailey."
