    "Mounted along each wall are gears, cogs, and dials of various shapes and sizes.  A row of ornate wooden houses dominates the upper half of the far wall forming zigzag-lines of large and small rooftops and dangling chained weights.  The center of the room is overtaken by a large cog turned on its side; the spaces between the teeth are easily large enough to accommodate even the stoutest dwarf.  Within the center of the cog is a large glass-covered dome.  A perfectly round wooden door leads to the next room."
