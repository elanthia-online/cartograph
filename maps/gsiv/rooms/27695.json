    "The lower half of the walls is paneled in dark ebonwood, while the upper half is painted a matte slate grey.  Candelabra attached to the walls cast flickering firelight on the room, and a mirror hangs between two of them.  Several sculptures in dark hues grace the pale grey marble floor and a tall ebonwood and metal device, along with a sign resting on a black marble pedestal, join them.  Several black-garbed attendants stand at attention, their hands clasped behind their backs."
