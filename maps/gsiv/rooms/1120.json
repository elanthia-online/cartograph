    "This rocky shelf is narrow, dusty and dry.  It does have one amenity, though.  To the northwest the broad panorama of the upper Locksmehr River valley spreads out along the horizon.  The Locksmehr River, a glistening ribbon of water, snakes down through the darker patches of the Khohallatain Forest.  Closer to you the forest reveals small glimpses of a creek cascading away to eventually join the larger river.",
