    "The colonnaded aisle traverses the central nave.  Rectangular windows set high in the tall exterior walls throw oval pools of light down onto the frozen flagstones.  On either side, rows of columns stretch away into the shadowy interior like silent guardians made of ice.  To the west, glimpses of the huge frozen formation alternate with the double row of columns."
