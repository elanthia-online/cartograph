    "A breathtaking artificial sky covers the domed ceiling of the hemispherical cavern, its wispy white clouds painted onto the cerulean-hued enamel with consummate skill.  The rough-hewn walls are a dramatic contrast to the delicacy of the celestial mural, a solid reminder that the chamber is deeply rooted in stone.  Arcs of granite benches surround a central platform with an ironwood lectern set atop it."
