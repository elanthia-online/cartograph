    "Brass-framed wall sconces set with white tallow candles line the long expanse of this hallway, providing it with soothing illumination.  A cotton runner, dyed in the traditional blue and silver of Solhaven Bay, covers the polished oak floor that leads to a set of steps to the north and the foyer to the south."
