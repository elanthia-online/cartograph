  "description": [
    "None of the elegant splendor present in the rest of the abbey exists in this dank cellar.  Greenish-grey lichen flourishes on the damp fieldstone walls, barely visible in the light provided by a single sputtering oil lamp set in the south wall between a mithril barred door and a cracked modwir door.  A set of granite stairs curves upwards along the western wall, warm candlelight filtering down from above."
