    "The area is composed of a stone platform, extending out from the main tower.  In the center of the floor rests a slightly damaged workbench.  The floor surrounding the workbench is scorched with black marks which radiate out from the center to the edges of the platform.  The skeleton of a small winged creature lies partially destroyed and scattered to one side of the area.  The shine of the moons floods the area with a strong white light."
