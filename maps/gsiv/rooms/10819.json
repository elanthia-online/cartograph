    "The road takes a brief northern jog, rising slightly as it does so.  The reeds, cattails and bulrushes still press in against the road, but the ground seems parched and dry, as if there hasn't been a rain in a good while.  The surrounding vegetation is stiff and colorless, easily breaking off at the touch of a hand.  The sheer thickness of it, though, prevents any digression from the road.  An errant spark would quickly turn this area into a raging inferno.",
