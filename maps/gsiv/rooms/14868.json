    "The grotto is quiet, protected by the fieldstone walls that surround it and create an overhang above, stretching around to protect the eastern entrance with their lichen-covered arms.  Water flows down the back of the grotto, tripping over the stones and falling into a dark pool beneath.  The pool's surface ripples softly, hiding the secrets of its depths with a constant undulation.  A statue stands at the side of the pool, its visage stoic and its secrets lost in time."
