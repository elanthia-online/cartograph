    "A faint trail circles the edge of a particularly large pool, its surface as quiescent as a sheet of glass.  The edges of the pool encircle it with unnaturally even delineation, sweeping around the water as though cradling it.  Mist drifts across the landscape, moving in slow eddies like ships on a striated ocean."
