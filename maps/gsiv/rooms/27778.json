    "Plush, icy blue cushions are grouped together in giant piles through the room, providing a soft place of respite against the polished haon floor.  A tall ladderback rocking chair sits behind a long, cluttered desk at the back of the room, the chair moving of its own accord every so often.  A flimsy set of stairs leads back down to the main shopping area."
