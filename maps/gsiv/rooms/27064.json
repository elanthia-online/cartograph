    "Tangled together, creeping thyme and star-blossomed cypress vines drape across the crumpled structures of aged kiosks and tattered pavilions as they climb upon the moss and clover-covered ground in sweeping arcs towards a leafy vine-covered arch.  Thick-bodied magnolia saplings, laden with bright pink-edged blossoms, crowd the spaces between old, dilapidated structures.  Shining in the moonlight, an old string of bells lies half-buried in the verdant growth."
