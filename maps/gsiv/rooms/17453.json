    "A low mist covers the ground, drifting across the soil like searching fingers.  Several paces from the hard-packed dirt road, standing approximately eight feet high, an obelisk with numerous strange runes and designs carved within its surface rises from the haze.  Several smaller stones encircle the pillar, and flowers that still bear their roots surround these smaller rocks."
