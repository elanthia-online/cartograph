    "No wider than a hallway, most of the available space in this cramped wagon is taken up by a glass-topped display case.  A series of upturned hooks dots the wall across from the case, the hooks evenly spaced to display an array of robes.  A narrow path leads around the case to the other half of the wagon, while a silver-framed maroon wooden door fills the western wall, leading to a partitioned space."
