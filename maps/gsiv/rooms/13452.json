    "A double row of tall Illistim cypress trees climb the hill to the north, their progress followed by noble houses and artistic gardens.  The edges of the lane are bordered by carved stone balusters topped by large, stone spheres.  Their surface is an old, mottled pattern echoed in the stones paving the lane."
