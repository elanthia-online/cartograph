    "A sea of mist stretches out below to hide the landscape from view.  The cloudy covering extends north, northeast, east and southeast, reflecting the moonlight in a brilliant white blanket.  Here and there groups of trees push up through the mist, appearing as dark islands in the midst of the sea.  To the southeast and north the mists end at expansive forests, while to the northeast and east the confining factors are the tall spires of the DragonSpine Mountains.",
