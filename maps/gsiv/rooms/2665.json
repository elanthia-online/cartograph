  "description": [
    "The colonnaded aisle traverses the central nave, with its omnipotent ice sculpture.  The walls within the long, curved hallway are tall and inset with narrow, rectangular windows placed high, so that beams of light play down on the ice-covered flagstones in distinct ovals.  The repeated columns march away into the shadows, creating a steady rhythm of modulating, ice-covered surfaces, caught in the grip of the implacable cold."
