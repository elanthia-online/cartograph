  "description": [
    "Dimly lit and musty smelling, this area is evidently not intended for guests.  The wide-open space appears to be roughly the size of the manor, but visible areas are neatly sectioned-off, each serving different functional purposes.  A massive chalkboard contains scrawled notes and drawings, most of which are half-erased."
