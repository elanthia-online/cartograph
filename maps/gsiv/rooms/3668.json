    "The soft, soothing sound of the carved marble fountain that dominates Gardenia Commons breaks the omnipresent silence of night.  Bright moonlight dapples the area in a silvery glow and reflects off the water pouring into the fountain, causing ripples of ethereal light to dance across the mist that clings to the cobblestone street.  A light, thin layer of dew glistens on the wrought iron benches that encircle the fountain.",

Bright sunlight dapples the area in a warm glow and reflects off the water pouring into the fountain, causing rainbows of ethereal light to dance across the mist that clings to the cobblestone street.  A light, thin layer of dew glistens on the wrought iron benches that encircle the fountain."
