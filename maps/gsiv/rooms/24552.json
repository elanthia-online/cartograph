    "Carefully laid out tiles direct a small stream that flows out of the bubbling fountain nearby.  The Fountain Table is artfully crafted of copper rods in the form of a hand, fingertips carefully supporting the silvery white marble tabletop.  Several comfortable looking oak chairs stand nearby on the grass, pulled close to the edge of the fountain."
