    "A natural alcove sits in the crook of a sharp dog-leg in the tunnel, its ceiling rising up into a high cone.  Ribs run up the sloped walls, and converge at the apex where they branch into a web of veiny stone tendrils.  The fog turns, floating first one direction then the other, while wisps separate from the cloud to follow the ridges on the walls up a short distance before folding back into the mass."
