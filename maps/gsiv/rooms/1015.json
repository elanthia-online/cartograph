    "The center of the village lies just to the west.  Two buildings and several ratty tents have been constructed on this artificial ledge.  Beyond the settlement, the deep blue sky contrasts with the bland greys of the mountainous landscape.  White clouds, constantly reshaped by the wind pushing them across the jagged summits, gather around the peaks of the mountain ranges on all sides of the valley."
