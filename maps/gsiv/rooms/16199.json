    "A dim corridor stretches into the distance, poorly lit by a single guttering lamp.  Glistening rivulets of condensation run down the rough stone blocks of the walls and soak into the packed dirt floor.  A cluster of slimy mushrooms growing next to a low doorway is the source of the musty odor that pervades the area."
