    "Flowered silk cushions are placed around a low peach marble tea table at the center of the sprawling room.  An enormous driftwood bookcase looms over the varnished mahogany floors that are inlaid with an ornate ivory peony marquetry.  A long, solitary white wall colored in a brilliant mishmash of oil and watercolor paints stands opposite an arched picture window with a scrolling turquoise frame."
