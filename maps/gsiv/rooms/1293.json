    "From these gently sloping hills you can see a vast plain of tall grasses that stretches as far as the eye can see when gazing northward.  To the south lies the eastern stretch of the Dragonsclaw Mountains, a range of rugged snow-capped peaks.  The tallest of these peaks, Zeltoph Mountain, rises to a height of nearly fifteen thousand feet above the level of the sea to the north."
