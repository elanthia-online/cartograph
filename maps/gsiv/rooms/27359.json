    "Large pieces of leather hang from the walls.  The back wall is hung entirely with partially finished hides, many of which still have their arms and legs attached.  Mannequins are scattered around the room, dressed in bits of partially finished armor.  The floor is covered in cedar chips and pine shavings, lending the room a pleasant smell just slightly undercut by the sharp tang of copper."
