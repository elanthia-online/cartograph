    "A crystal chandelier, hanging from the slightly domed ceiling, casts a warm glow over this elegant chamber.  A tall, eahnor-framed mirror stands off to the side of a thickly cushioned settee, which sits before a black marble fireplace.  Cream wallpaper, patterned in diagonal lines of tiny crimson dragonstalks, covers the walls above rich mahogany wainscoting.  A four-poster mahogany bed, flanked by a vaalorn-inlaid wardrobe and a dark mahogany door, rests on the thick, plush crimson carpet and faces a tall, moonlit leaded glass window."
