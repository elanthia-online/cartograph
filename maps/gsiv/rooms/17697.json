    "As you get closer to the base of the large green ash tree, you grow amazed at the size.  The roots are spread out and they push through the circular area of earth surrounding it.  This area feels almost sacred - the leaves rustling in the breeze bring to mind the voices of the gods.  The shade and comfortable grasses are inviting, and you are tempted to sit and enjoy the peacefulness."
