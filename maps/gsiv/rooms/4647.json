    "Colorfully-painted planters brimming with fresh herbs and flowers are supported by wooden poles that are evenly spaced around this open-air platform.  The numerous fragrances of this tiny treetop garden mingle together into a delightful harmony of aroma.  A modwir counter has been topped off with a granite slab, serving as a worktable for creating tinctures, tonics, and other healing concoctions."
