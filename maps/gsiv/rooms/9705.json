    "A large lake stops the trail's progress, closely edged by the trees and thick clumps of cattails.  Here and there, tall knee-like roots rise out of the shallows, where trees have grown so close to the water than their foundations are submerged.  Across the lake, the distant shore is likewise heavily cloaked with forest."
