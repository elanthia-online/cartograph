    "Bright crimson silk drapes the north and west walls of the small chamber, but the curving wall that sweeps from east to south is filled with arched windows open to the sea air.  Sunlight bathes the geometric red-and-gold oak parquet floor with warmth.  Two slim tapestries flank the door to the north, while the west wall is given over to a glass-fronted case of volumes and manuscripts.  A few spindly chairs of brass and wood are tucked into the corners of the room."
