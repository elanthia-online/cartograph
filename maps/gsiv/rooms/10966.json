    "Small windchimes dangle from the overhangs on several domiciles lining the quiet street, clinking against each other to create a natural concert.  Silver Park rolls out to the southeast, dominated by the large carousel at its far end.  A steep hill slopes up against the bushes defining the yards in the neighborhood, providing a sporting venue for the children sledding down them on sheets of metal and many kinds of shields."
