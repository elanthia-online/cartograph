    "Golden tracery runs along the edges of the vaulted ceiling, flowing downwards in a tight spiral along the numerous white columns supporting the room.  Pale, featureless ivory masks are set in niches along the wall, each wrapped in a warm glow by the small candles placed behind them.  A black-veined white marble arch leads west and an arch of golden hue leads east, while a long rich velvet carpet stretches on into a dark corridor."
