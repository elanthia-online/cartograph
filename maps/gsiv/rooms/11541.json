    "A path follows the curve of the steep headland.  A narrow trail leads north into the thick grasses of the moor.  A ship, stark in the moonlit sky, lies careened on the dark, stony beach of the inlet below.  The sound of the waves is barely audible over the rush of the wind through the tall grasses.",
