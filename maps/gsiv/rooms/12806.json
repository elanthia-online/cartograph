    "Occupying the entire western wall of the room is an enormous stained glass window framed in emerald green velvet curtains.  Beneath the window, and illuminated from above by a sea glass chandelier, is a small display case filled with statuettes, artifacts, and tiny jewels.  Floor to ceiling wall shelves on the eastern and western walls are also set with various pieces that are too large for the case, while a pattern divan is set in the center of the room."
