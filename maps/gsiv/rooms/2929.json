    "The trail stops at a small drop-off, then continues northwards into a windswept valley.  There, powdered snow layers the ground, as if a thick carpeting of plush white velvet.  Only a few trees interrupt the uniform perfection of the snowscape.  To the south, a large boulder nearly blocks the trail."
