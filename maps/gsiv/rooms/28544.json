    "Additional wares are tucked away in this nook, with furniture placed in an arrangement that mimics the shop's entry room.  A prominent stout wooden table, with a woven basket propped up against its side, rests atop an area rug covering the floor.  A driftwood shelf lines the back wall directly above a series of display hooks."
