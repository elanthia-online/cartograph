  "description": [
    "The scent of blackberries is thick in the air as the wall of brambles recedes to the southwest, revealing a well lit crowded neighborhood of rough, ramshackle buildings.  Moonlight reflects from the Tempest River to the northwest, giving sight to the sound of the swift-moving north fork of the river.  Several goats curled up next to stacked packages, sleep quietly by the path, resting from a day's work.",

Light reflects from the Tempest to the northwest, giving sight to the sound of the swift-moving north fork of the river.  Small boys traverse the path leading goats laden with bulging sacks toward the neighborhood."
