    "The path almost disappears in the dense underbrush of the forest.  Leafy vines twist around one another to engulf the forest floor.  The looping vines have engulfed the trunks of several nearby oaks in a leafy curtain of green.",
    "The path disappears beneath the dark brush covering the florest floor.  Leafy vines twist together to create a tangled carpet for the forest floor.  Moonlight creates shadows in the mass of vines, giving them a sinister look."
