  "description": [
    "The dense branches of the pine shelter the treehouse from the relentless frigid winds.   The very sturdy platform has been crafted out of oak, the railings around it serving as backrests for those who choose to sit.  Gaps in the branches offer an excellent view of the guild's yard below."
