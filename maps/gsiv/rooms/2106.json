    "This small office has been completely dismantled in a very thorough, if not destructive, fashion.  The drawers from a large desk have been pulled out, and their contents strewn about the room.  Yellowed ledgers, books, and old receipts flutter with each gust of wind that wafts through the building.  A dark stain in the middle of the room appears to be dried ink at first glance, but a vaguely gruesome sense of curiosity makes you look again."
