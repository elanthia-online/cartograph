  "description": [
    "This gallery overlooks the Hall of Magic and Technology.  Robed scholars, wizened researchers and curious browsers clamber noiselessly up and down step stools to retrieve and reshelve the thick, dusty volumes that line the walls from floor to ceiling.  A few lecterns are placed around the circular library. At the far end, a tall, grey, bespectacled figure, obviously the head librarian, peers down at you, ready to pounce at the slightest noise."
