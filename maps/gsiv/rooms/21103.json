    "Dark green moss covers the ground in a thick, spongy blanket that gradually continues up some ruined sandstone walls dotting the area.  A brilliant red and yellow vivid heliconia plant stands proudly next to a wall to the south, its bright colors a refreshing reprieve from the dull greys behind it.  Situated in the middle of the area is a round sandstone table with a young banana tree climbing through a large hole at its center."
