    "The air is cool beneath the portico.  The walkway, made of cream-colored octagonal tiles, retains that coolness.  An exquisite brass lantern hangs from the portico rafters.  To the south the moons shine brightly on a well-tended green lawn and a salmon-colored awning under which rogues of all sizes and races practice their skills."
