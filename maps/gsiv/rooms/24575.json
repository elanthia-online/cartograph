    "Walls of gleaming obsidian arch seamlessly into the ceiling of this room to form a smooth, black dome.  Thousands of shiny silver points glimmer in the firmament above, all of them dwarfed in size by a large, eight-pointed star which shines at the zenith.  A web of filigreed silver emanates from the larger star to touch each of the smaller ones in turn, giving the appearance of a large spider's web arching protectively over the heavens."
