    "A wave of ice looms ominously overhead, reminding one of a waterfall frozen in time.  Tortured visages are carved into the icy deluge, resembling a huge tapestry that depicts a flood of undead horrors.  A marble statue in the middle of the floor stands defiantly against the frozen avalanche, his stoic form bedecked in chainmail.  Light filtering in from the translucent walls ensconces the sculpture in an almost blinding white glow, highlighting his carved expression of absolute determination."
