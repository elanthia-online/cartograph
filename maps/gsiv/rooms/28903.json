  "description": [
    "Hammering, buzzing, and loud voices spill from a tall oak warehouse that dominates the cobblestone road, the sound of industry blotting out all other sounds to the area.  Piles of wooden planks, oilcloth bundled packages, and various crates surround the building, though the entry is left clear and free of debris.  Flaeshorn vines mingle with morning glories around a wrought iron lamppost whose lanterns has been shattered by the invasion of the showy tendrils."
