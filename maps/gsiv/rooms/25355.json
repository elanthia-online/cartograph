    "A gently rolling slope of the ground levels out here near the rear of the estate, and the grass is not quite as green, nor as manicured, as the surrounding lawns.  Still, a pretty white trellis elegantly arches away from the stately back porch of the manor to the backyard gardens, with twining green vines wending their way through the latticework structure."
