  "description": [
    "Shadows dance across this section of the market, which is built against the pockmarked face of a natural slate wall that rises several stories high.  Fruit and vegetable stalls with cheerily decorated awnings create a maze of pathways that lead to and fro upon the painted cobblestones.  A striped pavilion spreads across the westernmost section, its back open to a small garden of herbs and local plants."
