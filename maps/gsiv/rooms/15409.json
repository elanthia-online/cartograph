    "[Sloshed Squid Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A rather strange painting hangs on the wall next to the table, its surface covered with muted colors to form the image of a squid holding a bottle of liquor in one of its tentacles.  The creature's eyes are crossed and from the looks of it, it is drunk.  The small round table bears carvings that mimic the painting, with each of the squid's arms pointing at one of the eight chairs clustered around it."
