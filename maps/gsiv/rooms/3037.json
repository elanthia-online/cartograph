    "A slight grade makes traversing this section of the path a bit more challenging.  The fight to maintain balance has been lost many times, apparent from the shadowy arm-deep holes next to several footsteps.  Several upper level windows glow warmly with a golden light as the rooftops of buildings begin to crest over the city walls from this angle."
