  "description": [
    "A rocky trail leads up the shore of the bluff, which is capped by a stand of pines that have scattered needles and a few cones even down here in the sand.  The current laps softly at the shore, and a brisk bay breeze blows in, bearing the cries of seagulls and the spray of salt air."
