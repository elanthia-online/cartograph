  "description": [
    "This office has been designed with an eye toward function over aesthetics.  The floor is hardwood with a plain black rug covering much of its middle.  A very wide wooden desk sits near the back with a few pieces of scrap leather on its top.  A simple iron corona hangs from the center of the ceiling, holding several pillar candles, which cast ample light on the room."
