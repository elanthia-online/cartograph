    "Four chairs with their backs carved in the shape of sea serpents surround a large oak table.  Under glass covering the top of the table is a large chart of the western coast of the continent.  Sitting in the center of the table are a mithril and brass sextant and a polished brass folding telescope.  A bed sits to one side of the room covered with blue and gold bedding.  Upon the walls hang several pictures of famous sailing ships."
