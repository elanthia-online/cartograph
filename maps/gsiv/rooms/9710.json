    "High in the branches of the oak, the thick growth of limbs, intersecting and crossing, offers an easy passageway between the trees.  The boughs are wide and easily traversed.  Far below, a creek running through the trees on the forest floor is occasionally visible through breaks in the dense foliage.",
    "High in the branches of the oak, the thick growth of limbs, intersecting and crossing, offers an easy passageway between the trees.  The boughs are wide and easily traversed, and the moonlight is brighter here.  Far below, a creek running through the trees on the forest floor is occasionally visible through breaks in the dense foliage."
