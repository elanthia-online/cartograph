    "Hot drafts of air flowing underneath the door of the study create a soft whistling sound that grows and diminishes in intensity with the arrival and departure of every warm breeze.  A dust-laden crystal chalice sits on top of a desk covered with papers and a small bronze astrolabe.  Behind the desk is a narrow stone door."
