    "The open expanse of the tent's interior is complemented by the airy quality of its layered ivory silk construction and peaked ceiling.  Gauzy swathes of golden mesh are scalloped along the upper edge of the walls, held in place at each peak by a spray of milky white lilies.  A lengthy buffet table dominates the left side of the tent, while the remaining space is occupied by half a dozen round tables set with chairs in front of a raised dais.  A myriad of winterberry ale barrels perched on oaken stands rest at the dais' edge."
