    "Carved in the semblance of dolphins standing on their tails, the pylons that rise out of the water and support the distant dock hold a dark blue hue.  Thick and small rocks rise from the shore, making it impossible to bring any kind of water vessel onto the shore, and large signs along the edge of the dock mark the space as reserved for water taxis and ferries.  Lanterns strung from thin ropes between the pylons spill pools of light upon the dark waters below."
