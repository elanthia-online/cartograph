    "The domed ceiling of this room is composed of transparent crystal, revealing the secrets and glory of the sky above.  Beamed supports brushed with gold leaf are fashioned to reflect the light rather than obstruct it, and darkly upholstered chairs offer a place to relax and observe.  Towards the back of the room is a snack-laden bar, in front of which is a row of padded silver bar stools, and a shelf with a trio of hand-painted mugs."
