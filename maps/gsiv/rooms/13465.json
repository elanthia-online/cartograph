    "The pebbled track ends before a group of residences positioned at the northern edge of a bluff.  Tall pines have created a thick carpet of needles that all but covers the trail.  Their fresh, spicy aroma fills the air.  The dwellings have steep roofs and are surrounded by large rhododendrons that sway lazily as breezes swell up and over the cliff's precipice."
