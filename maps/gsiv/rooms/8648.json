    "A multitude of ancient beds, from the delicate to the sturdy and the simple to the ostentatious are set between several objects de art displayed on the walls.  Several comforters lie off to the side, ready to show alternative touches that can be added to the beds with just a bit of work.  A faint, dusty odor is partially masked by a brazier burning lilac-scented incense."
