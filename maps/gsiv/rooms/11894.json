    "This room appears to have been cut directly out of the dark grey granite from which the outer pyramid was composed.  The room forms a six-pointed star that is slightly rounded at the tips.  At the eastern point of the star a marble staircase spirals out of sight to the floor above you, while at the western point a stairway drops to the floor below."
