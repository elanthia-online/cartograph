  "description": [
    "Enclosed by stone walls, a cavernous room with arched ceilings opens at the foot of some extremely narrow spiral stairs leading up into the kitchen.  The cool, still air holds a faintly musty, earthen scent.  Wooden wine barrels sit in stacks, and built into the walls are latticed racks holding countless bottles of wine.  Iron chandeliers cast a twinkling glow over the bottles, setting their rich jewel tones alight, though the cellar is not without its shadowy corners.  Each footfall reverberates throughout the room, disturbing a light coat of dust."
