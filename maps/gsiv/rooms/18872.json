  "description": [
    "As a place to escape from the outside world, the dominating theme of this room is comfort.  A large soft bed waits for its owner's return.  Colorful, yet tastefully selected room furnishings compete with each other for your attention.  An inviting spotted puma throw lies in front of a modest fireplace.  You suspect this is a pleasant place to pass some time and are tempted to do so."
