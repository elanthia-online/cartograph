    "Racks of armor line the walls and mannequins containing the heavier armors stand throughout the room.  Heavy suits of polished plate stand side by side with the hardened leather breastplate of a suit of brigandine.  Each suit of armor in this room appears to have been made by a master armorsmith, but none of it contains the markings of an enchanter.  You also see an iron-bound heavy modwir door."
