    "Wind driven flurries of snow keep vision poor.  Further down the southern face an immense arch is barely visible through the snow.  A narrow trail follows the base of the cliff wall, starting at an icy slope then running towards the northeast.  The slope climbs upwards among the cliffs until it is lost in the clouds."
