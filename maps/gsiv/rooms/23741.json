    "The stone tunnel is aglow with bioluminescent fungus, generating an eerie reflection off the wet, sewage-covered ground.  The air is full of mephitic gasses that create a wavering haze.  Pieces of crumbling stone blocks, slick with sludge, make footing precarious.  Putrid sewage floats in the runoff water gathered in the well."
