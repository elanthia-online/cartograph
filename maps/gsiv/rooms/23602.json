  "description": [
    "Bolted to the deck by thick iron pins is a sheet of blackened, wrought iron.  The long sheet extends from the 'midships stays to the wooden bulwarks, which are interrupted by a heavy wooden ballista.  Weathered copper plates cap the carved railing on either side of the ballistae, the corroded metal leaving a verdigris trail down the sun-bleached wood of the railing."
