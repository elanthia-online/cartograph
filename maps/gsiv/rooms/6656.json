    "A large globe casts an eerie light from its position on the ceiling in the center of the room.  A weapon rack stands to either side of the iron-bound door on the south side of the chamber.  Four bunks occupy the room, with a footlocker resting at the end of each.  A large circular table with six chairs surrounding it sits near the northern wall.  Mounted over the table is a large crimson vaalin symbol of Sheru."
