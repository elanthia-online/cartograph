  "description": [
    "Someone is constructing a building just to the south of the roadway.  A stone base supports thick plank flooring and tall beams.  The skeleton of a roof arches high overhead, and the height of the roof suggests that this is not a home under construction.  Piles of building materials dot the clearing, although no work is being performed right now, and quite a bit of snow has filtered into the work area."
