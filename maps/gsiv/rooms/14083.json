    "A huge white oak towers above, dwarfing the surrounding hemlocks and sycamores.  Its widely spreading branches reach out around it in an expansive diameter.  The top must reach up more than 130 feet.  The bark is a pale shade of grey, deeply fissured with age.  A stair is built against it in matching oak wood, wrapping around the massive trunk in an elegant spiral.  It leads up into the lower branches where a platform is visible."
