    "A deep crevasse slices its way across the face of the titanic mountain, tearing further into the glacier with every shift of the moving ice.  Great walls of ice break off and tumble down into the frozen canyon.  Several seconds pass before the crash of the blocks hitting bottom can be heard over the winds."
