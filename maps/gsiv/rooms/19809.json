    "White marble columns shot with thin crimson veins ascend toward the ceiling, their colossal forms arranged in a circular pattern.  Four main halls branch off in the cardinal directions, the gaps of the towering columns serving as an entranceway toward each.  A huge disc of pure crimson eahnor is inlaid into the floor, its surface bearing elaborate, looping designs of lustrous gold across its entire circumference."
