    "The sounds of the sea echo through a window along the southern wall, its edges worn from years of exposure to the elements.  Opposite the window is a bronze fire cauldron, which appears to be in fairly good condition.  Drops of water occasionally fall to the floor with a gentle splash, joining the streams that flow to the east through the elaborately designed grooves in the floor."
