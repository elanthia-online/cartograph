    "Steel-banded oak kegs are stacked against the far wall, creating a backdrop for a dicing game in progress.  A pair of glass-eyed mannequins are stationed by the door, their gaze seeming to follow you around the room.  An overturned bin and an opened crate provide makeshift seating in one dark corner."
