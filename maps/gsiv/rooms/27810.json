    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the thick slate walls, and a weathered dark birch ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of unmarked crates sits in one corner of a solid plank ebonwood floor.  There is an ora-bound large walnut trunk on one side of the shop and a dented iron footlocker on the other."
