    "The dimly lit hallway opens up into a wide spherical chamber with a smooth, dark slate floor.  Maoral-framed paintings enhance the russet-hued walls, and arched windows provide a profusion of silvery moonlight.  Ceramic pots of white gardenia rest between a silver arch, a brass arch and a gold arch."
