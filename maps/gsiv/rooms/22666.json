    "Crumbling limestone soars overhead, spanning outward from a low, boulder-blocked passageway into an expansive cavern area that is largely wrapped in darkness.  Red spots, painted at various intervals, splatter across the walls, each centered with a long steel spike driven into the limestone.  Stretched between three adjacent spikes, a long coil of rope is draped with various hats.  At the very edge of the wan torchlight, where the ground suddenly drops away, the top of a narrow ladder is barely visible."
