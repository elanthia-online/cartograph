    "Two huge columns flank either side of a walkway that leads out past the city walls.  Each column is miraculously intact, but so badly tilted that they lean against each other in a precarious equilibrium, forming a triangular arch over the opening.  A road leading north and south runs past the opening, and a large square plaza extends out to the west."
