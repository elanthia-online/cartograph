  "description": [
    "Stretching north from the hallway entrance, the white birch-paneled corridor leads into the more private areas of the villa.  On the western wall, an oak-framed landscape painting hangs beside a pale green birch door, while on the opposite wall, a rounded oak arch leads into a dimly lit room.  Running up the center of the pale birch floorboards is a muted burgundy rug with a faint golden pineapple design.  Polished crystal sconces set into narrow niches in the wall supply the windowless hall with ample candlelight."
