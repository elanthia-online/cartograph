    "Blood stains the floor of the chamber, surrounding a raised platform in the center of the room.  A glowing violet mote floats above a colossal granite sepulcher.  A faintly glowing exit within the mist serves as the only egress from the castle, as the black ora door is completely surrounded by a magical barrier from this side of the chamber."
