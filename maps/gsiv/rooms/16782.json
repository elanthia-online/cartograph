    "Bands of snowy white creep through the red marble in this room, making it a bit brighter than the others.  The perfectly polished surfaces throw light around in bewildering patterns.  Movement just at the edge of your field of vision distracts you, and you cannot be sure if it is something to fear or merely your own transformed reflection."
