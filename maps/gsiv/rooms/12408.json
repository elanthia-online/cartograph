    "A mixed group of ragamuffins, elven, human and halfling, collect lumps of mud and small rocks.  Their leader, a red-headed, mud-caked elven girl perhaps nine years old, points to the southeast with excitement, urging her friends to hurry.  An old, piebald mule tied to a post regards the scene with disinterest."
