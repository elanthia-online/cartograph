    "Sparsely covered trees sway in the slight breeze, causing shadows to play across the fetid, stagnant water.  Thick green algae obscure the hidden depths of the swamp, while slender reeds poke out of the mire in the shallower areas.  A faint buzzing originates around a rotting tree, from the tiny black flies that flit about in search of a meal."
