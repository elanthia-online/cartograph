    "The packing crate pavement of Barter and Trade Alleys widen into a broad if unimpressive plaza in front of the sturdy tower in the southeast corner of Icemule Trace.  A few halfling militia guards patrol the square at all hours, but most of the people in view have more important matters in mind:  doing business with one of the many small merchants whose shops stand in the shadow of the tower."
