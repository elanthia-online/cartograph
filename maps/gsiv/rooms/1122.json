    "A sheer rock wall and a nasty drop prevent any movement to the north or east.  Clambering up a canyon farther into the scrub hills appears to be the only way to find passage in that direction.  The trail meanders northwest into more of the same sparse deciduous forest.  The trees here live on the edge of existence, perhaps sending their roots deep enough to tap the water from the creek that can be heard down below the drop-off."
