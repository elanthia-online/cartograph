    "Glowing with a pale, luminescent light, a large pool practically gleams in the dark area.  Rock walls hug the vicinity, the ceiling low and dripping with tiny drops of greenish water.  Streaks of a bronze-colored mineral zigzag from a naturally formed arch to a length of rope hanging from a series of spikes set into the walls.  An oddly twisted door handle is nailed into the floor."
