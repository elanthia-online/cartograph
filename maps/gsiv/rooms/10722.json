  "description": [
    "A large patch of brambles engulfs this section of the boneyard, a nasty surprise for those careless in their nighttime travels.  The long thorns mix with sharpened bones to create a dangerous display.  The broken remains of an ancient rowboat have nearly been consumed by the thorny vines.",
