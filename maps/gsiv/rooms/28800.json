  "description": [
    "Beneath a prominent golden maple sign, a grate of nigh-impenetrable vultite protects a box run by a pair of hunch-shouldered kobolds and a snooty green goblin.  Behind them are burlap sacks filled with coins in various denominations and precious metals.  Hanging from the ceiling is a glimaerstone-set chandelier of gold shaped into a firebird with its claws extended."
