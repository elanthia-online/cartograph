    "[The Penitent Petitioner]"

  "description": [
    "Tucked against a crumbling wall and sheltered by large squares of oiled canvas, the small enclosure is swept clean of debris and the rough cobblestones of the road are scrubbed completely clean.  Burning tallows rest upon stones that have been tugged free of the wall to make tiny shelves, their slender waxy bodies bound in place by the melted remains of previous occupants.  Two alcoves, one draped in azure and gold and the other in ebon and silver, are lined with prayer benches for the penitent."
