    "Standing out from the main trail, columns of grey-blue marble streaked with pyrite and serpentine support a pale haon cross-beam roof.  Spiraled cypress trees stand tall, extending out like wings from two sides of the arbor.  Nearby, the soft sound of Leaping Falls serves as a backdrop to the view of the starlit sky extending out above.",

Nearby, the soft sound of Leaping Falls serves as a backdrop to the view of the open meadow extending out in front.  Soaring hawks dive and turn, riding the thermals rising up at the canyon walls."
