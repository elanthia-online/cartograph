    "A sense of relief and anticipation pervades the softly-lit tent.  The makeshift room, small and crowded with the ill and wounded, contains the astringent odor of balms and ungents.  Old rugs depicting the healing powers of various deities and magical practices lie on the ground.  At the far end of the tent stands a long, padded table.",
