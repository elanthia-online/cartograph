    "Winding slightly, the passageway narrows and descends sharply, plunging deeper into the rock below the fortress.  The chalky white tufa walls funnel the faint violet glow in from the west, precluding the need for a light source.  The soft lighting and cool, earthy smell provide a calm alternative to the bustle of the fortress above."
