  "description": [
    "Situated in a small cove, the dark blue waters of the swimming area bounce of the shore and ripple calmly through the secluded harbor.  A protective ring of rocks near the opening of the cove prevents larger sea denizens from entering the area and also keeps the tide from growing too strong.  Rhythmic and persistent, the surf crashes on the sands of the distant beach and creates undulating waves to float upon."
