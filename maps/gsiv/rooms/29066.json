  "description": [
    "Inside the tall boundary of impenetrable briars enclosing the village, a makeshift fence of lashed conifer boughs surrounds a simple stick and vine hut.  Panels of green and yellow canvas have been nailed across the doorway, and the roof and walls are fashioned from sawed-off saplings, bound with lengths of twisted vines.  A mound of discarded food scraps nearby draws the attention of a few scavenging rodents."
