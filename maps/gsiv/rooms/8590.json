    "The mountains to the east taper off towards the south, dense underbrush marking the transition between upland and plain.  The east flank of the castle compound, its walls, and the drawbridge over the moat, suspended in mid-air, are visible from the crest of this small hummock.  The skeletal remains of an old catapult, a fossil of some past siege, stand in the center of the high ground."
