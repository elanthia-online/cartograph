    "The iron-shod door guards a trove of treasures from across the continent.  Racks of skillfully forged weapons run down the center of the room, with finely crafted armors arrayed upon one wall and bolts of costly fabrics and finely tailored garments hanging upon the facing wall.  Along the far wall is a tall chest of slender drawers, a few of which are open, revealing gleaming jewelry and arcane instruments."
