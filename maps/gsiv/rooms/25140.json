    "A trail of sooty footprints mars the otherwise perfect white marble leading up to a narrow window.  On either side of the window, lightless torches are hung evenly on whitewashed walls.  Carved into the wall surrounding the window is the depiction of a devolving man, one side of his body a soupy mess."
