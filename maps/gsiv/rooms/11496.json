    "An open archway leads west directly into the high tower.  The archway, adorned with mottled pink and white shells, shows the signs of ancient damage and small weeds and wildflowers have taken root in the wide cracks.  Barely visible near the top of the interior of the arch are the sharpened spikes of a portcullis, now firmly corroded in place by the salty air.  A gentle breeze scatters fine-grained sand throughout the courtyard."
