    "A well-tended rose garden borders the north side of the pathway.  Raised beds of cultivated roses are arranged in an elegant tiered pattern, allowing passersby to admire the variety of hues displayed by the blooms.  Each bush holds at least one perfect bloom, and the fragrance of roses permeates the air."
