  "description": [
    "Moonlight streams into the room from the skylights cut in the coral stone ceiling, casting a silvery hue on the tropical hardwood floor.  The enormous space is sparsely but elegantly furnished, with a black marble platform bed and matching vanity as the most prominent features.  A narrow coral stone staircase leads up to a small landing with a door opening out onto the roof, while a wider white spiral staircase leads downstairs."
