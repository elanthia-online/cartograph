  "description": [
    "A large maoral table dominates the room, making the narrow bed in the corner seem almost an afterthought.  Shards of crystal litter the floor from the remains of a broken vase, which probably once contained the dead lilies scattered beside a small, ornate trunk.  Dried ink glues several scrolls and diagrams to the table's scarred surface, but the same ink that holds the scrolls has stained them into illegibility."
