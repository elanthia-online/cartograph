    "The cobblestone road leads straight and true, north and south.  The thick trunks of firs, pines, spruces, cedars, and even the occasional redwood line the roadway, scattering off to the east and west as far as one can see.  Their branches intertwine overhead, allowing light to filter down to the ground but blocking any clear view of the sky above.  A thick layer of needles covers the roadway, only scuffed away in places by the passage of those who have gone before."
