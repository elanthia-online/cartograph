  "description": [
    "About midway between the full height of the steep cliff above and the barely visible flatlands below, the trail is reasonably flat and wide through these surroundings.  Openings and outcroppings along the cliff wall provide secure spots where those who are prey can hide and predators can await their chance to ambush.  Relentless winds off the ocean howl loudly across the flat and rock-strewn terrain."
