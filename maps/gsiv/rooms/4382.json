  "description": [
    "The small natural cavern is shored up at intervals with petrified wood beams carved in deep relief.  Leafy garlands spiral about a pair of stalagmites and fringe their cropped tops, which themselves are hollowed into basins filled with brightly colored beads.  Curtains of ribbons and dangling chips of semi-precious stone drape two wrought iron archways set into the northeastern and northwestern walls of the chamber."
