    "Rounded walls, ceiling and floor of slick, solid white ice make this otherwise simple corridor quite hard to navigate.  The subtle glow of a torch to the west provides enough light to see the outlines of an iron-shod wooden door to the south and the imflass bars of a cell door to the north.  One end of the hallway stretches farther to the west, while the other ends in a circular opening that leads to a suspended rope bridge uneasily spanning a narrow chasm."
