    "Iron torches, lining the length of the domed hall, bathe the room with a soft, warm glow.  The white marble floor is covered with plush woven rugs and aged silk tapestries hang from golden cords on the rear wall.  Erected in the center of the room, on a slighty raised platform, a golden statue of an intricate luminescent globe rests upon mithril supports."
