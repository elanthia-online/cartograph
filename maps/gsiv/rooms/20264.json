  "description": [
    "The scent of peat and decaying leaves drift upwards from nearby swamp waters, wafting on currents of humid air.  Toward the outer areas, a stand of moss-bearded trees keep silent watch on their surroundings.  Knees protrude around them like knobby, gnarled daggers piercing the glassy surface of the waters."
