    "A pair of birch saplings is set into a bed of white roses, their fragile, spindly boughs a meager barrier between the dark night sky above and the pale flowers below.  Across the cobblestones from the young trees, a few larger buildings are interspersed with the collection of smaller shops that have grown up around them.",
