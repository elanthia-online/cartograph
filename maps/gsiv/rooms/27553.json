    "Roughly cobbled stones form a concentric circle around the crumpled remains of an old well, which issues a wide variety of gurgling and splashing sounds.  Dark sands and crushed shells are scattered upon the ground, which is riddled with tufts of grass, dried seaweed, and partially rotted fish carcasses.  At the edges of the small village center, broken timber and ancient beams lay forgotten in the new growth.",

At the edge of the small village center, a modest abode is surrounded by newly cultivated gardens."
