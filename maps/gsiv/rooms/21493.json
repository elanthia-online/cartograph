    "Lopsided crates and discarded packaging paper is strewn about on the ground, cluttering the area terribly, the uneven flooring barely visible through the mess.  A lone canvas cot remains clear of debris, resting in the far corner of this crude shanty, below a single flickering lantern.  A crooked pine-planked door appears to be the only exit to this cramped space."
