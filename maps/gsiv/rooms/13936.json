    "One building dominates the area, its imposing fel doors and wide, shuttered windows drawing as much attention as the two elven guards in navy and grey livery that greet customers and open the heavy doors.  Commercial establishments, their doors now closed tightly until the new day, make up the rest of the block.  Small redwood planters containing topiaries demarcate the boundaries between shops.",
    "One building dominates the area, its imposing fel doors and wide, shuttered windows drawing as much attention as the two elven guards in navy and grey livery that greet customers and open the heavy doors.  Commercial establishments, their wares spread on portable carts and tables in front of them, make up the rest of the block.  Small redwood planters containing topiaries demarcate the boundaries between shops and help to control both noise and traffic flow on the wey."
