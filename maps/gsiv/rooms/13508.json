    "Providing ample view of a lower-story hall to the north, the gallery extends to the eastern wall before declining into a sharp northwesterly slope.  Inlay in the earth-hued eastern wall picks out the image of a large golden anvil.  Smoke's dry odor lingers heavy on the air, accompanied by the biting tang of hot metal."
