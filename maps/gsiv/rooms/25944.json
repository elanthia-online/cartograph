    "Acorns litter the walkway, the bounty of the oak trees lining both sides of the path.  Squirrel's nests are plentiful in the oaks' branches, and other fauna have made themselves at home in this perfect pocket of woodland habitat.  A bench carved of fallen wood sits at the path's edge, allowing rest and the opportunity to observe the wildlife."
