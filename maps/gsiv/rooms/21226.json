    "Thick carpeting muffles your footsteps and warms this room.  A small window in the western wall overlooks a courtyard far below and the forest beyond.  Simply furnished, there is a single table and a straight-backed chair resting at the window.  A wide carpeted staircase leads back to the lounge far below."
