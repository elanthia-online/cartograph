    "Strong, acrid scents rise from the surf as it crashes against a low stone wall that separates the southern edge of the street from the waters of the harbor.  Sandwiched between two buildings, a small alley provides quick access to the north, while a sandy pathway leads to the beaches in the east.  Wild ducks, their sporadic quacking filling the air, swim in the cool waters and occassionally beg for treats.",
