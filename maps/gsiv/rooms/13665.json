    "Textured green silk walls rise from a plain cherrywood floor.  Just above a serene golden wyvern fountain hangs a noble elf maiden portrait, and a high arched ceiling completes the picture.  A clawfooted cherrywood table and an intricately carved ebonwood stand stand side by side in the middle of the room."
