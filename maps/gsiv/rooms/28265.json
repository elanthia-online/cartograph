  "description": [
    "A statue of a slumbering dragon resides in the center of the table, its tail curled around a slender oil lamp that casts a pool of soft light over the recumbent beast's treasure.  The smell of freshly baked breads and the low murmur of conversations from surrounding tables are the only intrusions on your privacy."
