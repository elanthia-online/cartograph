  "description": [
    "South Ring Road leads to the outskirts of Shanty Town, the poorest section of Wehnimer's Landing.  The contrast between the colorful, well-kept buildings of the bazaar and main square and the dingy hovels to the east is striking.  Most passers-by move hurriedly to the west or north to the river crossing.  A ragged child cowers against the south wall, looking lost and forgotten."
