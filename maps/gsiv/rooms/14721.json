    "Several rush lights hang from the high ceiling which tops this perfectly square room.  Thick wooden beams support the ceiling at the corners and in the exact midpoint of each wall.  In the middle of the room is a heavy desk, built to completely surround the wooden beam that rises right through its center up to the ceiling."
