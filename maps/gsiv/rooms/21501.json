  "description": [
    "A tall stone pedestal has been placed within a wide circle of oversized flat-topped rocks that creates a natural seating area.  Displayed prominently on the platform is a black marble moon, held in place by silver pegs that border the edges of the cornice.  A wooden shovel lays on the ground next to a freshly dug hole, brown worms writhing in and out of the moist earth.  A circular archway leads back into the wagon."
