    "A fallen pillar of grey stone lies half-hidden under a patch of windswept brambles, broken into many pieces by the force of its fall and the forces of nature.  A constant, faint howl seems to fill the air, and whether it is the howling of the chill wind or of some distant ghostly creature is difficult to tell."
