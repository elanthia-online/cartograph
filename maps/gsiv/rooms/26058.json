    "A light draft stirs the banners draped overhead, each measure of silk representing a knight of the Order.  Dominating the room is a massive oak table with a dozen tall chairs around it.  Three smaller tables are set up in an alcove off the eastern wall for more private gatherings.  Elaborate figurines of former members line the mantle of a huge fireplace set at the far end of the room.  Flanking the hearth, floor-to-ceiling shelves hold a wide selection of reading material and ancient tomes."
