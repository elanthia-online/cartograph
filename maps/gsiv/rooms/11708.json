  "description": [
    "The wall abruptly stops its procession between east and west and turns north, followed by the narrow footpath beaten into the adjacent ground.  The corner of the wall allows a view of the land to the north, beyond the keep, consisting of nothing more than desolate, fog-shrouded fens and marshes."
