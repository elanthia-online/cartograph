  "description": [
    "Sunlight and heat waft off the sandy dunes where tufts of grass obscure the ocean view, though it does little for the sound of the rhythmically lapping waves.  Sand clutters the southern edges of the cobblestone street, the glittering dust collecting around the various lanterns set at even intervals.  Fresh paint decorates a sprawling structure built within a white fence and manicured lawns, a painted at the entry proclaiming it to as \"Sailor's Solace.\"  Situated in the curve of a fork in the road is a dark-shingled white oak shop."
