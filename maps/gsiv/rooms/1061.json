    "Boulders thrust up at odd angles through the grasses, protruding in dark shapes against the grey carpet.  The mist keeps everything covered in a watery layer, making passage through the grasslands wet, cold and uncomfortable.  No wind stirs the blades of grass that stand stiffly upright with only a slight lean at the tops, bunched thickly enough to prevent anything resembling a tree from gaining a foothold in this area.",
