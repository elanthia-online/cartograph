  "description": [
    "Remnants of dried grass and various fauna crumble on either side of a towering gate, the once green foliage buried beneath piles of grey-tinged rubble.  Worn stone blocks form a makeshift wall to frame the entrance, the pieces chipped and caked with what appears to be dried sanguine-mixed mud.  A heavily dented greathelm leans against the right wall, a flash of yellowed bone hidden beneath the spear-pierced visor."
