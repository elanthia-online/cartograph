    "The Walk of the Shaman is a high-ceilinged corkscrew of a corridor, climbing so steeply that passage along it would be dangerous if not for the piles of rubble to use as footholds.  On either side, the walls are densely carved with a veneer of sigils, which appear to shift and pulsate in the gloomy light.  The air is thick with dust, adding to the surreal atmosphere of the skewed concourse."
