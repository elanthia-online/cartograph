    "Laterite flagstones polished to the dull sheen of watered silk span the stretch of low ground from the southern tower's arch to the steps of an opulent temple north of here.  The building's marble inlays and ornate bas-reliefs glimmer in the moonlight and graceful statues, males on one side of the bridge and females on the other, uphold a balustrade worn smooth by time and pilgrims' hands."
