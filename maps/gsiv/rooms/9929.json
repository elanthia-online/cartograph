  "description": [
    "The rough brambles of the underbrush and the sturdier branches of the overhanging trees fill the dark thicket with a nearly impassable mass of tortuous vegetation.  A glistening black spider crouches in her irregular web amid the sharp-thorned bushes, and a pitted, moss-covered headstone marks the location of a long-forgotten grave."
