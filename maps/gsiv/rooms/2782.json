    "The room is aromatic, scented with bunches of herbs that hang from the beamed ceiling like garland.  An oak counter is cluttered with glass canisters filled with all sorts of powders and leaves, and a bed sits against the far wall, the two pieces being the room's only furnishings.  A window sporting a white linen drape offers a view of the snowy landscape.",
