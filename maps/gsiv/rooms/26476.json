  "description": [
    "Lustrous black seawaters cradle the entire stone structure with harsh waves crashing against the craggy basin below.  Shards of phosphorite and flagstone have been stamped into a narrow pathway along the fractured ridges climbing the bowed back of the cave.  A particularly prominent circlet of gnarled rock caps the highest stony spire, filtering the ambient breezes that whip through the heartstopping viewpoint."
