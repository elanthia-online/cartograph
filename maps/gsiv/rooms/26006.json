    "A counter, carved out of the surrounding stone, is overlaid with a slab of polished ultramarine glimaerstone.  Two matching wall-hung shelves, laden with shoe lasts and with sample pieces, stare each other down across an open space in the middle of the cavern.  A pair of chairs and a small table complete the collection of furniture."
