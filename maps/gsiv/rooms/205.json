    "A lovely garden lines one side of the var, with several cottages on the opposite side.  A striped awning protects a spot of grass in the nearby garden, a lovely spot for an afternoon picnic.  Several elves stroll about the garden as they enjoy the pleasantness of the day.",
    "A lovely garden lines one side of the var, with several cottages on the opposite side.  Moonlight washes the garden in an ethereal, silvery light, casting the ground in shadow beneath the gracefully designed beds.",
    "A pocket garden is tucked back into one side of the var, with several small marble-clad homes illuminated by lanterns on the opposite side.  A striped sapphire-on-silver awning protects a spot of grass in the nearby plot.",
