    "Howling wind bursts out into a vast cavern deep within the bowels of the island.  A cataclysmic struggle rages below you, throwing up as much light as the noonday sun, and far more heat.  A river of lava flows through, pooling in a natural cauldron at the center.  Waves pour into this elemental stew, instantly turning into steam and joining the whirling winds above.  The chamber is capped with a great stone grate of sorts, stone masonry with dozens of man-sized holes through which the steam passes."
