    "A haze of wan cyan light filters into this chamber, washing over dark forms on shelves and crags in the wall, setting all aglow with a preternatural luminescence.  On a ledge shorn from the stone wall are a pair of heavy pewter chalices and pewter flare-lipped bowls, neatly arranged on a dusty drape of silvery grey velvet.  As the slight incline of a ramp leads further into the chamber, a heavy stone arch guards the exit."
