    "A low opening yawns like a gaping mouth at the junction of the tunnel.  It resembles a typical burial niche, and nothing distinguishes it aside from a pair of faded and torn standards serving as sentinels.  Granite walls glazed with moisture glitter in the dim light, the water enhancing the micaceous surface."
