    "Encircling a multitude of dilapidated chairs, mangled copper handrails hang futilely from a glassless-windowed circumference of wooden plank walls.  Dominating the center of the hall, a warped three-legged table intermittently teeters on the soft, rotted wood deck.  A pitted copper canopy overhead blocks out most of the sky."
