    "To the east, the surroundings become progressively less rocky.  Rose bushes perfume the air with their heavy scent.  Verdant vines surround a small shrine against the wall.  A few bouquets of maidenhair fern and roses are propped in front of the shrine, interspersed with several lit votive candles.",
    "To the east, the surroundings become progressively less rocky.  Rose bushes, blooming riotously in a variety of colors, spring from the ground and creep tenaciously through the rocky outcroppings.  Verdant vines surround a small shrine against the wall.  A few bouquets of maidenhair fern and roses are propped in front of the shrine."
