    "Plush, dark green carpeting underfoot complements the stained oak wainscot of this light and airy landing.  Along one wall you see a heavy oak sideboard.  Two crystal vases with arrangements of fresh cut flowers adorn each end of the sideboard and their reflections in a mirror above fill the room with their color.  The delicate scent of the flowers intermingles pleasantly with the smell of freshly polished woodwork."
