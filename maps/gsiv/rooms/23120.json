    "Torches, each lit with a dark violet flame, are affixed upon the granite walls.  Standing in the center of the undercroft is a limestone sarcophagus, which is surrounded by piles of rubble.  The smell of dried blood wafts throughout the tomb, becoming more potent toward the tunnel.  Along the northern wall, a twisting granite staircase leads up toward the surface."
