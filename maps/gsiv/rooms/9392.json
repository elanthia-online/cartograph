    "Piles of hides and furs of various animals lie behind a sturdy pine table that stretches nearly the length of the room.  Vadil the skinner sits on a tall stool behind the long table, glancing down his nose at customers as they arrive and depart.  Skins hang from hooks on the walls, and animal tails and lizard skins dangle from the rafters just out of reach."
