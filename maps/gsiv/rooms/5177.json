    "From this bridge, the view of the falls to the east is wondrous.  Lush green trees border the falls atop the cliff face, and grass clings to the black, sandy banks of the delta.  Moonlight illuminates the crashing falls, providing a breathtaking silvery display which dazzles the eye in contrast to the black sands of the beach.",
    "From this bridge, the view of the falls to the east is wondrous.  Lush green trees border the falls atop the cliff face, and deep emerald-green grasses cling to the black, sandy banks of the delta.  Rainbows hover over the crashing falls, providing a breathtaking display of color which dazzles the eye in contrast to the black sands of the beach."
