  "description": [
    "The air is thick with the scents of various dishes being prepared.  A large chunk of meat roasts on a spit over an open flame, while several pots simmer on the stove.  Hot and noisy, the room bustles with activity as wait staff and chefs vie for position among the tight walkways and in front of equipment.  Offering exit from the room are a gold-edged ebonwood door and a swinging door, the latter of which is used often by staff coming from and going into the bistro."
