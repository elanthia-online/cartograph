    "This shop is small and cramped.  Some wooden storage boxes are strewn about the room, some still nailed shut and others on their sides, empty.  There are parallel rowas of vultite hooks on every wall, from which a number of backpacks, rucksacks, and other large containers hang out for display.  A battered old chest sits against the far wall.  The room is illuminated by several large lanterns mounted at the center of each of the room's walls."
