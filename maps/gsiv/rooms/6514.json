    "Brush and boulders cloak a sharp embankment on the road's southern shoulder.  On one of the rocks, a large snake sleeps, its impressive length curled into a sinuous pile of spotted coils.  It lifts its head briefly, responding to vibrations on the road, then settles back into its unconcerned slumber, confident in the protection of its venomous defenses.  The road turns to the southeast, following the curve of a stand of conifers.",
