    "Dust motes, dancing in the slanted rays of light with each creak of the gently rolling ship, drift down from the exposed oaken beams supporting the decking overhead.  Hanging from a hook on the splintered portside bulkhead is a single brass lantern, its flickering light casting odd shadows across the crooked deck planks.  Standing next to the lantern, in obvious need of repair, is a misshapen harpoon rack."
