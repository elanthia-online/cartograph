    "Fallen leaves dot the rich soil in piles of no certain pattern, their wet, decaying presence adding a musty smell to the stale and humid air.  Flowers bloom from creeping vines wrapped around the trunks of various trees, their exotic hues providing a splash of striking color against the lush, verdant surroundings.  An occasional butterfly or hummingbird flutters near them, partaking of the sweet nectar they provide, before moving on to the next."
