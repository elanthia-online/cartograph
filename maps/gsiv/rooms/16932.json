    "Gilded rosewood-framed mirrors on the eastern wall reflect a panoramic view of the sunlit garden seen through a line of tall glass doors across the room.  Sparkling crystal chandeliers cast pinpoints of prismatic light at the stylized pattern of crimson and ivory squares of the polished marble floor.  An elaborate marble archway in the south wall faces an enormous marble fireplace across the length of the room.  The archway is flanked by a carved teak bar and a low teak stage.",
