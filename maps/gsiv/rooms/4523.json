    "Occasional gouts of thick smoke and fumes leak from the seals off a large pipe that runs out of the northern wall and then up through the ceiling.  Hot gases waft about the room, stinging your eyes and making it hard to breathe.  A large armor rack adorns the south wall, while a stout oak table occupies the center of the room."
