  "description": [
    "A rough angled ceiling of thin iron plates arcs overhead, and light filters in through a large horizontal notch cut into the northern wall, a ballista aligned in front of it.  Planks of wood make up the sturdy albeit rough floor, and a grouping of arrow slits surround the central horizontal window."
