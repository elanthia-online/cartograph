    "Standing to either side of a pair of stained glass doors are two white marble urns filled with a variety of blooming flowers.  A richly woven mat runs the length of the pristine white floor, stopping just before some porch steps.  Several wind chimes hang from the porch, catching the smallest breeze, while the sunlight glitters off the contents of a small wooden table covered with gold silk."
