  "description": [
    "The path rolls downward and dives into the bog to the northwest.  The path becomes wet and soft as large puddles of water gather underfoot.  Plants choke and die from lack of soil in the bog, while the path provides purchase to small, diseased brush.  The root work of the dying plants is probably all that provides any stability to the path."
