    "The sweet scent of honeyed berries and floral fruits wafts through the air, the aroma seeming to originate from a small, modest store tucked between two larger buildings.  The store's roof is thatched, and a sooty brick chimney rises from the center.  Planters of bright morning glories and hyacinth sit at the ends of each of the steps that lead up to a narrow porch enclosed by decorative railings.  A scalloped banner hangs from one of the railings, its decoration simple, but colorful."
