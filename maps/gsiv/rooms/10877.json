    "Ancient olive trees, their trunks as thick and rough as the hands of old fishermen, line the pathway.  Lanterns hanging among the thick, grey-green leaves give off a pallid light.  The lanterns in the more distant trees look like fireflies.  Scattered among the trees are a few small, pastel-colored stucco buildings.",
