    "The second floor opens onto a parlor outfitted with burnished acacia moldings that frame the high ceilings and baseboards.  Untouched by the elements, a peridot green wool-covered divan is adorned with a pair of ruched bronze silk pillows.  A colossal, perfectly articulated yierka skull stares out vacantly from above some riveted black ora doors."
