    "The ceiling of this large, circular chamber carved in the ochre-hued sandstone narrows as it rises to a narrow aperture directly overhead.  A complex cluster of lenses and prisms at the apex collects the starlight from above and sends it down in soft beams to the seven workshops along the periphery of the room, each set apart from the others by makeshift partitions of heavy silk rugs slung over wood frames.  The symmetry of the room is broken only by a roughly triangular opening in the eastern wall.",

A complex cluster of lenses and prisms at the apex collects the sunlight from above and sends it down in brilliant beams to the seven workshops along the periphery of the room, each set apart from the others by makeshift partitions of heavy silk rugs slung over wood frames.
