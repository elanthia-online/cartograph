    "The flat tier mirrors its sister above, dotted with bubbling pools of liquid death, like some malevolent garden made by the god of brimstone and fire.  Stark basalt fingers jut out of the landscape, casting crooked shadows.  The odor of sulfur is near to overpowering, hemmed in by the cliff walls on the eastern side of the plateau."
