  "description": [
    "Barely larger than a closet, the storage space is packed with shipping crates, broken boxes, and even a few long, slender containers that could be coffins.  The wood-paneled walls are covered in cobwebs, and the floor is buried under a healthy layer of dirt.  A narrow arch leads back to the main room."
