  "description": [
    "Jewel-toned tapestries on the walls and woven rush mats on the floor keep the stone chamber's cold at bay and hold in the heat of the fireplace that takes up most of the spacious room's west wall.  On the eastern wall, mullioned windows with ornamental stained glass rosettes open onto a commanding view of the castle's grounds.  A massive four-poster bed heaped with bolster pillows and furs holds pride of place in the center of the vaulted bedchamber."
