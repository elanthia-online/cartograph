  "description": [
    "The Willow Hall armory is a generous chamber with glistening blades neatly arranged along the uppermost levels of built-in wooden shelves around its walls.  Suits of leather and armor, mostly battle-worn from years of use, hang from pegs interspersed among the banks of shelves.  The many items donated by members of the Hall testify to the valor and honor common to the clansmen who once owned them."
