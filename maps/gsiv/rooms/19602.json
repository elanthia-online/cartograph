    "Sheltered from the full fury of the sea by a ring of rocks, the cove's small beach is quiet and glitters with the golden sunlight that filters through the puffy white clouds above.  Tall dunes swallow the path as it ambles upward, their edges covered in high beach grasses and wild dog roses.",
    "Sheltered from the full fury of the sea by a ring of rocks, the cove's small beach is quiet and illuminated by dozens of torches.  Moonlight flickers across the tips of the tall grasses that line the path as it ambles through the dunes and past wild dog roses towards the summit."
