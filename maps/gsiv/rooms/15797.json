    "The slick, icy floor provides an unstable purchase to this tiny, cramped office.  The uneven walls and ceiling are formed of a mix of transparent and milky white ice reinforced with heavy iron strips.  Three iron sconces holding flickering torches are spaced evenly throughout the room, all hooded so as to prevent any melting ice from extinguishing the flames.  A mithril-legged, short wooden desk and a matching chair face a thick imflass door fixed securely into the western wall."
