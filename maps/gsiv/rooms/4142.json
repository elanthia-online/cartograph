    "The entry foyer to this enormous granite crypt is stark, adorned only with grisly friezes sculpted in low relief into the walls.  Bands of bluish-green ahnver are inlaid into the stone in thin strips just below the ceiling throughout the entire structure, bathing the rooms in a subtle light.  A shadowy arch curves overhead and leads deeper into the inner sanctum of the sepulcher."
