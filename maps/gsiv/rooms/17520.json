    "Covered by colorful lichen, the remains of a fieldstone walkway line the path.  Barely visible through the foliage, a passage leads toward a cemetery.  Faint glimmers of will-o'-wisps dance around in the surrounding swamp's forest, though they seem to stay well clear of a massive fallen tree."
