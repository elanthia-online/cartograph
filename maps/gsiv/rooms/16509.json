    "An old fountain is set into the stone wall in the corner of the courtyard, trickles of cool water still running down its eroded stone face to fill the clear pool at its base.  The semicircle of stones that serve as a bench around the fountain and the well-worn flagstones that cover the ground around it give the impression that this was once a public thoroughfare."
