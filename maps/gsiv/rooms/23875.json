  "description": [
    "Seemingly thrown together in haste, the walls of this small hut are lashed together with bits of string and sinew.  Lopsided windows dot two of the walls, while a narrow doorway stands opposite to the entry.  A threadbare carpet of once bright hues covers the packed dirt floor, and a low glass display case sits centered on the fabric.  Overhead, several blown glass orbs illuminate the room with a softly diffused light, giving the space more opulence than it deserves."
