  "description": [
    "On opposite ends of the corridor, covering the windows are wooden shutters carved in lacy patterns that allow a trickle of sunlight into the room.  A gilded mirror hangs above an ebonwood table laden with food and drinks.  Plush flowered carpeting runs the length of the hallway, and colorful, semi-circular doormats occupy the space at the foot of several locked doors."
