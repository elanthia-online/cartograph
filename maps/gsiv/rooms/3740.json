    "Bemused, your eyes wander around this well-occupied lounge.  Happy conversations drift on the air with only an occasional voice rising in heated argument.  A serving maid deftly weaves her way from the bar through the maze of tables arranged in the center of the room, serving platter expertly balanced in her hands.  Among the high-backed booths lining the walls, you see one that appears to be unoccupied.",

    "A high-beamed ceiling rises over walls of wine racks and a live edge mistwood bar with polished lion-head taps.  Opposite the bar, a circle of leather-cushioned swing chairs hang around an oiled table.  A myriad of silver lions holding glowing oil lamps hang between the racks at varying heights and a long sideboard holding an antique racing game stretches along the west wall.  An assortment of drinks on a silver tray rests near a liveried bartender.  Perched on a sturdy crossbeam is a large silver lion."
