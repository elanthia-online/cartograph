    "Gold and crimson stained glass panes glisten from the walls to either side of the office's entrance.  Nearby, a curved teak desk rests in an otherwise spare corner, its expanse raised to look down upon a hard wooden chair set before it.  A series of crimson banners festoons the spotless walls, each banner marked with a different raptor's gold-edged silhouette.  Leaning against the desk is a sheathed sabre bearing a carved ivory hilt."
