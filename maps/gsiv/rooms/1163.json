    "On this side of the river the trees are healthy and vibrant.  On the other side of the river the scene is quite different.  Only a few tree trunks stand, and those are charred and stripped of branches as a result of a passing fire.  Shrubs and berry bushes dominate the area, and in places fast growing cottonwoods thrust up ten feet or so, indicating that the fire probably did not happen in the recent past."
