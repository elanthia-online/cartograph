    "Several cast iron park benches back against a swiftly moving stream along one side of the large, open courtyard.  A cobbled walkway extends through the courtyard's center and continues over a small bridge which spans the moat, connecting the forecourt to the gated entryway of a large fortress.  Opposite the flowing water lies a narrow knot garden with a meadow beyond.",
