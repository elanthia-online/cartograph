  "description": [
    "Various sets of footprints wander through flour that has been spilled on the floor, leading up to a wooden counter.  Behind the counter is a large, footed metal oven that gives off heat and a pleasant scent.  Cabinets hang on the walls holding baking supplies, bowls, cups, and utensils.  In the middle of the room is a crimson cloth-covered table artfully arranged with tarts of various shapes and sizes."
