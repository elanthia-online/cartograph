    "Moonlight filters through the leaves, casting its glow upon two curved benches that provide a place for quiet contemplation.  Cut from black marble and polished to a high gloss, the surface of the benches is worn with use.  Blanketed with clematis, the subtle fragrance of the creamy white flowers fills the air.",
