  "description": [
    "At this distance, the roar of the waterfall is dulled slightly, allowing other sounds of this subterranean world to be heard.  In the darkness above, hidden within the vast, shadowed heights of the enormous cavern, a high-pitched squealing and the minute sounds of tiny claws scraping against stone, have become audible."
