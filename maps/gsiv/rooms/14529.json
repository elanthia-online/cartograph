    "A roughly constructed lean-to offers some shade and a place to rest, veering off to one side of the gravelly path.  A few round-bodied kiwi birds scamper around in the shade, poking at the ground with their long, spindly curving beaks.  They take care to keep out of the way, warily eyeing their surroundings and dashing off at the slightest disturbance."
