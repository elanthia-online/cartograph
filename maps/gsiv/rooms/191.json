    "Stray sunlight gleams off the polished granite buildings as townsfolk wander about on their daily tasks.  Southward above the rooftops, the tip of a lapis-tiled spire can be seen, with a silver and sapphire pennant waving in the breeze.  On this stretch of the var, the roadway seems worn and often used.",
    "Stray moonlight casts a muted, multicolored hue on the granite buildings as a few townsfolk complete their late night tasks along the var.  Southward above the rooftops, the tip of a lapis-tiled spire can be seen, with a silver and sapphire pennant waving in the breeze.  On this stretch of the var, the roadway seems worn and often used.",
    "Southward above the rooftops, the tip of a lapis-tiled spire can be seen, with a silver and sapphire pennant waving in the breeze.  On this stretch of the var, the roadway seems worn and often used, as does the start of a pebbled walkway that branches off the main thoroughfare."
