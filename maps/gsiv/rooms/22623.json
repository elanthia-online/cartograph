    "Swathes of ebony gauze cling to the walls, draped between the black iron sconces and accented with miniature feystone spiders with spindly legs.  Below, tables festooned with violet and black-striped banners cozy up to the walls, and between them stands a tall grey-barked tree laden with a variety of goods.  Here and there among the wares are sculpted silver vases and small tea candles in stained glass holders, the latter illuminating the crimson and lavender fleur-de-lis designs on the shades."
