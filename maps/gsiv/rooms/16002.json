    "Bluegrass lawns and colorful flowerbeds surround an enormous clear water pond, which stretches away from a short wooden fishing dock to a twisted mithril fence that curves in a gentle arc around the garden.  A slender glaes obelisk rises from the center of the pond to tower over the area.  A heavy cedar double door provides entry to the manor's interior, where the sounds of idle conversation and laughter contrast harshly with the garden's quiet and meditative atmosphere."
