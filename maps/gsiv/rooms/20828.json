  "description": [
    "Decorated in relaxing shades of green and gold, everything in this room is scaled to giantman proportions.  The first thing you notice is the large ornate fireplace sending the odor of burning white birch throughout the room.  The plush forest green carpet muffles your footsteps as you walk in and notice the plants growing in all four corners.  A large solid bed rests up against one wall near a solid oak desk."
