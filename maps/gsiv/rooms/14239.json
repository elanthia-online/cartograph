    "A south-climbing white stone staircase ascends into a low portion of the ceiling through an arch studded with cabochon crystals.  Standing guard before the high-rising steps are a pair of blazing brass braziers.  Multi-toned gold carpeting proceeds underfoot, shot through with crown patterns in deep bronze hues."
