    "You stumble over something.  Looking down, your stomach turns as you see the corpse of a person nearly through the stages of decay, although not decayed enough to be unrevolting.  The right arm reaches towards the pass to the southeast, as if crawling in that direction, and the jaw hangs wide in a never-ending silent scream.  You shudder and say a brief prayer for the fallen, but somehow, you wonder if your prayers can be heard.",
