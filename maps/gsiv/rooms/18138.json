  "description": [
    "Well-lit and spacious, the salon is a busy hub of activity.  Elves and visitors to the city go about their business down the various hallways.  An immense ogee arch leads back to the entrance, while along a different wall a guard protects a mistwood door.  Several benches are placed about the area with various topiary set between.  The ceiling is accented with lacy fan vaulting, the pieces overlapping above in a feathered pattern of argent stone."
