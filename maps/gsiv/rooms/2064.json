  "description": [
    "A road once meandered along the river.  Unfortunately the river has done some meandering of its own, with the result that not much is left of the road.  Here and there bits of the road remain, but the rest is little more than a flat sandy expanse beside the river, fine for walking, but useless for wagons and other civilized traffic."
