  "description": [
    "Golden filigree leaves spiral up the columns of the quaint shop and reach for the domed ceiling which is painted with a view of the night sky.  Silver constellations wink as the lamp light reflects off of them, while tiny chimes dangling from the peak create a melodic tune that is soothing and pleasant.  Several shelves are lined with cards and matching envelopes, while a small table near a white birch door houses boxes and ribbons."
