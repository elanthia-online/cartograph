  "description": [
    "A short, latticework iron fence encloses the patio, entwined with several rose bushes and jasmine vines that grow along its length.  The perfume of the flowers dance through the air, mingling with the salty scent of the nearby bay.  A few tables and cushioned chairs are scattered throughout the patio in little groups, offering room for many patrons to have pleasant conversation and respite."
