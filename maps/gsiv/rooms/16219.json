    "Centrally located in the room is a small brick oven.  Beside the oven is a wooden rack holding various iron and steel implements.  To one side is a sturdy wooden table.  Firmly set at regular intervals into the thick stucco walls of the room are four sets of manacles.  The room is lighted by a few ceramic oil lamps hanging from the low ceiling."
