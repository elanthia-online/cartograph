    "Great care has been taken to lending this prim tent every accroutement of a standing boutique.  A plush argent rug rests over sturdy floorboards, while gilded candelabras stand at a protective distance from the tent's taut silk walls, basking the space in a pleasant golden candlelight.  An oaken display table dominates this area of the tent, its surface artfully carved and painted to resemble the streets and structures of Ta'Illistim."
