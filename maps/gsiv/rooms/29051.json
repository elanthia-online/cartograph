  "description": [
    "Thickly canopied, the animal track slips between tall conifers and tangles of clinging, thorny vines.  Shadows dance through the area, their lively gesticulations matching the subtle breezes and sway of leaves.  Widening slightly to the northeast, the narrow dirt trail is littered with dried seedpods and dandelion puffs."
