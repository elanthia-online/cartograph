    "Upon the columns and arches of the cloister, ivy twists about the pale green vines of day-blooming morning glory and the darker vines holding translucent moonflowers of the palest pinks and lavenders.  Starlight illuminates mosaic flooring depicting simply robed men and women planting and gathering a multitude of flora.",
    "Ivy clambers up limestone columns of the cloister, intermixing with the darker, night-blooming vines of the moonflowers and the cheerfully bright morning glory blossoms.  Mosaic flooring depicts simply robed men and women planting and gathering a multitude of flora."
