    "Decorated with little fanfare, this small room holds two round wooden tables and a handful of carved oak chairs.  A wide bookcase is guarded on both sides by two stuffed otter statues, and a few steel-incased lanterns for ample light when needed.  A large, tawny brindlecat hide rug is sprawled across the floor."
