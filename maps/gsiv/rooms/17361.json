    "The confluence of warm and cool air from the row of steam rooms to the east and frigidaria to the west leaves the white tile floor slick with condensation.  Beautifully rendered mosaics wrap around the walls, depicting figures engaged in a half-dozen different styles of hand-to-hand combat ranging from giantkin wrestling to the intricate dancelike steps of the southern elves."
