    "A small hole in the ceiling provides access to the roof, but the main purpose of this room is for rest and comfort.  Row after row of beds in descending order of length and width fills the room, leaving only a small space near the stairs for an herb and bandage cabinet.  Adorning one wall is a large banner that simply reads, \"Honor.\""
