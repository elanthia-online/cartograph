    "The trees draw closer to the path.  Their trunks create a repeating pattern of rugged bark, peeling and cracked in irregular plates and at close look, beautiful in the subtlety of color.  A movement up in the dark green wilderness of needles reveals a chickadee.  The bird flits silently through the branches, bright chirps smothered by the silence inhabiting the path.",

A movement up in the dark wilderness of needles reveals a nighthawk.  The bird flits silently through the branches, bright chirps smothered by the silence inhabiting the path."
