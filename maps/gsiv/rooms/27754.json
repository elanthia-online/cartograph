    "At one time a doctor's office, the room is in a state of chaotic disarray save for an obsessively organized oak desk centered in the room.  The desk is flanked on opposite walls by a lopsided corkboard and wide bay windows so caked in filth that moonlight barely penetrates them.  A tall slanted bookshelf spans another wall, its staggered shelves displaying various oddities.  The floor is covered in deliberately carved markings, concentrated near an oddly upholstered couch.  Hanging overhead is a swirling black void spanning the ceiling.",
