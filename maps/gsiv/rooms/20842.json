  "description": [
    "A slab of black marble forms the base for a tall black fireplace, and a golden mantle stands opposite a large leather couch.  In the center, a long table covered with maps is encircled by several leather chairs.  Behind the table, a heavy hatch leads into the Dreadnaught vault.  Tall, open doors lead to a balcony.  Mounted on a railing is a spyglass aimed to survey the surrounding area, while an oversized telescope is pointed towards the stars."
