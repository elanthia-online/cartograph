    "A row of drab buildings borders the eastern side of the street, the grey faces staring, expressionless, across the way into a line of thin trees straggling along the town wall.  Pushed by a slight-but-steady breeze, pieces of twig chatter along the cobbles, as if in answer to the low whisper rustling incessantly through the leaves.  A line of grimy dwarves in miner's gear tramps south, each one glancing at you as he passes."
