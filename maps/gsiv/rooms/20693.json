  "description": [
    "This cavern forms a spacious room with a flat floor.  Two wide-gated, opposing tunnels to the north and south, lead off to unknown locales.  Wheel ruts in the floor indicate that wagons once moved through the tunnels.  The tracks also lead to the west through a tunnel from whence the sound of rushing water emanates.  A curved stone bench hugs the wall between the tunnels, flanked by two potted toadstools.  A glass-paned window offers a view of a collection of gems displayed in a small niche in the eastern wall."
