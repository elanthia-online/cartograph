    "The coiled passageway culminates in a vast chamber, its farthest corners hidden in darkness and clouds of dust.  Flickers of static electricity light the clouds from within, sending arcane reflections arcing across the towering walls.  Overhead, a monstrous ring of stone hangs in the center of the chamber, its source of support invisible.  It hovers over a matching ring carved into the rock floor."
