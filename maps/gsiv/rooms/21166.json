  "description": [
    "Low ceilings fashioned of blocky cobblestones meet with the smooth stone walls, which are supported by a soft floor of dry dirt.  Tiny rivulets, fed by condensation upon the eastern walls, follow the tunnel to the north under the watchful gaze of some ring-bound torches.  A thick metal grate separates this section of the sewers from the others."
