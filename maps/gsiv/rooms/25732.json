    "Smooth ironwood planking juts from the shoreline to form this sturdy dock; hand carved pickets of roble runs its length, fitted with a seamless railing.  Extending down the center is a wide walkway of alternating blue and gold mosaic tiles, each handset into shallow grooves within the planking.  Set in slightly raised reliefs among the tiles are a series of musical notes, each elegantly carved from dark ebonwood.  Coats of clear varnish wrap both the dock and railing in a weathertight protective finish."
