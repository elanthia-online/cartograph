    "A lone sentinel wrought of glossy white marble stands before the invar portcullis, with stoic eyes fixed on the path ahead.  Suspended above the stone figure is a large banner stitched in silver.  Giant luminescent toadstools form a half-circle around the entrance, shedding their soft, bluish-white light upon the reflective stone walls.  An enruned archway partitions the entrance from the rest of the edifice to the northwest."
