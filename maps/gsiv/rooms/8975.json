    "The snow and ice which dominate Icemule Trace stop abruptly at the fenceline of the park.  In their place sits a wide open greensward full of laughing children running everywhere.  A strange glow hangs about the area, an odd magical field, slightly shimmering, its outer edge falling right at the snowline.  A tall statue comprised of ten wizened halflings in enruned robes stands majestically at the center of the field."
