  "description": [
    "A low ceiling and an assortment of overstuffed chairs scattered throughout the room give the lounge an intimate ambiance.  An ornate Faendryl crest hangs above the massive black marble fireplace that dominates one end of the room.  Opposite the fireplace is a dart board fancifully painted with ravens and griffins.  A gleaming ebonwood bar accented with rhimar spans the length of the room, an open humidor left forgotten at one end."
