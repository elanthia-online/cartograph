  "description": [
    "The melodic sound of the falls is easily heard from this location, the insurgence of water causing the lagoon to ripple with the ebb and flow of the current against the edges of the shore.  The constant dampness infused into the air from the water leaves the thick carpet of moss and plants glistening with dew, while the various flowers sparkle with reflected moonlight upon their own damp surfaces."
