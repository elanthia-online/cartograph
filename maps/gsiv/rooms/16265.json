  "description": [
    "Although the jungle has inexorably overgrown this small area, it is still possible to discern it was once a formal garden.  A fountain stands to one side, the water in the basin filthy and stagnant.  The thorny runners of rose bushes have pulled down a rusted metal trellis.  A grey marble bench has been tipped over and damaged by some heavy object."
