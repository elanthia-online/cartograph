  "description": [
    "The curving wagon walls have been painted a pale sage green, while overhead, dozens of tiny pastel candles flicker on a shelf along the soffit.  Next to the entrance, a quaint hand-written sign hangs over a small round table, and a stone wishing well stands in the center upon a daisy-shaped rug.  A knotted tree branch arches over the steps leading to the back garden."
