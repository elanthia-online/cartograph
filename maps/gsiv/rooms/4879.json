    "The scree at the base of the cliff is inhospitable to larger trees, but hosts a variety of small shrubs and grasses as well as providing welcome shade to a pair of vividly colored lizards.  The cliff face is utterly featureless above the first few feet, almost as though the rock had been fused to a glassy smoothness by some unimaginable heat.",
    "The scree at the base of the cliff is inhospitable to the larger trees, but hosts a variety of smaller shrubs and grasses.  The sheer rock wall to the north blots out the stars, and bright moonlight reveals that after the first few feet, the cliff is as smooth as if it had been fused by some unimaginable heat."
