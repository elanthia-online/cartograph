    "A fire burns within a stone hearth, adding an aromatic haze to the area.  Several old chairs form a semicircle around the fireplace, with a small table nestled in-between, forming a quaint gathering area.  Off to the side, a velvet-lined display case's contents are evenly spaced and elevated on an incline to enhance their presentation.  A small placard has been perched on the top of the case."
