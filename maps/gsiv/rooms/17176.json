    "Tapestries of rich hues of blue dominate the walls of the room, creating an illusion of a waterfall as they drape to the floor.  A sea of cushions in shades of cerulean and azure are piled high before a lapis lazuli fireplace lit with a warming fire.  A collection of seashells lines the mantle, some grains of sand still clinging to them.  A menagerie of carved sapphire animals prance along one of the window sills, catching the light."
