    "A lone wooden dock sways and creaks, awaiting a ferryboat traveling the short distance to the mine tunnel.  Upstream, the river widens as it begins its journey to the sea, the color of the water shifting to a lighter hue.  At the northeast end of the riverfront, a small street leads away from the dock and back towards town."
