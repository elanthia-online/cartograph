    "An upheaval deep within the earth has rent the mountainside to form a gaping gorge along the western slope.  Billows of swirling fog rise from the depths of the gorge shielding what lies within it from view.  A decaying log of considerable size is lodged against the sharp rocks near the edge of the precipice."
