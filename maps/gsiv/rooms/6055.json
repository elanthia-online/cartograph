    "Though the wind blowing across the corn field is cool and somewhat dry, the moisture rising from the wet ground in between the rows creates pockets of still, clammy air.  Droplets of condensation cling to skin, clothing, armor, and most anything on which they can collect.  Then they combine with other droplets, running in sticky rivulets in between skin and clothing to drip back again on the damp soil underfoot."
