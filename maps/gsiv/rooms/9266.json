  "description": [
    "Lit by plain iron lanterns, the unfinished modwir boards of the teller's counter, rough-sawn planks of the floor, bare log walls and drab garb of the dour dwarven teller make it obvious that no extra expense or effort has been spent here to dress the place up.  Nothing more has been done than was needed to provide a secure place for the exchange of silvers."
