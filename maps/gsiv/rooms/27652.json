    "Dark panelling covers the walls in this small and dimly lit space.  Two grimy, rectangular windows are nestled in the middle of the outside wall, neither clean enough to let in any appreciable light.  A walnut chest with broken hinges lies beneath one of the windows, while a shipping crate, its lid removed, lies beneath the other."
