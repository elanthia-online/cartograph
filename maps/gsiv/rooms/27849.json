    "Luxurious panels of grey and white flyrsilk completely line the walls of this small sanctuary.  A massive scythe-shaped chandelier hangs directly over a statue of Gosaena that is positioned in the center of the room.  Feathered white candles adorn the perimeter of the chandelier, casting a soft glow throughout the room.  A small grey altar painted with a white feather is carefully placed just in front of the statue.  A padded white flyrsilk prayer rug sits at the altar."
