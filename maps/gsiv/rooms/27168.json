    "Thin sheets of plywood stretch between the thick hickory support posts of the walls and are anchored in place by large wrought iron nails.  Half-melted candles rests at the four corners of a large oak table that occupies the center of the room, their flickering light providing just enough illumination by which to view the maps that are on display."
