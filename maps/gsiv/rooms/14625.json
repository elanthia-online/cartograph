    "Polished to a sheen, the dark slate veranda is surrounded by black lacquered, plowed handrails inlaid with elegant gold scrollwork.  Strategically placed, oil-filled lanterns are hung to provide comfortable lighting in the evenings yet remain unobtrusive during the day.  A series of silvery mithril posts extend from the handrails to a crosshatched cedar overhang extending from the roof above.  Between the center posts, a rusted invar telescope aims southwest, partially blocking the view of the courtyard below."
