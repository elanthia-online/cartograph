    "The lamp on the wall behind you casts your shadow onto the rough wood surface of the table.  A bit of washcloth is stuck to a large splinter sticking straight out from the table's edge, promising a nasty cut should you accidentally lean into it.  The fading thrak on the surface of the table is so fat, the image can be seen on either side of your shadow."
