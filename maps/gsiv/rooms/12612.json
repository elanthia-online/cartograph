    "One entire wall of this circular chamber is made of thin clear glass, and through it you can see the fiery cauldron of Luukos' Gullet far below.  A large multi-faceted crystal orb lies cradled in a marble stand directly in front of the window, and a long black marble altar stands next to the orb.  From far away, you can hear the sounds of chaotic chimes ringing discordantly."
