    "The road runs straight and true.  As you look in either direction, the cobblestones make a perfect compass line south and north, marred in places where the path has crumbled away, but always resuming in perfect precision.  Only a \"road\" now by a generous conceit, the stones still speak of the skill of the mason whose children's children surely died long before you were born."
