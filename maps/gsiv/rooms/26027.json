    "Two female statues flank a simple limestone altar.  One hangs suspended upside down, her feet gracefully pointed toward the sky and her arms outstretched in a gesture curiously evocative of both embrace and denial.  The other, a fair but expressionless winged woman, gazes at nothing as though she were beyond either hope or concern.  A broken mirror behind the altar throws back the sunlight from arched windows in shards."
