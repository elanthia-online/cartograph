  "description": [
    "The light from the crystals to the east easily illuminate this cavernous corridor, displaying the roughly hewn walls of stone and a large boulder seemingly pushed up against the southern wall.  A small trickle of water from the stream to the east moves to the west, hinting at the subtle sloping of this corridor."
