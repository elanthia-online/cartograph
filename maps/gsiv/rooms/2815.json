    "The silence of the pines is gently broken by snatches of bird song and an occasional rustle in the underbrush.  A thin sound of wind whistling through branches adds to the chorale, the gusts heavily laden with the rich loamy scent of the forest.  The path curves around a thick growth of rhododendron that edges the trail on its western shoulder.",
