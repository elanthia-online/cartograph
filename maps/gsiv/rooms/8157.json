  "description": [
    "Perched on the ample shoulder of the hill, the trail skirts the incline, passing between cottages blessed with an expansive view of Hummingbird Pond as well as an impressive expanse of the surrounding countryside.  Further up, a collection of bee hives is visible, and beyond, the forest reclaims the hillside."
