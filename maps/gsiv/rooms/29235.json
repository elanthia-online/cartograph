  "description": [
    "Heavily trampled dirt makes for a dry and dusty road running between Widowmaker's Road and the depths of the forest beyond.  The shed antlers of several large stags are bleached white with age, and a massive skull of ursian origin rests half-buried beneath a fallen oak.  The lilt of songbirds lend a chorus to the caws of ravens overhead."
