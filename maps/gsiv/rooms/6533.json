    "As the old thoroughfare travels toward the castle, the prairie grass begins to thin and wither away.  The fortress is a huge, rambling edifice, thrusting up from the cold lake-water lapping at its feet.  The shores of the lake known as Lough Ne'halin stretch away to the northwest, bounded by stark cliffs, and in the distance there, a thin tower sticks up out of the gloomy fog like a skeletal finger."
