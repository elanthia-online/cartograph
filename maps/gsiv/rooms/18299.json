  "description": [
    "Long strings of seaweed have washed up on the shore, creating an olive-hued curtain ranging the length of this section of coastline.  Riding the ocean swells, a large forest of giant kelp floats along the surface, the obvious source of the beach's marine decoration.  Nighttime shadows encase the kelp beds, further enhancing the ethereal appearance of the moonlight reflecting from the surface of the rolling surf.  To the northeast and southeast dense foliage heralds the island's jungle interior."
