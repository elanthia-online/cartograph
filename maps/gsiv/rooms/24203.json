  "description": [
    "A white-striped black canvas awning, supported by a pair of thin steel poles, stretches from the roof of the wagon, casting the thick muddy ground in deep shadow.  Several wooden crates are stacked to one side of a small wooden hatch.  At the edge of the yard stands a tiny portable forge with an iron anvil and a low worktable nearby."
