  "description": [
    "The thick tree coverage runs up to the edge of a steep cliff and provides welcome shelter from the harsh wind. Without those frigid gusts howling through the tree branches, the forest is remarkably peaceful. Several sets of tracks wind chaotically through the forest, and a few disappear up a fairly steep incline."
