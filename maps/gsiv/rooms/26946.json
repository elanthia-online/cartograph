    "Moonlight reflects off of the cobalt blue tiles of the garden pathway, its soft and luminous light lending the incredibly smooth, glass-like travertine walls of the Needle of Pentas a frosted appearance.  An arched awning of haon and glass provides the rounded entry with protection from the elements, while small white statues cupping brightly glowing orbs in their hands line the pathway.  Bushes of indigo butterflyweed occupy every bit of untiled ground and house tiny bowls of nectar in their depths."
