    "The base of this square tower is patrolled by a halfling militia guard.  The stone floors are empty but for a few wooden chairs and a wooden trash barrel, and the woolen wall hangings provide more quiet and warmth than cheer.  A narrow staircase bends along the walls as it rises into the heights above."
