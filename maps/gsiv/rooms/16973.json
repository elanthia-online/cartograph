  "description": [
    "A massive onrush of flowing water falls from far above, the raging torrent of white-swirled blueness crashing upon a triad of large marble raindrops.  Shimmering waves of mist rise from the base of the waterfall, dancing in and out of the shards of light reflected by the crystalline walls.  The roar of the falls is nearly deafening, and ribbons of cerulean light wash over the glossy floor and ceiling."
