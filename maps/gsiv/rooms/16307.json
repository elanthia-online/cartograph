    "A broad mahogany desk occupies the center of the elegantly furnished marble chamber.  Scrolls are stacked in neat piles upon the desk and arrayed in an orderly fashion on the shelves.  By the silk-curtained window, there stands a potted palm its leaves rustling softly in response to the soft breeze flowing off the sea.",
