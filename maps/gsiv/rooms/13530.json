    "A multihued Vornavian silk tapestry hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a dark and light oak ceiling rises overhead.  A woven Vornavian silk rug sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is an invitingly soft cluster of dark velvet throw pillows surrounding a low felwood table on one side of the shop and a set of carved felwood shelves on the other."
