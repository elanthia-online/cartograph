    "A colorful ocean scene wallpaper draws the eye up to the bright walls and seashell-adorned ceiling of the shop.  Strung across the room from west wall to east wall are thick-braided sea grass ropes, knotted at each end to a rusted grappling hook.  Laid across the expanses of the ropes is an array of large colorful rugs and mats, each woven into a different design.  From the speckled sea glass ceiling hang smaller rugs cut into whimsical shapes and creatures."
