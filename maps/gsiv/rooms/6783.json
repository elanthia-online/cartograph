    "Modwirs and pines hem in on the edge of the meadow, forming a small cul-de-sac.  A large storm cloud hangs ominously in the grey sky over the majestic mountain above, flashing and rumbling as it drapes over the peak.  The black cloud suddenly flashes and a great bolt of lightning crashes down on the mountaintop.  Moments later the low rumble of thunder rolls over the vale."
