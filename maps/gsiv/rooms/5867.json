    "Here atop the hillock, you see the original section of the cemetery spreading out before you to the north.  Even from this distance it is obvious that the plots around the perimeter of the cemetery are much newer.  To the south you can see the gates marking the entrance to the cemetery.  The iron fence that encloses the cemetery is easy to identify, even where the local flora tries to obscure it.",
    "Here atop the hillock, moonlight illuminates the original section of the cemetery spreading out before you to the north.  To south you can just make out the gates marking the entrance to the cemetery.  The iron fence that encloses the cemetery is obscured as it blends with the darkness of the night."
