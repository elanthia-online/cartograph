    "Cool air surrounds you, permeating your being.  Candles on a seven-sided altar provide the only light in this dim room.  Shadows cast by the flickering candlelight shift in a macabre dance over the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lining the walls.  Papers and opened tomes are strewn on a desk in organized disarray."
