    "Three beams of moonlight descend from tall narrow windows set into the midpoint of a polished granite wall and illuminate a dark wood workbench placed in the center of the room.  The faint sound of flowing water fills the room from the direction of the windows and is accompanied by the sound of wind tugging on unseen leaves and branches.  A small altar rests in a niche in one corner."
