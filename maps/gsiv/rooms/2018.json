    "A huge boulder sits next to the trail, towering overhead in the moonlight like a hulking giant watching any who traverses the path.  Its granite composition is foreign to the surrounding basalt, as though the stone was dropped here by something so monumental that hefting such a boulder would pose no difficulty.  Beneath its considerable overhang, the darkness is dense and visibility, nonexistent.",
