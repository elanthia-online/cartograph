    "Dry, slightly stagnant air fills this broad structure, its arid scent tinged with odors of resin and wood polish.  Well-organized shelves have been affixed to the birch-paneled walls, their heavily varnished surfaces holding the various goods for sale in this establishment.  Decorative brass lanterns illuminate the room, their unwavering glow shedding an amber light across the wooden floor and rows of shelving.",
    "The air has an acrid odor, and the shelves and counter are darkened from both smoke and water damage.  The brass lanterns continue to shine brightly, though their panes have all been hopelessly shattered.",
    "The broad room is well-lit and meticulously clean.  Row upon row of shelves displaying a multitude of goods fill the back part of the room, and a polished oak counter stands near the door, upon which sits a a sturdy scale, a black-inked sign, and a mist-filled silver bowl.  Brass lanterns are mounted on the walls, casting a warm glow over the wood-paneled walls and floor and driving the shadows out from between the shelves."
