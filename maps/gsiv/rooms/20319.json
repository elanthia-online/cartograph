    "A huge collection of charms and fetishes dangles from the bald cypress branches overhanging this spot.  Pale mist covers the shoreline, disappearing abruptly at the water's edge.  Lily pads cover the surface, their petals overlapping each other, their blossoms a pale purple color that is especially vivid in the dank surroundings."
