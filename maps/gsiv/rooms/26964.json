    "Fashioned of haon, an arched tunnel trellis creates a connective corridor between the northern and southern ends of the garden.  Cobalt blue tiles surrounded by a thick, golden moss fill the pathway, while tiny statues fashioned of marble hold brightly glowing orbs aloft in their intricately carved hands.  Bands of amethyst, indigo, and niveous wisteria blossoms dangle between the slats like floral icicles that release their gentle, sweet fragrance in the air."
