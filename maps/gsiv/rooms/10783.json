    "The bend in the treetops is somewhat more pronounced as the wind picks up.  All of them have a definite lean to the southwest, indicating the prevailing direction of the breeze.  Closer to the ground the wind is still brisk, however, scuttling needles, small branches and other forest debris across the woodland floor.  Much of the debris gathers into small piles against the northeast sides of the trees, leaving rather clean areas on the other sides."
