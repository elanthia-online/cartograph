    "Glass-doored cabinets occupy the outer edge of this subterranean room, and their procession is interrupted only by the occasional oil lamp mounted to the stone walls between.  Within the cabinets, there are countless glass-stoppered bottles filled with all manner of things, as well as other implements such as mortar and pestle, a silver athame, and other sundry items.  A tall narrow stand fitted with some shelves sits beneath one of the lamps and is draped in onyx-hued velvet with a fringe of bloodjewel beading."
