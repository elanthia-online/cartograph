    "Slightly crowded, the shop is filled with armor-adorned mannequins that display the various wares sold here.  A short, low counter bisects the shop at the back, while a series of wide windows, each wrapped in silk, occupy two of the four walls and allow the island's breezes to cool the otherwise warm room."
