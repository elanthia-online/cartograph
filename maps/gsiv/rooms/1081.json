    "The trail continues to follow the edge of the plateau to the northwest and south, skirting very close to the edge to avoid large crevices that race out of the interior only to turn and zigzag back into the endless wasteland.  The plateau's interior almost looks as if someone molded the entire area out of soft clay, scraped it flat, then sent lightning randomly coursing through to make the crevices before it all hardened in place."
