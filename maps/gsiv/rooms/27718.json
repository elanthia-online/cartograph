    "[East Barbican, North Tower]"

  "description": [
    "A circle of windows looks out onto the surrounding landscape from the top of the tower, each offering as its view only a thin slice of the world as its view because of the arched, slit-like construction.  A few stick-like markings mar the otherwise smooth stone surface beneath the windows -- the arcane figures likely the handiwork of some rather bored guardsman.  A long, thick rope has been tied to a grommet beneath the widest of the windows, permitting access to the eastern wall below."
