    "Here on the highest level of the building, most of the walls and the roof seem to be formed of a clear glasslike crystal that allows an almost unrestricted view of the sky above and the surrounding townscape.  Various instruments of observation and study stand on a raised platform in the middle of the room.  To the south is a hallway."
