  "description": [
    "Rushes are strewn across the floor of this enormous room with a lofty ceiling, and elaborate tapestries adorn the walls.  Opposite the entrance is a raised dais dominated by a massive table overlooking scores of smaller tables.  In the center of the Hall lies a large hearth providing warmth and light, and a few comfortable leather chairs are scattered about.  A display case rests against the east wall, flanked by trophies of conquered beasts.  Stairs lead up the north wall to a railed balcony."
