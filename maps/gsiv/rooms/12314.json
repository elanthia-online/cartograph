    "Wrapped by spindled banisters, the porch is crafted of golden linden and preserved beneath a varnish of clear lacquer.  A painted wooden sign sways slightly in the breeze and casts shadows upon a pair of low wooden steps, which spill out into a pathway of crushed seashells.  Warm sunlight reflects off of the painted glass windows of the double-wide doors that lead into the inn.",
