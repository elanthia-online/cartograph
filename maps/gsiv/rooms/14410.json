    "An openwork iron staircase rises up in a sharp spiral, ascending the levels of this small turret.  The outer wall has been painted a dark hue that contains a mottled shading of black with touches of indigo, more like a violent storm than the pinnacle of midnight.  Towards the ceiling it fades to a dusky grey."
