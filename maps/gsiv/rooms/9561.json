    "A reddish glow washes over the rocky walls and stalactites, emanating from a fissure that bisects the cavern from north to south.  High above the river of molten rock, a pair of sturdy glaes bridges adjoins the two sides of the cavern.  Several of the larger stalagmites situated in a rough circle have been carved into monoliths bearing giant engraved runes of the elements."
