    "Against the outer wall, the blackened silhouette of stairs leading up to the ramparts is all that remains of the access to the top of the wall.  Charcoal and half-burned lumber litter the ground at the base of the wall.  In one blackened plank a dozen iron arrowheads still remain as witness to the ferocity of a battle once fought here."
