  "description": [
    "Nestled between a stand of fir trees, water flows through breaks in the ice of the partially frozen brook of water, which runs alongside the two-story building.  Loganberry clings heartily to the entire north side of the edifice, and its over-ripened fruit litters the surrounding ground.  Standing beneath the window of the tavern, a wood carved rolton is positioned to give the illusion of the statue eating berries from a shrub."
