  "description": [
    "Thick and viscous, the mist strangles the area with its dank tendrils and its blanketing dampness.  Water drips from several bands of paddle weed that are imbedded in the cobbles of the path, their green leaves glimpsed briefly as the gloom sporadically parts to emit the moonlight from above.   Dark shadows play upon the crumbled remains of a crumbled flagstone tower in the distance, while a ragged shale outcropping is surrounded by echoing winds and voluminous darkness.",
    "Ragged outcroppings of shale and flagstone swallow a wrought iron railing that encircles the pathway, their ragged protrusions blocking the view of the distant ocean and scenery.  Twining bands of paddle weed spread their dark green leaves through the area, their hairy roots clutching at the cobblestones to soak up any spare moisture they can find.  The crumbled remains of a tower, its base buried in the stone, rises roofless into the distance and creates darker shadows upon the mountain slag."
