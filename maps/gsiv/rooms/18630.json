  "description": [
    "A shallow alcove of stone to the northwest harbors a statue of a gaunt man with heavy-lidded eyes, his hand resting upon the hilt of a longsword.  A black altar stands before the statue, an open tome resting upon its immaculately smooth surface.  Throughout the ceiling, glistening white shells have been inlaid into the rock, causing them to twinkle like stars as the candles placed throughout the room flicker softly."
