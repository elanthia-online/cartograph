    "The rise of the intense heat caused the ceiling to cool last, resulting in gigantic stalactites and stalagmites to form as the slowly running fluid of rock from the ceiling dripped from above.  Some of the drips never made it to the cavern floor, and they look like huge mushrooms turned upside down suspended from the ceiling, the rock cooling as it trickled down the stem and forming the bulb, which thickened with each new layer."
