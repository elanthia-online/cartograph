    "Traipsing across a bubbling brook is an arched footbridge painted a soft white that matches the pebbles of the meandering pathway that leads to a cluster of glossy-leafed holly trees.  Thick green moss creates an alluring carpet around the base of an ancient tanik that is surrounded by a complex platform system.  Wide steps separate the ground level from the first platform, which is obscured from sight by vibrantly colored silk banners."
