    "[Cavorting Thrak Table]"

  "description": [
    "Centered on the central plank of the table is a glass full of water, set upside down on a small plate.  There are grooves in the floor boards, where the heavy wooden chairs have been dragged back and forth through the years over the same places.  Marching around the edge of the table are tiny paintings of dozens of thraks in a madcap parade."
