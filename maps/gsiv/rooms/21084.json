    "Tangled vines spill out of the jungle and past the bright white stones that create the border between the dense jungle and the moss-covered clearing.  Ruffled pink passionflowers mingle with gold yellow passionfruits along the lower edges of the cord-like vine, while broad leaves decorate the higher sections that cling to the nearby trees."
