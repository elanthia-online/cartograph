    "Sunlight dapples the sweeping foredeck of the riverboat.  Mahogany decking lined with brass railings has been inlaid with a giant rosewood albatross and is large enough for dancing or even for a pavilion to be erected on its expanse.  An open arch leads into main cabin, and the deck wraps about it to the starboard and port."
