    "An amazing tangle of dried out shrubs and thorn-covered hedges are forcing the path to fork off in two directions.  The decaying remains of a small rodent are still visible within the spiky brush, the unfortunate animal clearly a victim of one of the sharp spines.  Above the path, a massive tower pierces the sky."
