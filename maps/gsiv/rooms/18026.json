    "A large dog wanders around the front yard of one of the houses, returning often to its small igloo home to get out of the fierce weather.  The yard itself bears the brunt of the animal's attempts to run free, many large holes pockmarking the otherwise well-kept grounds.  Even the white fence marking the property line is heavily scratched up from the rampant digging."
