    "Surrounded by tangled vines and leafy ferns, a small stall occupies the clearing, its smooth expanse covered with a pyramid of murky white glass milk bottles.  A mustachioed huckster paces between the stall and a pile of brick-colored balls, which has been arranged upon the ground near the planks that lead to the main concourse."
