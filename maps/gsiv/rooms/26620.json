    "The inside of the outhouse is a generally cramped and odorous affair.  The elevated seat occupies a majority of the lower interior and bears a wooden lid to cover the opening to the pit latrine below.  The gaps between and cracks in the driftwood plank walls admit some flickering torchlight, with pale moonlight filtering through the cut-out crescent shapes above the door.",
