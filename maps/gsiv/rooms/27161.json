    "Holding court amid both fresh and moldy rushes, a large throne-like chair fitted with a bright purple cushion sits at an angle to the room's far corner.  Smaller benches and stools pay homage to the monstrosity, which is gaudily decorated with copper asps.  Near to the entry, someone has taken a bench and nailed it to the top of another one to create a kind of high table where various drinks and food are displayed."
