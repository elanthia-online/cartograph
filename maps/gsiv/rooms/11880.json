    "A side tunnel basically extends nowhere here.  Perhaps it was slated to be a future aqueduct to another part of the city, or just to provide a well for something overhead that ended up not needing a well.  The reason is lost in history, and the unmoving, emerald water provides no clue.  The eastern wall has crumbled away, though, to reveal a high breach.  The sound of rapidly flowing water comes from the other side of the breach."
