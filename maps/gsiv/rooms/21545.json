    "While still decorated in a colorful motif, this room has been toned down a bit in comparison to the main shop room.  The room has lots of open space for play.  A slate board is mounted on one wall, covered in chalk drawings in a childish style.  Several cushioned mats in a variety of colors are scattered on the floor to sit upon, and a slightly smudged window lets a bit of diffused light enter the room.  A tall mirror with a bright purple frame leans precariously near a faded tacked-up curtain.",
