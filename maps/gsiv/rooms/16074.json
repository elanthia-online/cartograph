    "Gold-veined marble walls rise from an ornate ceramic tile floor.  Just above a wyvern painted ivory vase hangs an intricate knot-worked wall-hanging, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A gold-veined black marble counter and a floral-etched ceramic case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
