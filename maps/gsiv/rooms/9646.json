    "Water from a recent rain trickles from the eaves of the colonnaded hall to your northeast and splashes against the greenery below.  Carp in a nearby pond snap greedily at flying insects unfortunate enough to land on the rushes near the water's edge, their movements sending scatters of reflected moonlight dancing from the surface of the pond."
