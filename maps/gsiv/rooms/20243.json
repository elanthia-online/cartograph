  "description": [
    "Jagged rocks line the western edge of the pathway that winds its way through the swamp, while the eastern track slips away into the scum-covered watercourse.  Towering trees block the sky, offering very little light to penetrate through the flora.  Skeins of half-rotted vines drape in uneven lengths from the decaying monstrosities and are coated with slime."
