    "The stone walls that enclose this pit are bare save the inordinate amount of gore that clings to the rough-hewn stone, and the stench of rot and decay are so pervasive that breathing is a difficulty.  Underfoot, instead of stone, there are bodily remains, too numerous to count and in such a state as to defy ready identification.  All are in varying stages of decomposition, from bare bones scarred by obvious cut marks to nearly fresh corpses, bloated and distended with putrefaction.  Ankle-deep water covers the floor."
