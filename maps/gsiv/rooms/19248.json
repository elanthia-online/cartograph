    "Finished in crisp white monir paneling trimmed with mistwood, the walls of this chamber are set with a series of open doorways.  Miniature trees and petite flowering shrubs fill large red clay pots that are spaced evenly around the room.  Tall candles in golden sconces illuminate the area, casting long shifting shadows on the numerous plants below."
