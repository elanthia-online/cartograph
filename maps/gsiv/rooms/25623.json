  "description": [
    "The water here is a pleasant dichotomy of quiet stillness and swirling agitation as a row of rocks dams the majority of the river's flow.  A few surging rivulets manage to break free, streaming in to fill this kidney-shaped depression.  A stone shelf beneath the rocky barrier allows those who perch there to experience leisurely water-massages."
