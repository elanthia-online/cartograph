  "description": [
    "This tower commands a view of the South Gate trail, but few if any pass through its shadowy maw.  To the north and east, the city of Icemule Trace is lit by the warmth of candle and hearth fire, but surrounded by the cold darkness of the city walls.  From somewhere below the tower comes the rhythmical pulse of the windmill blades as they turn in time with the ubiquitous glacial winds.",
    "This tower commands a view of the trail as it leaves the South Gate, passes the Behlayr and Ice Forest neighborhoods, and then heads toward Wehnimer's Landing.  To the north and east, the tower provides an excellent view of the city walls and of the city of Icemule Trace.  Directly below the tower, the blades of the windmill turn in lazy rhythm in time with the ubiquitous glacial winds."
