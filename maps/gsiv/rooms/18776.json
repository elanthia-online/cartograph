    "Blue-washed sandstone forms the walls of the small library, and the aroma and taste of botanical herbs is heavy in the air.  Matching bookcases line the far wall, each filled to overflowing with a variety of tomes, scrolls, and manuscripts.  Some plush-cushioned oak chairs have been placed centrally in the room atop an oval-shaped pale rose carpet, and a multi-tiered stand rests beneath a window, its shelves laden with potted herbs and plants of many varieties."
