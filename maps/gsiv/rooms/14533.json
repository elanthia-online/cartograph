  "description": [
    "A network of shallow streams converge in three places here, each join spilling down over large angular rocks.  A small wooden bridge arcs over a wide space in the resulting river, its high handrails the perch of many small birds passing through.  Hanging over the structure is a single palm tree with a thick, scaly brown trunk, its web-like fronds dropping onto the planks."
