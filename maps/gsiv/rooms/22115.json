  "description": [
    "Resting between a pair of miniature orange trees, an elegant brocade silk divan is the perfect contrast to the terra cotta pots.  Hanging above, a large painting framed in linden shows a beautiful watercolor of the Cascade of Tears.  The polished floor is graced by a narrow, fringed runner and gleams in the light of a cut-crystal chandelier.  A sweeping staircase descends to the foyer below."
