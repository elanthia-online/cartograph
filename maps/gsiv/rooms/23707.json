    "Tiny pinpoints of pale blue light twinkle throughout the thatched roof, casting sparkling illumination across the interior.  Moving shadows created from hanging paper lanterns flit here and there, dancing and swaying subtly from the breeze coming through the archway entrance.  A trio of mannequins are nestled to one side of a beaded curtain and a small display case occupies the opposite wall.",
    "Sunlight trickles through the thatched roof and archway entrance, casting dappled illumination across the wares.  A subtle breeze moves throughout the room, bring with it a bit of relief for the humidity and faint sounds of the jungle.  A trio of mannequins are nestled to one side of a beaded curtain and a small display case occupies the opposite wall."
