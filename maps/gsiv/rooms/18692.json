    "A bed sits centrally in the rectangular room, splitting it down the middle as the spine of a book and leaving two exposed pages of dimly lit, shadowed wooden floor.  At the foot of the bed is hung a high painting, its oil surface relucent with candlelight thrown up from the mantle of an inset fireplace.  Next to the fireplace is a silver wire basket of sticks.  A screen, wooden-framed with panels of silver-on-sapphire leather, sits behind the bed's head."
