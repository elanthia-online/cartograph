  "description": [
    "A deep valley, practically a ravine, darts between a pair of rumbling dunes.  The towheaded giants threaten to collapse in at any moment to crush the winding pathway of powder-fine sand.  In the middle of the fleeting trail, the constant shifting of the sands has revealed a bleached and fleshless bessho skeleton."
