    "Stretching from canyon wall to canyon wall, tall grass waves in the gentle night air like a dark ocean.  Several marble-columned arbors stand discreetly distant from each other, their flickering oil lanterns adding a touch of warmth to the peaceful settings for those gathering here.",
    "Stretching from canyon wall to canyon wall, tall grass waves in the soft breeze like a verdant ocean.  Butterflies flit among the myriad of blossoms that play hide and seek amid the slender blades.  Purple clover, golden aster, blue larkspur, and red monkeyflower dance as bees land on their heads.  Several marble-columned arbors stand discreetly distant from each other, providing peaceful settings for those gathering here."
