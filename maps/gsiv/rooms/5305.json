    "Several broken benches lay scattered across the floor, the golden velvet skin ripped to expose the cotton fluff innards.  Pages torn from books have been thrown to the nonexistent winds, unreadable now after years outside their covers.  A votive cup of yellow glass has been thrown against the stone wall, vaporized into a glittering powder that mixes unflatteringly with the thick dust."
