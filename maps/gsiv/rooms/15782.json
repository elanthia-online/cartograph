    "Beds of various size lie in precise ranks in this orderly barracks.  Small triangular pennants bearing the symbols of the various Arkati and lesser spirits decorate the room, and a large banner bearing the word \"Faith\" adorns one wall beside an opening in the ceiling that leads to the roof.  Near the stairway leading down is an oversize cabinet for the storage of herbs, bandages, and other implements of the healing arts."
