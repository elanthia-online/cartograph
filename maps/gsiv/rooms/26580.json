  "description": [
    "Fine dark grey sand gives way to larger pebbles of softer hue as the berm rises up from the flat beach and stretches toward the cliff wall.  Steep in its sharp climb, and created by the power of strong waves pushed ashore during storms, the waterline is clearly established at this geologic point."
