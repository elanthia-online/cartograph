    "Harsh gusts of wind cut through the trees causing you to shiver not only from the cold but from the shrill eerie music in the air.  Several stalwart modwirs seem to be the source of the songs for they stand against the fast moving air, vibrating in defiance.  Somewhere in the distance, you hear a bell clanking along with the singing trees."
