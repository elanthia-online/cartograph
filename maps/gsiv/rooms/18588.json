  "description": [
    "Half of this area has been dedicated to a variety of copper equipment, from great vats to coils of tubing that rise above, and sectioned off with a stout dark oak railing that supports panes of glass that reach to the rafters.  The mechanisms here don't seem to be in use at the moment, but from time to time, someone moves behind the glass, checking this or adjusting that.  In the space left for visitors, there is a long fel table with a grape-embroidered runner draped across it and a polished dark oak bottle rack close by."
