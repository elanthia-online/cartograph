  "description": [
    "Sections of split-rail fence create an enclosure with openings that lead to the very heart of the town.  While wreaths and greenery decorate the posts and rails of the fence, a small cart sits off to one side, looking slightly out of place with its gilded frame, wheels, and handles.  Atop the cart are several varicolored bowls, and the shelf beneath is littered with freshly cut flowers."
