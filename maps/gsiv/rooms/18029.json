  "description": [
    "Orange mud breaks through the icy surface of the road in several places, the copper tailings used as the foundation of the streets giving the mud its odd cast.  In other places, the thick sheet of ice has melted into the ground creating a slippery mire, dangerous to navigate.  The houses lining the roadway avoid the heavy foot traffic by the simple virtue of the walkways fronting the properties they occupy."
