    "Dust blankets the surfaces of the kitchen, from brass pots hanging from a ceiling rack to a large countertop built to slope towards a rusted metal sink.  A wood chopping block sits in the middle of the room, with a butcher's cleaver buried an inch into its surface, along with the skeletal remains of a chicken resting alongside it.  Many cooking instruments lie about the room as if the staff simply walked away and never returned, including an oversized metal spit in a looming fireplace across from the doorway."
