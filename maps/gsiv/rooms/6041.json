    "The farmland road bends west and northeast on its way between the fields.  The culvert on the northern side of the road turns and crosses the road to join with the culvert on the southern side of the road, and together they meander off to the southwest.  Wide cedar planks form a flat bridge spanning the northern culvert's change of course.  A spacious wheat field waves in the wind to the north, while a wide, rocky patch of ground harbors a turnip patch to the southeast."
