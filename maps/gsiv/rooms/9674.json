    "Silky runners blanket the smooth wooden floor, as sunlight streams in through circular skylights.  Standing forefront of the entrance is a small waiting area complete with a cushy circular bench ringing a ceramic planter bursting with delightful blossoms.  Sheer drapes curtain off the adjacent rooms, providing privacy to patrons as their innate beauty is brought to the surface, refined, and then polished.",
