    "Low ceilinged and cramped, the cavern has uneven floors and walls that are striated with purple algae and off-white calcite.  Iron-caged lanterns dangle from the ceiling to illuminate a strange tubular contraption, which resides over a banded oak-slatted bucket.  Pacing between an iron-bound warped oak chest and a dark glaes aquarium, a plump-faced gnome child watches over the area with a look that is a mixture of curiosity and amusement.  A knotted hemp rope provides an exit from the cavern and entry to the floor above."
