    "Glaes-topped wrought iron tables line the dark mahogany walls of this narrow room.  A deep scarlet carpet runs the length of the room, framed in by dark fel floor molding which has been embossed with repeating diamond shapes.  An intricately latticed, arched window faces the entrance from the opposite wall."
