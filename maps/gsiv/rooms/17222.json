    "A slightly elevated wooden platform surrounded by a ring of tall trees looks to be an ideal spot to rest or chat.  The sound of swords clashing can be heard nearby, followed by hearty laughter.  One of the Citadel staff stands just off the platform, perhaps waiting to deliver a message to the training administrator.",
