    "A wide steel counter runs along a parallel section of the western wall that has been fitted with sliding drawers housing a variety of skins, pelts, hides, and other cobbling supplies.  Thick inventory lists have been bound together in a book that rests on a table off to one side.  The mingled scents of leatherworking, tanning, and dying drift in from several directions."
