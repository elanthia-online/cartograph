    "The entrance to this room has been strewn with partially disarmed traps and tools of the trade, turning the first several steps into a bit of a maze.  A window along the back wall rises over a workbench, a small brazier and forge sitting next to a series of half-finished lockpicks.  A small cot takes up the eastern wall, and the only clear space on the floor is covered by a rug embroidered with a series of crossed lockpicks.  Hanging near the door is a portrait and a framed certificate."
