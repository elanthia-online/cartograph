    "Only the gods and the flies know just what's in the noisome pile of filth which blocks further progress down this alley, and perhaps it's best left that way.  Water drips from one overhanging balcony above into a spreading pool of brown mud.  Rats scramble about on errands, red eyes fixed forward on some unknown rat-goal."
