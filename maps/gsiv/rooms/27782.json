    "A wide hoarbeam table cluttered with richly dyed fabrics, pins, and a measuring tape is placed in the corner beside a tightly woven red and white basket.  A rosy-cheeked halfling woman wearing an iceblossom-adorned apron busies herself around the room, stopping only to shoo a small child with a chocolate-smeared face away from the assorted clothing.  Here and there, garments of various fabrics have been placed on display."
