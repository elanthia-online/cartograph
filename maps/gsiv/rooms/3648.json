    "Moonlight pours down, dappling the silver and gold-edged banners that billow out from the tall lampposts that line the street.  Light catches along their edges and glints off the surface, creating a shimmering reflection across the shopfronts.  Moisture clings to the evening air, causing it to feel cooler than it is.",
    "Moonlight pours down, dappling the silver and gold-edged banners that billow out from the tall lampposts that line the street.  Light catches along their edges and glints off the surface, creating a shimmering reflection across the buildings.  Set outside the door of one shop are several large wooden baskets, the white flowers housed within them glistening in the ambient light.  Moisture clings to the evening air, causing it to feel cooler than it is.",
    "Sunlight reflects off the silver and gold-edged banners hanging from the lampposts along the street, causing passersby to avert their eyes from the intensity of the glinting light.  The spacing between the buildings becomes more relaxed, wide enough to allow cobblestone alleyways here and there.  Large wooden baskets sit outside the door of one shop, brimming over with tiny white flowers and vines of ivy."
