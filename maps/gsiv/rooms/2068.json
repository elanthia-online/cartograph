  "description": [
    "All sound is muffled by the thick carpet of ash and weed that threatens to overtake this once thriving village.  However, even amid all the rubble and ruin a few structures remain intact.  A footbridge, which spans the river and cleaves the village into two halves, has seen better days -- but is probably functional.  The dark columns of the temple looming to the west are eerily reflected in the river below which lazily feeds a small cove to the south."
