  "description": [
    "Sprawling grounds radiate out from the courtyard past a ramshackle greenhouse to the west, while the eastern edge of the courtyard is backed by an expansive abandoned manor.  Scattered around -- and sometimes toppled over in -- overgrown hedges adorned with dried out seaweed and sea fans, rusted wrought iron benches provide ample viewing spots for a four-poster bed frame that partially covers the remains of a battered and broken fountain.  Shading a meandering pathway, several spindly trees spread their barren branches out overhead."
