    "A vibrant carpet of deep green and rich blue covers the well-worn oak floor.  Several large pillows lay scattered near the large marble hearth, inviting intimate conversation or a quiet doze.  Two chairs covered in the same rich blues and greens that adorn the carpet are pulled against the wall, as if the pillows are the seats of choice."
