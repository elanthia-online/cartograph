    "Dense jungle, dark and quiet, spreads out both below and above you, the vast array of ferns, bamboo, palms, and figs but a dot among the other foliage.  Just below, a thick blanket of water cascades into a large pool, creating a delicate roaring sound as the water crashes down.  A variety of blooms surround the pool, providing splashes of vivid color illuminated by the moonlight."
