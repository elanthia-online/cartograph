  "description": [
    "Lava pools and jumbles of sharp basalt and glaes rock combine for a hazardous passage across the plateau.  Smoke drifts and swirls, giving the landscape a dream-like appearance.  Faint trails wind through the magma pools in several directions, betraying the presence of wildlife tough enough to eke out an existence on such relentless terrain."
