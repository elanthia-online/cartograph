    "Dense canvas provides a dim interior for this space that is little more than a skeletal framework of thin stanchions.  The floor of the tent is amply hay-strewn as a hedge against the perpetual moist conditions of the boggy locale.  A pattern of barely discernible stains in the fabric of the tent has all the characteristics of blood spatter."
