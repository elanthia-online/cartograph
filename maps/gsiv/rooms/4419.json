  "description": [
    "The light of brightly burning brass lanterns glints off polished metals everywhere the eye looks.  Solid oak posts and beams serve as a support structure to prevent damage from cave-in.  All manner of metal armors and accessories fill the shop, pride of craftsmanship evident in how they are maintained and displayed."
