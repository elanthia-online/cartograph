    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of an unfinished wooden floor.  There is a vine-carved mahogany table on one side of the shop and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on the other."
