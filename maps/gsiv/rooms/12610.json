    "Dark red light emanates from the obsidian walls and ceiling, and the scent of thick, cloying incense fills the room.  Six high-backed chairs are arranged in perfect symmetry around a circular marble table.  You feel a sudden dread, as if you shouldn't be here at all, and glance about apprehensively."
