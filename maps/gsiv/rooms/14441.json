    "The cobalt-spotted leaper is housed in an airy habitat circumscribed by a sturdy fence that rises quite high into the air to prevent the powerful animal from escaping.  A low, rocky wall slopes southward to meet the jungle-like trees and vines that thrive in the moist earth.  Rocky ledges and slopes rise into peaks, forming a ridgeline to the north.",
