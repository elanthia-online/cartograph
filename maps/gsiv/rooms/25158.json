  "description": [
    "Massive columns of alabaster flank a pair of bronze double doors and continue in evenly spaced intervals along the western pathway.  Each pillar is entwined by an immense serpent of bronze, polished to a burnished luster despite the chaotic dance of the desert winds.  Miniscule grains of airborne sand shimmer in the sunlight, quickened into stinging motes by its furious heat."
