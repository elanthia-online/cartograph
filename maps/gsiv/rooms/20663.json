    "Adjacent to the swept pathway are a series of granite-blocked alcoves that offer privacy to those training in the inner courtyard.  Numerous hedges run neatly across the area, a strong earthy aroma rising from their loamy homes.  Long shadows stretch out from the nearby metal trees like crooked fingers."
