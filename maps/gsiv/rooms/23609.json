    "Thick bluish-green mold covers the walls entirely.  Sudden cracks and holes in the ground make walking treacherous.  In each corner of the room, stands considerably sized candelabras with partially burnt blood-red candles perched atop them.  A wooden lectern rests atop a raised, rock platform in the center of the room.  An old tome lies open on the lecturn."
