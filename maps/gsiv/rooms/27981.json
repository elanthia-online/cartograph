    "Towering poles line the muddy track, their tops housing colorful pennants and banners that snap and ripple in the arctic breeze.  Wrought iron baskets are set between each colorful display, each  filled with thistle, thatch, and wood.  To the east and southeast, the round faces of tree stumps seem oddly bright in the sunlight."
