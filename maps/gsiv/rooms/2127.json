    "Just to the north the main lava channel, several man-heights deep, cuts the valley from west to east.  From a vent in the volcano's side that is now shrouded in ash, the mountain's fire burned itself a trench.  The vagaries of nature have shifted the flow of molten rock to higher ground, and the lavabed now lies dark, its last contents frozen in an ebon mimicry of motion.",
