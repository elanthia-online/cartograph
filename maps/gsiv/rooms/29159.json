    "Standing out from the end of the pier like the spokes of a wheel, five docking slips flanked with small boardwalks are painted with bright red hues and bordered by hefty rope railings in the same hue.  Wrought iron horn cleats provide tie-off spots for incoming ships, some of which trail the frayed remains of hemp lines.  An arching sign supported by nearby pilings greets visitors with its blocky text that reads, \"Welcome to Kraken's Fall.\""
