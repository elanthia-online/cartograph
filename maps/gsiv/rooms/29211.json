  "description": [
    "Striated among the layered beds of soft white to pale grey limestone are deposits of fossilized trees.  Interspersed within the layered mosaic are droplets and formations of ancient tree resins.  By torchlight, the amber glows from a soft yellow, almost white, to a brilliant golden hue dispersed across the walls and floor.  Hidden within a few tear-shaped droplets are tiny spiders and a couple of ants, trapped for all time as inclusions within the precious baubles."
