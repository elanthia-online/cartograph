  "description": [
    "The mild scent of roses is carried in through the front door of the chilly entrance hall.  The corridor is subtly lit by smoky glaes sconces mounted on the grey marble walls.  A finely woven carpet of sturdy black and scarlet wool covers the floor and runs the length of the hall.  Placed flush with one wall is a tall, lacquered black walnut table bearing a basalt vase filled with white roses.  Fitted to the wall above the table is a circular eahnor plaque."
