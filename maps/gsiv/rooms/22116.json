    "Polished to a gleaming shine, an enormous pale oak table sits in the center of the room surrounded by high-backed chairs.  A silver and glass tray is centered upon a large sideboard that is placed under a silk draped window on the outer wall.  Woven from fine Vornavian wool, a tapestry map of Solhaven hangs opposite a linden door, its surface stitched with precise detail."
