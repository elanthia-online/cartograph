    "The surrounding air is heavy and thick, permeated with the salty scent of the ocean.  The far wall has been used as a large display, highlighting the assortment of native woods and barks available for bedding purchases.  Hanging from the silk-draped ceiling is an assortment of colorful sea stars, each dangling at various lengths from a cord of dried sea grass."
