    "Massive trees frame the river cutting its way through the jungle, their limbs laden with a dense canopy of leaves and creeping vines that is permeated with hazy shafts of moonlight.  The riverbed gradually gives way to moss-covered ground, and shadows dance across the rich soil to create brief, insubstantial images.  The dampness infused into the air from the river accentuates the ever-present mist overlaying the island, leaving a glistening dew upon everything it touches."
