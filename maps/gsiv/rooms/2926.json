    "Wintry gales rage freely across the flat expanse of this valley plain, cloaking the land in a gray fog of wind-born snow.  A mountain rises above the plains not far to the south, its snow-laced peak stabbing at the sky.  To the west, a strange dome rises out of the snow, all but concealed by its absence of color and the relentless flurries.  Anything that might be seen to the north is hidden beyond a curtain of swirling snowflakes."
