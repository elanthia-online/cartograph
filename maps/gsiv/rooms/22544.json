    "A bubbling cauldron dangles from a hooked tripod crafted of heavy chains and thick iron posts.  A stooped and leafless skeleton of an old banyan tree hovers over the vessel.  Several half-empty potion bottles and some stained brushes are strewn across a large tree stump, which apparently is being used as a makeshift workbench.  A heaping rockpile is centered within a star-shaped outline, which has been burned into the soil.  Various symbols of the elements decorate lanterns that encircle the setting."
