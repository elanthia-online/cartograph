    "The narrow lane is lined with neatly kept homes that enjoy a view of the river and the east bank in the distance.  To the north, a constant stream of town traffic passes over the stone bridge.  The high wooden wall that bounds the street to the west is painted with a colorful seascape of a sailing ship riding the waves."
