    "The rough warehouse is stacked to the eaves with scrap metal, scorched bits of wood, and other salvaged materials.  Scurrying noises in the shadows indicate that the scrawny, unkempt half-elf who oversees the operation may not be the only inhabitant of the room -- though he seems to be the only two-legged one."
