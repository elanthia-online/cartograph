    "A brick kiln puffs black smoke along the back wall of the development, hard at work firing pottery for use by the citizens of the town.  A drying rack sits next to the massive oven, covered with plates and vessels of every description.  On the other side of the structure, pieces of china await final touches before being taken to market for sale."
