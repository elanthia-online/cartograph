    "Resplendent banners of crimson and gold festoon the procession of columns to either side of the hallway.  At the center of the walk, a tremendous statue stands atop a tiered dais, haloed in the golden light of sconces adorning the nearby columns.  Sanguine-hued runners border sprawling walkways that delve into dark corridors to the east and west."
