    "A wide bridge spans the dark waters of the Locksmehr River to the west, groaning beneath the wheels of the occasional passing wagon or oxcart.  The shouts of drivers to move aside and the clicking noises they make to urge their weary animals along echo through the damp night air.  A gravel footpath leads north, and the outlines of a few buildings loom farther to the east.",
