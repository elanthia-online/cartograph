    "Resembling a cobblestone footpath more than a street, Tumbledown Lane levels out for only a few feet.  The street dead ends at the door of a stone cottage sporting an incongruous onion-shaped dome, nestled close in the shadow of the Northwest Tower.  Behind the cottage, the metal track runs past, headed down the hillside."
