    "Heavy creaking arises with even the lightest step upon the stairtreads and hallway planking, making a serrupticious rendevous in the adjoining inn rooms unlikely.  Bright copper sconces provide the only illumination, both day and night, in this windowless space.  Glass knobs reflect the dim, flickering light, inviting guests into each of four carved wooden doors.",
