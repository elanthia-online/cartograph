    "The eastern road leads closer to the river, which can be smelled but not seen from here.  The southern road constricts as it makes a straight cut towards the modwir palisade that surrounds the town, avoiding the maze-like side streets of the riverfront and Shanty Town, which are haunted by dockworkers, warehouse porters, and wharf rats.  A dusty pile of rubble might have been a building once, but whatever it was is unrecognizable now."
