    "Rocks of all shapes and sizes surround a small square of soil that appears to have once been a household garden.  The garden rows are full of rotting leaves and decaying vegetation, a myriad of mushrooms are the only things growing here.  A large dead tree stands guard over the simple plot of decay and fungi."
