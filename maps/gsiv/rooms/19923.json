  "description": [
    "A hand-painted globe and an oak bookstand displaying a tome bracket the main doorway of this long, narrow room.  At the center are a heavy map table, reading tables, and a bin containing the books and maps to be returned to the shelves.  Wrought iron lamps illuminate the neatly rolled charts and leather-bound volumes on the shelves against the high-windowed walls.  A stone stairwell spanned by a spiked steel gate descends through the north wall."
