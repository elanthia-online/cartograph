    "A low mithril gate stands at the entrance to Dervish Park.  The fence surrounding the sanctuary is obscured with a silvery haze, blocking the view of the grounds beyond as well.  The open gate is finely crafted from the purest mithril, beckoning visitors to enter and discover what lies on the other side."
