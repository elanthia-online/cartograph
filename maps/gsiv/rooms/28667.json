    "Seven silk tapestries adorn the polished limestone walls and an intricately woven rug covers the floor.  Rows of padded chairs occupy the center of the room and face a large viewing window.  A variety of refreshments sit on a low illthorn table next to an ornate faenor arch etched with runes.  Several polished brass sconces cast their illumination around the area."
