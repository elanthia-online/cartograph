    "Trailing from a heavy stone arch flush against the wall, a long stairway leads ever-downward to what seems an impossible depth, such that the ears pop and mild disorientation begins to tickle at the edge of the mind.  Though stale, the air is stirred by infrequent breaths that originate from a point of the passage further still.  At the base of the stair is a small landing flanked by iron-sconced torches."
