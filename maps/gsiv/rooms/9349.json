    "The soaring grey granite walls are scorched, but still standing, though the roof of this building is only a memory.  Windows can be seen spaced at even intervals along the walls, beautifully arched, but minus any glass to complete them.  Any furnishings that were once in this chapel have long since burned and been ground to dust, but the smoke-blackened altar remains as a testament to the belief of those who once worshipped here."
