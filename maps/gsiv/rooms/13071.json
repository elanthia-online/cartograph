    "Meager furnishings are neatly arranged in this sparse, utilitarian office.  Though plain in appearance, the desk and chair are polished and well-tended.  A single translucent glaes skylight focuses moonlight onto a circular stone set into the floor in the center of the room, right in front of the desk."
