    "The walls of this crude hut look as if they could collapse at any moment, their half-rotted planks held together with bent nails and frayed rope.  The lone back wall displays a rusted iron plaque hanging at a slant over a row of large chests, trunks, and crates.  A single lantern hangs precariously from one of the rafters, providing a dim, flickering light."
