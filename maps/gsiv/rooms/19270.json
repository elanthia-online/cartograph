  "description": [
    "Like a huge pair of eyes, two large, round windows look out over the eerie rough terrain far below.  The openings look out on a panorama of rocky desolation.  Huge, jagged mountains rise up all around, snow capped peaks high above ice covered slopes, strewn with large boulders.  The cold wind that blows in through the openings bears as much desolation as the view.  There is no scent of green trees and running sap, no odor of wildlife rising from the slopes outside."
