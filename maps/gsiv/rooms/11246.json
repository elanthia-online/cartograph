    "A long, sturdy oak table dominates the room.  Brass oil lamps hang from each corner of the room and a larger lamp dangles directly over the table.  On the shelves which line the walls are the dried husks of medicinal herbs. The cobweb-flecked walls are of white, reflective tile.  An instrument stand lies toppled on its side.  Bandages, medical instruments and herbs lie scattered across the floor."
