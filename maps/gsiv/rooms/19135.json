    "A trio of small bronze portholes streams sunlight into the tiny cabin, illuminating the collections of scented merchandise scattered throughout the room.  The rustic wooden plank flooring is fully cleared and swept clean, save for a carved rosewood box, an aged driftwood crate, and an iron-studded steel chest."
