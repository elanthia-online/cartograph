  "description": [
    "A single torch sputters and flares, but provides little more than a glimmer of light.  The room looks like it was dug out in a hurry and furnished just as quickly.  There are crates of medicinal supplies in the chamber, but many are crude and wouldn't be of much practical use for anything more than the tamest injuries.  A dwarven medic sits near the supplies on an over turned crate, occasionally exchanging an ale for a few coins to a wounded passer-by."
