    "A dirge emanates from an organ's deep pipes, crawls out of a nearby window, and settles its musical pall about the square.  Bright pennants make their best efforts at bringing up the mood, but the fog, the dark buildings, and the grey light that manages to batter its way through are steep obstacles to overcome."
