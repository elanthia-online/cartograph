    "Two large ovens occupy one wall opposite a wide-arched fireplace, a massive iron cauldron suspended inside.  In one corner, fragrant herbs hang from a tiered drying rack above a heavy worktable fixed with a hefty wooden chopping block at one end.  Steel-banded oak barrels are stacked beside a tall ice chest with a glass door."
