  "description": [
    "Though cramped, these small living quarters are as well appointed as any in an underground cavern might be.  Heavy iron sconces burning fragranced oil are mounted near the ceiling, invisible currents of air whipping the flames and teasing the smoke away through a crack in the stone.  A raised platform bed is tucked against the wall, pillows and an array of blankets and heavy furs layering the top.  Little more than an overturned ale cask and an accompanying stool serves as a small desk."
