    "A dozen cots are spaced evenly along the tent's walls, six to either side.  The cots appear well-worn but sturdy, and any bedrolls or blankets must come and go with each caravan hand that bunks here.  Wooden pegs are set into the tent's frame between the cots so the caravaners can hang up some of their belongings."
