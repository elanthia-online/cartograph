  "description": [
    "The scent of decay is prolific in this narrow alleyway.  A pile of wet, rotting leaves is obviously partly responsible, though something hidden beneath it likely contributes.  A single broad cobweb connects two balconies on either side of the street, hanging only slightly higher than an average human."
