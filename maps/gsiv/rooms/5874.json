    "A pair of large oak trees flank the gravel path, creating a canopy of leaves overhead.  Sunlight filtering through the leaves creates a mottled pattern on the ground.  Despite the sun, the air remains cool and crisp.  Somewhere nearby, the tranquil voice of a songbird dances in the air.",

    "Sunlight shines down upon a black marble marker, set into the ground amid a meadow of gently swaying flowers.  The marker is worn with age, but the inscription is still legible.  The sweet smell of wildflowers and the hypnotic humming of bees create a seductive setting.",
