  "description": [
    "Two of the walls are covered with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with old dusty books and several figurines.  The one large window has been boarded up, making it impossible to see out - or in.  A large moth-eaten tapestry, its colors faded, covers most of the dark rosewood floor.  Beautiful brass and crystal sconces illuminate the room.  All the original furniture has been removed, replaced by a podium and several rows of comfortable chairs for use in meetings."
