  "description": [
    "Music and laughter filter throughout the pub which is lit by glowing crystal globes hanging from the ceiling.  Leather club chairs and small cafe tables ring a stage to the south.  Behind the stage is a large curtain with the embroidered image of a smiling Cholen.  An expansive polished mahogany bar is centered in the room.  Above the bar is a silver-gilded mirror that reflects distorted, comical images of nearby patrons.  A clown face dart board hangs on the pockmarked west wall."
