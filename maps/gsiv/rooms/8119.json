    "A rock-walled furnace filled with red glowing embers stands a bit off center on the dirt floor.  Next to it are two large barrels filled with tepid water.  Gear in various shapes and forms hang on the wall or lie on the workbenches.  A much-abused axe rests on a large, steel anvil.  The air is heavy with acrid smoke.  A sooty door leads out."
