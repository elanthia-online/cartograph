  "description": [
    "Stacks of broken crates lean haphazardly against the walls, threatening to crash to the ground with each sway of the ship.  A long plank rests atop two overturned iron-banded barrels, displaying a variety of implements and supplies.  A thick iron chain hangs from the ceiling, supporting a rusty iron lantern, and rows of rough pine shelves flank a narrow, multi-hued glass door.  Several thick coils of rope occupy one corner."
