    "Minimal light filters through the tiny clerestory windows at the base of the squat, semi-circular dome above.  The red and orange swirl-patterned tile floor blends into a continuous alternating design of blue and ivory chevrons, just a few feet from the archway leading east.  Four rows of ivory columns fill the area, ending at a broad patchwork yierka-hide curtain across the back wall.  In the center of the room is a long buffet table, containing a variety of desserts.",
