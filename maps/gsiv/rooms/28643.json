    "Thick down comforters of black velvet sit atop fine spidersilk sheets.  Deep satin pillows lie against the headboard, obscuring several of the silvery runes carved there.  Hanging from the top of the bed are exquisite silver stars, moons, and other heavenly bodies, winking in and out in the dim light.  The air is filled with the dusky scent of amber, intoxicating to the senses and inspirational to the imagination."
