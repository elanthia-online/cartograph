  "description": [
    "A stately stained glass standing oil lamp sets a warm, welcoming glow in this simple cedar-framed room which holds a long pale oak table at its center.  Some chocolate-hued velvet wingback chairs are placed evenly around the table's length, resting on a polished hardwood floor.  Creating the entire panel of the back wall is an extremely large pane of frosted glass that has been carefully etched with an elaborate mural."
