    "An overwhelming stink is the most noticeable feature of this chamber.  It was obviously the kitchen for the old fortification.  There's a massive stone slab in its center that offers a generous work surface and an impressive hearth on the far wall, now cold and empty.  A litter of pot shards and old implements pepper the floor, looking as if they were thrown about in a fury.  However, there is nothing that suggests what is causing the terrible stench."
