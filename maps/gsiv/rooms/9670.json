    "A deep hole in the cave's floor divides the room in two.  Lining the wall on the other side of the hole are several small recesses.  Bundles of rolled parchment paper bound by a thin cord fill two of the nooks in the wall.  Clusters of deformed mushrooms crowd the corners, their mottled crowns drooping over as if weighted down with fluid."
