    "The pale maple floor's wide planks extend in all directions and pale ivory walls allow available light to bounce about best.  Three golden easels each contain the room's catalog, while sample signage is hung high against the walls, above the arches leading to other shops.  A broad, semicircular staircase leads down, its oak banister lacquered to a high gloss."
