    "Trees, enormous in size, dominate the landscape.  Diffused by the canopy of broad leaves above, dim moonlight dapples the surrounding plant life, transforming simple raindrops into lustrous pearls.  Flitting amongst the leaves of a large fig tree, a tiny bat feasts on figs and insects.  Unruly shrubs and ferns grow together into a dense thicket, the tightly packed vegetation offering ground cover for the jungle's smallest creatures."
