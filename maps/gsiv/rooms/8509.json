    "You approach an arc of curious looking dead trees.  Each has a small altar in front of it and seems to have died in a different manner.  One has had copper nails driven into it to poison its system, another has been exposed, stripped of its bark and so on.  They all bow towards the north, in silent homage to the seemingly lifeless hulk of an ancient mighty tree."
