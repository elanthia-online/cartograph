    "A stifling heat emanates from the massive stone forge that dominates the center of the chamber.  Ingots of rolaren, invar, and dark ora stand in neat stacks, ready for use.  The ruddy glow of the coals casts flickering shadows along the rough-hewn walls, where half-finished swords and maces cool in the darkness.  A set of dwarven hammers and tongs, well-kept and well-used, lean against the forge."
