    "A small arched door leads in to a small cabin located on-deck, its roof traced with twining patterns of stone-grey ivy carvings.  A short distance away, the sharp drop of the stern is guarded by curving railings of ornate design, and specks of silvery-bluish light peek from underneath the ship from the many scales of pure veniom plating its underside."
