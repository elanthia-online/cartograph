    "The polished surface of an ivory and rose quartz floor softly reflects the figure of a vaalin-traced ivory maiden statue, a central focal point to a long silver and glass semicircular display near the back of the room.  Lining wainscoted blush-painted walls is a series of full body dress mannequins set in poses that mimic those in an elaborate woven silk tapestry.  The sky motif in a dark walnut box beam ceiling lends a feeling of openness to the room."
