  "description": [
    "A milieu of potential combatants set about their preparations in this large, open field - readying themselves for the challenge ahead.  Beside a vermillion ribboned gate, an entry table accepts new registrants as they arrive.  Stableboys lead vermillion and black caparison bedecked mounts from an enclosed paddock to each rider in turn.  Across the way, a large weapon rack and a display of shields provides selections for each rider to equip themselves before engaging in the contest that awaits."
