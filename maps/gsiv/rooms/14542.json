    "The dark panels on the wall of the room are each carved with the image of an animal found in the zoo.  Long glass display cases are positioned throughout the area, filled to the brim with a variety of souvenirs.  A large sign hangs from the ceiling off to the side in an obvious ploy to garner attention."
