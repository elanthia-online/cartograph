    "A claw-footed desk of mahogany takes up half the space of this dark-paneled room.  Light streams from a magelight next to the overstuffed, wheeled and leather-clad chair that sits behind the desk.  A much smaller wooden chair, with its seat slanting slightly forward, sits on the other side of the desk.  The office is remarkably clean of personal effects, with the exception of an ornate cigar box resting on the right back corner of the desk."
