    "Three windows, each fitted into the curve of the cobalt blue, western wall, rise two hand-spans from the floor and stretch towards the exposed rafters of the ceiling.  Long, white shutters frame each piece and are neatly folded back to allow the bright sunlight to filter into the corridor.  Opposite the glassless casings, a tall double-wide arch leads into one of the bathing annexes.",
