    "Cabochon soulstones dangle from braided silver chains fastened to the ceiling, bits of emerald light glinting in their milky depths.  Bathed in their glow, a single branching ebony stand holds the only wares for sale on beds of night-hued velvet.  The sounds of the ship seem dimly muted, as if coming through swaddling cloth, though no such cloth exists to excuse the diminution."
