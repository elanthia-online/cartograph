  "description": [
    "Simple layers of sticks, bound by dried vines, form the roof and sides of this small structure.  A circle of charred rocks provides a safe space for fires and a few grass and reed mats draped in soiled canvas provide mud-free spots for bedding down.  Scattered shoes, most one-of-a-kind, are lined up beside the entry."
