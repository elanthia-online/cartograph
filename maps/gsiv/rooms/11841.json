    "Shattered statues of men and women lay across the path, bits of their arms and faces strewn about in the ankle-high grass that spreads across the square.  Here and there a leafy veil of vines has draped itself over one of the stone forms as if nature, in its mercy, has attempted to restore some measure of modesty and dignity to the fallen figures."
