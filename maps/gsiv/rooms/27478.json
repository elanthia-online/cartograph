    "The air in this area of the tent is stuffy and scented like smoke from the torches burning in each corner of the room.  The green canvas walls are marbled with gold thread that glints in the light.  A bin to one side contains several large containers, while a standing rack with hooks houses containers of a smaller nature.  At one end of the room, a ragged slit in the curtain divider leads out, while in the wall opposite, a break in the curtain leads deeper into the tent."
