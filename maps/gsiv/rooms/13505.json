    "Four sets of stone steps descend into this alabaster-tiled depression in the center of the neighborhood.  A massive shard of gold-veined quartz protrudes from the center of the depression, its faceted tip seeming to glow with a pale light under the dark night sky.  A natural spring gurgles about its base, forming bubbling fountains and small pools which dapple the area.  Small ferns and delicate mosses flourish in small cracks between the silvery, moonlit streams of water.",
