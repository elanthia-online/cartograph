    "The entire ceiling is taken up by the underside of a large replica flying dirigible.  A thick rope ladder attached to the metallic hull hangs down to the floor.  Two scale airship models are docked at a miniature terminus.  All four walls are painted in swaths of a pale blue with wisps of white, transforming the room into a mid-summer sky.  Near the connecting hallway, the painted sky burns red, caught in a forever sunset.  In the opposite corner, a glass-fronted mahogany cabinet holds a few glittering trinkets."
