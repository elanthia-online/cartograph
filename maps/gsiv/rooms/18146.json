    "A mosaic frieze, placed high up near the blue-lacquered wooden ceiling, depicts argent peacocks on a gentian blue band.  The birds, in pairs and triads, strut around the room, each group separated from the next by a silver tower with a fluttering pennon.  On a lower plane, a labradorite-capped mistwood counter partitions the room into distinctly public and private space."
