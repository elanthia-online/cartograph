    "Rafters of fresh pine support a peaked roof high overhead with gaily colored pennants hanging in neat rows from the struts.  Open windows allow air, and the occasional local avian, to circulate freely above.  The ground is a soft loamy soil over hard packed earth with numerous hoofprints radiating in wide circles around the center of the arena."
