  "description": [
    "The sounds of bustling traffic emanate far down the corridor to the southeast, but this tunnel has a rather unused feel to it.  Gigantic toadstools sprouting from large stone pots illuminate a floor covered with a thin layer of dust.  Footprints traveling in both directions mar the dusty layer, but the footprints are mostly obvious, well-defined, and rarely overlap.  A few cobwebs cling to the ceiling and walls, but even these appear to be abandoned by their makers."
