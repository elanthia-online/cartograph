    "Bold, contrasting colors and sharply defined edges dominate this large sleeping room.  Each wall is painted in a different color to evoke the areas surrounding Ta'Vaalor.  The east wall is a cool lake blue, the west wall a forest green, the south wall a golden wheat brown, and the north wall a mountain purple.  Dual candles in brass-and-glass cages adorn each wall, casting their soft lighting over the walnut furniture and light grey carpet, while two chairs nestle in corners, facing the spacious bed."
