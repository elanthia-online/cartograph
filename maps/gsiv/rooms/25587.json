    "The view from atop the gate encompasses the rolling grasslands and Yander's farm.  The bridge below is silhouetted against the brilliant blue waters of the Mistydeep River.  Crenellated parapets guard the top of the walkway above the Victory Gate and offer a safe vantage point for archers and spellcasters alike.",
    "Moonlight casts eerie shadows upon the walkway above the Victory Gate.  Crenellated parapets that rise and fall, give the impression of jagged teeth in the night and offer a safe vantage point for archers and spellcasters alike."
