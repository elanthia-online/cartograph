    "High in the branches of the oak, the thick growth of limbs, intersecting and crossing, offers an easy passageway between the trees.  The boughs are wide and easily traversed, and the moonlight is brighter here.  A break in the canopy offers a view of a granite outcrop near a stream crossing the forest floor below."
