  "description": [
    "The tunnelway winds like a serpent through the rock, lit only by the occasional torch anchored in gashes and bends in the walls.  Their light shines strikingly on bands of rich green jade, the vivid hue of the semiprecious ore stark against the prevailing dingy black stone.  A torn shred of pale silk is caught on an outcropping nearby, fluttering in air coming through an opening to the east."
