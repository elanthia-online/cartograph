    "The river of molten lava flows past the narrow ledge of rock like a living thing roiling with suppressed fury.  A rock cliff edges the perilous overhang, and large boulders stand to either side blocking further progress.  Loud pops and hissing from the magma punctuate the tenuous nature of this perch, as if the molten lava is deriding any attempt to find purchase on such a thin projection of safety over the river of death rampaging beneath."
