  "description": [
    "Although there are several patches of moist soil, the path is primarily filled in with pools of deep black mud.  The mud itself is riddled with small brown specks, leeches, that lay in wait to cling to a porous surface.  Beyond the mud, the river quietly drifts past, and ferns of every shape and size lean over its murky water."
