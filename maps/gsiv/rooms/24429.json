    "A modwir desk is the only indication that this room is used as an office.  Large windows provide a view of the pavilion against a backdrop of verdant forest, and a windowbox holds herbs that scent the air as the breeze stirs them.  A thick bow-shaped perch, jesses and a hood hanging from it, stands in one corner of the room."
