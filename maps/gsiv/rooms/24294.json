    "Dark night air fills the gaps between the trees here.  The only illumination is the far-off pinpoints of light that mark the presence of fireflies deeper in the woods.  Suddenly the forest is flooded with bright light as a line of torches burst into flame.  Making its way out from the underbrush and running past the torches is a path leading deeper into the darkness."
