    "A slight, widespread depression in the forest floor has gathered waters from previous floods.  The ridge along the riverbank blocks the drainage of water back into the river.  Clumps of long-bladed grass have popped up randomly in dry areas of the swamp.  Once mighty trees now lie rotten and moss-covered, victims of the soft ground's weakened support."
