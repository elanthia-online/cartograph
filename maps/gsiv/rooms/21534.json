    "Swathes of faded midnight blue silk line the weathered wood of the wagon's walls.  A tattered dirty rug covers uneven planks used to establish the shabby floor which is littered with rusted needles.  Glowing crystal orbs are haphazardly scattered throughout the room, providing barely enough light to see.  A broken glass display case, stained with a bit of blood on one side, occupies a bit of floor space along one wall.  Against the opposite wall, a bent wire jewelry tree has been settled on top of a rotted oak end table."
