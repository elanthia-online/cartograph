    "Natural columns formed from aragonite lead inward toward a mid-sized crystal-clear table, which is set in the center of the chamber.  A huge leather-bound ledger with gilded pages lies open upon the tabletop, its columns filled in a neat hand.  On the upper right hand corner of the desk rests a delicate rainbow quartz vase overflowing with wild roses.  Several acolytes dressed in hooded white robes stand attentively on either side of the desk."
