    "Brightly colored banners hang in the windows of the various shops here, all of which are turned to face eastward.  Manicured gardens adorn the yards of the homes, while tall trees, their leaves overhanging a wooden park bench, provide a place for rest and shade.  A small sidestreet, partially paved with stone, leads away from the area, back down toward the northeastern section of town."
