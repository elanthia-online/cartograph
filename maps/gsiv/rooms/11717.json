  "description": [
    "Spiraling up and down is a massive stone staircase decorated with a faded red rug held in place by narrow gleaming brass bars and pins hammered into the side of steps.  A chilling draft flows up from the darkness below, carrying with it a strong sense of decay and death.  Set on the wall above the upward-destined steps is a slashed painting hung within a gold gilded frame."
