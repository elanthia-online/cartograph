    "Brightly colored safety ropes surround a central trapdoor, attempting to prevent the less wary from falling through it.  Polished modwir planks form the walls, floor and ceiling of the boarding cabin.  Coils of ropes and a pile of harnesses fill a corner of the sparse room, and a sturdy steel door leads into another area of the craft.  An iron-edged modwir sign rests against a nearby wall."
