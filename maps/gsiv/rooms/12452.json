  "description": [
    "The Hedgerows neighborhood is lovingly maintained by a local landscaping crew that participated in creating an idyllic area with flowering plants and trees everywhere.  A florid arch marks the entry to the formal gardens, the flowers on it different colors depending upon the season and which vines are blooming.  Traffic streams across the avenue, many people passing through the arch on their way into or out of the gardens."
