    "A duo of wrought iron gargoyles stand watch high above a towering gate, their onyx-inset eyes glinting alongside the fiery torches set beneath them, engulfing the pair in red-orange flames.  Steel-headed pikes and shattered arrows lay broken along the fortified stone walls, piled high alongside several yellowed skulls of various origins.  A faded oriflamme lays shredded across the metal gate, the elaborate embroidery stained in black and red."
