    "At the edge of the road, a rough wooden fence separates the land to the west from the road itself and the rhubarb fields to the east.  The top railing of the fence is painted a fresh white color, but the bottom rail is the same dull brown as the entire fence further along down the road.  Several paint brushes lie on the ground next to one of the posts, their brushes plastered over with dried white paint."
