    "Despite the enormous amount of noise the forest makes, it is surprisingly peaceful.  Within earshot, the nearby river rushes through the trees, splashing over rocks and fallen limbs in its quest towards the ocean.  Insects chirp and squeak, their many voices coming together in a mishmash of sounds that somehow seem musical."
