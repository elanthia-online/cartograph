    "Varnished ebonwood walls rise from a dark-stained oak floor.  Just above a sphere-topped black marble fountain hangs a trio-bladed mounted vellum fan, and an ebonwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  A gold-leafed mistwood cabinet and a cedar and oak footlocker stand side by side in the middle of the room."
