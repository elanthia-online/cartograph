  "description": [
    "The toadstools in this short section of tunnel have been arranged to throw bands of colored light on the ceiling.  Red, amber, green, blue, silver, and light grey bands arc across the ceiling.  Despite the bands of light, the tunnel is dimly lit.  A wide entry yawns in the wall to the north, and a silver sign decorated with the shapes of musical instruments sits on the wall above the entry.  On the east wall, a brass sign hangs next to a thick iron door."
