    "Brightly lit and painted in warm cream tones, the tidy room is filled with desks, all orderly arranged in groups.  A large chalkboard dominates the far wall, which has been covered in a clutter of writing.  A light grey-robed woman sits at a wide oak desk, flipping through the pages of a thick tome."
