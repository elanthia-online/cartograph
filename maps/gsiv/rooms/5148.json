    "This strand of cliff top is flat, and soil and sand have mixed here, providing hold for many grasses and plants.  The moon shines brightly overhead, and the smell of strawberries growing near the edge of the cliff permeates the air.  The cliff top provides a magnificent view of the entire beach to the southeast, and the pine woods to the east.  The broken masts of a beached ship rise at an angle high above the beach.",
