    "Water streams between large moss-covered boulders at the edge of a cliff, forming a small waterfall that cascades to the valley floor below.  Lichen-draped trees grow right up to the cliff's edge, blocking much of the view.  Birds glide above the misty treetops below, their screeches partially blocked by the sound of rushing water.  Purple and white orchids grow in large clumps near the base of the trees, while small frogs rest on rocks by the water."
