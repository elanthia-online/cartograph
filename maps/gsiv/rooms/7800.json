    "A huge ring of blackened and scorched stones sits in the center of this small clearing.  Scattered about can be seen the bones and belongings of a score of creatures and beings.  To the north, the river cuts a wide blue ribbon through the landscape before disappearing between the thick trees and the foothills.  Leading out of the clearing is a wide trail."
