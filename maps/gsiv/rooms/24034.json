    "Polished stone walls reflect the light of a trio of iron-banded torches that has been inset into ornate brackets.  Centered over a brick-lined tunnel is a deep azure banner that reads \"Arena Entrance\" embroidered in thick flaxen thread.  A flaxen banner over an azure arch reads \"Viewing Chamber\" in elegant azure embroidery."
