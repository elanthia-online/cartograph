    "Several magnificent willow trees line the southern edge of the large pool, their roots thriving on the water.  The view of the falls is unobstructed and you are able to discern a natural rock formation that appears to span the top of the falls.  Water from the pool flows underground, only to emerge again as a stream to the south."
