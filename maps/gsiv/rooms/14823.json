    "Located roughly in the center of the glade is a small log cabin.  It seems to be made predominantly of oak, with cedar and mahogany trim.  A tall stone chimney protrudes from the roof, a wisp of grey smoke drifting from the top.  The smell of scented wax comes from the cabin's general direction.  Written above the door are the words, \"Mourner's Cabin.\""
