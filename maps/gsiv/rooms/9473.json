  "description": [
    "A very elegant nook serves as the place of transaction for those wishing to convert currency or notes.  White marble walls, ceiling and floor with veins of gold coursing through them give the room a rich appearance.  Polished brass bars enclose the teller's window, and the toadstool that lights the room is set into a circular, polished brass pot.  Its one light is ample to illuminate the entire area brightly."
