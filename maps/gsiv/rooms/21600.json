  "description": [
    "Despite the tree's height, the view of the surrounding grounds from this vantage point shows little more than moss-covered treetops.  Knotted branches bend and sway with every step and the lack of four walls offers no security from a potentially fatal plunge.  A small bird's nest is perched on a branch amidst a thick cluster of leaves and moss, and deep hollows scar the trunk."
