    "The air bends and shimmers here, odd sounds popping and humming in the distance.  The cavern is huge, surrounded by smooth polished rock walls that constantly shift between shades of light and dark.  Descending from the tunnel above, rays of bright moonlight shine down, bathing the entire earthen floor in a pool of silver light."
