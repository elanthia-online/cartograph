    "A simple floral tapestry hangs on one of the white-washed ash walls, and a white painted ceiling rises overhead.  A white vanilla orchid-filled vase sits in one corner of a terra cotta clay tile floor.  There is a small white wicker basket on one side of the shop and a large white wicker display on the other."
