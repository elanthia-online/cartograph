  "description": [
    "The walls of the tunnel are cool and dry to the touch.  Carved out of redstone, the tunnel is wide enough and tall enough to accommodate three giantmen walking abreast.  A phosphorescent mineral vein through the redstone provides a dim light.  The tunnel slopes gradually to the southwest deeper into the earth."
