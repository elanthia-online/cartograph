    "Precariously balanced crates and boxes line the walls of the office, marked with jagged dwarven scrawls.  Groups of dwarves wander in and out, slapping each other on the back and laughing as they drag more boxes in and out.  A mangy grey cat lies curled up in a corner, lazily peering at you with a mildly curious expression."
