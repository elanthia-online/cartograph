    "Gloops and globs of odorous mud occasionally fall to the ground with a sloppy wet-sounding *splat* from the surface of the misshapen walls; Wet muck steadily oozes its way through the partially decomposed wooden planks that offer little to their purpose of restraining it.  Squat, rotted wooden posts are sunken into the grungey floor, some taller than others, and each are affixed to the ceiling via rusted iron chains.  Scant light peeking in from the main cellar's room provides the only illumination."
