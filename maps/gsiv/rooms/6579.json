  "description": [
    "The vaulted ceiling is low, and as a result, the room seems warmer than most of the other parts of the castle.  The chamber is in remarkably good condition -- the large fireplace still possesses its decorative carving and a few furnishings survive intact.  By far, the most noticeable thing in the room is the large mirror hanging above the hearth.  It seems to absorb and amplify the low light drifting in through the narrow slit windows."
