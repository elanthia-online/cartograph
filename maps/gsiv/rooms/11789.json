    "An elegant scrolled iron fence that must have been constructed years ago serves as a border to this grassy plateau.  The brackish waters of the swamp haven't invaded this area yet, and several lush gardens decorate the modest homes.  The cheerful sounds of a whippoorwill fill the air with song, the bird deeply hidden within one of the thickly leaved trees."
