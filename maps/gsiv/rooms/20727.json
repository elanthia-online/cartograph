    "Chairs, sofas, and divans are scattered about the room, focusing on an ornate modwir podium.  A large brass cart rests beside a huge velvet-draped picture window, a seat built into the wall giving a perfect view of the rolling green lawns outside.  Frosted crystal globes hang about the room, suspended from copper hooks set in the walls.  Covering most of the wooden floor, a plush ivory carpet contrasts with the rich colors of the room."
