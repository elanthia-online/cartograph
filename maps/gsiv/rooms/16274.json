    "A line of wooden spikes has been set into the ground on either side of the path.  Impaled on each spike is a skull or partially decomposed head.  Flies buzz in a noisy cloud around the heads.  The rank odor of decaying flesh mixes with the sweet smell of the flowers that grow on the lianas that cover the stone ruins."
