    "Numerous small coffers and chests rest upon many carved stone shelves in the shop.  The soft white light cast from potted toadstools illuminates the sparkling wares for sale here.  Occasionally, gems will fall from a large hole in the back wall, accumulating in an iron-reinforced cart.  The jeweler carefully sorts them by type, color and quality into the surrounding containers, from which she harvests only the choicest jewels for her bauble creations."
