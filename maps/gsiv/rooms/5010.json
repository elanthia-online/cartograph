    "The level ground of the old riverbed suddenly disappears as the ground falls away to the east amid a jumble of boulders and fallen branches where a rushing waterfall must have once filled the still air with mist countless years ago.  A huge formation of piled rocks bounds the northern entrance to the ravine, and the more traversable ground of the forest rises in a shady hillside to the south.  High moors rise beyond the deep ravine, their geography shrouded in clouds of darkening mist."
