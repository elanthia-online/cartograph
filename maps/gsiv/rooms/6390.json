    "You are in a huge, irregularly shaped cavern.  It appears as if shallow hollows have been carved from the stone walls all around the cavern.  Each of the hollows is approximately 7 feet long, 4 feet high and 4 feet deep, and all appear to be empty.  All surfaces are covered with a fine black grit."
