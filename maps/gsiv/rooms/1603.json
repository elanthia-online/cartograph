    "Flanking the opening in a tall, black, wrought iron fence that surrounds the perimeter of the park are massive twin griffin statues, placed to face each other.  The creatures have reared up on their hind legs, one clawed hand reaching out so that they touch talons high overhead.  Emblazoned upon the gates in gleaming golden plating are the letters \"S\" and \"A.\""
