    "Behind the small wedding chapel off to the southwest sits two parallel rows of stables.  Wooden walls have been pristinely whitewashed and the thatched roofs are expertly maintained.  One of the east side azure-shuttered doors has been left open and a small, brown-spotted dog rests lazily in the ensuing shade.",

One of the east side azure-shuttered doors has been left open and lantern light illuminates the stall with a golden glow."
