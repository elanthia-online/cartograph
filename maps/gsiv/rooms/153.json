    "A small freshwater stream approaches the path from the south here.  The stream is small and shallow, but the banks show signs of it swelling tremendously in heavy rain.  Trickling water and the occasional hoot of an owl can be heard here, providing a change to the stark silence of the pine woods.",
    "A small freshwater stream approaches the path from the south here, and many small animals gather near the bank to drink.  The stream is small and shallow, but the banks show signs of it swelling tremendously in heavy rain.  Trickling water and the occasional call of a bird can be heard here, providing a change to the stark silence of the pine woods."
