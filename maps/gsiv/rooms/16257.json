  "description": [
    "The ground of this triangular-shaped jungle clearing is covered by a series of large flat stones tightly joined to create a sort of courtyard.  Long, waxy-leaved vines grow in profusion, stretching between the few riverstone pillars still standing.  A pair of moss-covered, oblong boulders are arranged side by side near the center of the courtyard."
