  "description": [
    "Pushed up against the wall between two dirt piles, the skeleton of a vermin-like critter is surrounded by a buzzing field of flies and crawling with ghostly maggots, its rent flesh exposed and torn from the belly of the tiny body.  A fallen torch, flame long extinguished, is half atop the small corpse, possibly the cause of death."
