    "Cord-like creeper vines trail across the slender game track that cuts through this section of undomesticated jungle.  Growing from vibrant green vines which wrap around broad trees along the path are bright yellow and pink wild roses.  Cockatiels and toucans occasionally fly through the area in a pageantry of color and noise."
