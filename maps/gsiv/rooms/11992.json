    "The interior walls of the tower are composed of the same roughly hewn granite blocks as the exterior of the structure.  A star chart, partially obscured by dust and debris blown in from the outside, has been carved across the polished marble floor.  Stone steps circle around the perimeter of the circular room, one flight leading up and a second flight descending to the floor below."
