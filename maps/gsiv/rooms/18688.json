  "description": [
    "The walls are lined with glass-fronted cases, within which bristle clusters of sharpened and gleaming arms.  In the middle of the room a life-sized statue of a fully armored woman stands atop a tall plinth.  Above her is a dome of mosaic glaes, the silvered tiles of which reflect the mailed top of her head and the bronzed crown upon it."
