    "Encircled by a low travertine wall, the manicured lawn is pockmarked with tidy, dwarf mounds of verdant blue fescue and silvery blue oatgrass.  Smooth limestone boulders are arranged in evenly spaced, semicircular rows that face a copper and haon lectern in the southwestern section of the expanse.  High above and stretching from one end of the lawn to the other, a canopy of loosely woven netting dangle a plethora of frosted globes that dispel the darkness from the this section of the gardens."
