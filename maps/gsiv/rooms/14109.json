    "A large four poster bed with white curtains and a white bedspread dominates the room.  The walls are covered in sailcloth, with several pictures of ships at sea breaking up the monotony.  Across the room from the bed is a mithril table with two chairs under a white curtained window looking out over the bay and its busy quays."
