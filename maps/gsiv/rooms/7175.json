    "Toppled tombstones lie in broken pieces on the ground where the grass, briar bushes, and dead leaves nearly obscure them from view.  Two grave markers remain standing, one leaning against the other, both cracked and crumbling.  Thin boards and bits of splintered wood, rotten with age, show the destruction of more than one grave site.  Nothing remains of the bodies once buried in the plundered graves."
