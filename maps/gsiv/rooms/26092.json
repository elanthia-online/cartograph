    "No more than two-feet high, a wide wooden board carved with straight lines and curved shapes encircles the room.  At each corner, a crystalline moon hangs from the ceiling and spins with abandon.  An unadorned staircase spirals downward into a chamber illuminated by a deep amber glow.  Sculpted from heavily crimson-laced slabs of ur-barath, a pulpit stands in solitude in the center of the room."
