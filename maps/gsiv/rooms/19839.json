  "description": [
    "Thick boughs of surrounding trees encroach upon this large garden, giving it an air of perpetual darkness despite the light that filters through the leaves.  Purple nightshade blossoms grace the verdant carpet, edging small meditation platforms that rest in the four corners.  In the center, a series of square markers hewn from rough marble surround a painted bronze sculpture, each small block of stone incised with the symbol of a different Lornon Arkati."
