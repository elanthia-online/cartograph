    "Set back from the rest of the tent is a large, elegantly furnished workroom.  Soft pillows crafted from vibrant material are piled about the floor by a polished driftwood bench.  A rich carpet of bright silk covers the floor, a pattern of tropical feathers giving it a colorful texture.  Whimsical patterns of dancing dragonflies are carved into the frame of a wide tigerwood board that hangs next to a silk-draped archway."
