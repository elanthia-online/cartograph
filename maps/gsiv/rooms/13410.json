  "description": [
    "The modest home to the west appears to be well-cared for, its paint fresh and vibrant, while a variety of trailing flowers spill from its windowsills.  A large target stands to the side of the house, its surface bearing quite a number of slitted holes.  Shadows play across the deep green grass, and a few small cherry trees huddle against the protective walls of the manor."
