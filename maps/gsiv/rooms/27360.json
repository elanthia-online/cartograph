    "Jewel-colored flowers and hummingbirds are painted with finesse on the slate grey walls of the small wagon.  Mossy green vines sprout from a few cracks in the wooden plank floors under an aged yew chest, the smaller tendrils winding their way around the bases of a gnarled modwir trunk and a woven black willow basket.  A shadowed corner in back houses a glass-paneled cedar cabinet topped with an ornately carved maoral case."
