    "Cluttered with fallen leaves and heavily laden with dirt and grime, the interior of the small shack has suffered from exposure to the elements and neglect.  Even though the warm glow of sunlight filters down through bare beams which once held a thatched roof, the broken remnants of a table and a few scattered chair legs are coated with a thin greyish mold.  A stone hearth sits cold and empty within one of the crumbling walls.",
