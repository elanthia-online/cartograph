    "A Four Winds Isle map hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A wooden lighthouse figurine sits in one corner of a swirled sea glass floor.  There is an aqua-hued seaglass display on one side of the shop and a long mistwood counter on the other."
