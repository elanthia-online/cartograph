  "description": [
    "A full-ceiling fresco of a lush medicinal garden tended by robed figures complements the pots of herbs lining the pale wood floor.  Pushed against one wall is a many-drawered apple wood apothecary cupboard topped with slate blue sandstone.  Twin pots of calamia and pennyroyal flank a glass door, thriving in the slightly humid air."
