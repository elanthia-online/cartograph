    "Gracious and welcoming, this well-appointed foyer is floored in a buttery cream marble, which is subtly veined with smoky grey.  Blue glaesine windows are set into the walls at wide intervals, allowing a small bit of sunlight into the room.  The main source of illumination is an elaborate silver chandelier hanging far above, suspended from the high, arched ceiling.",
