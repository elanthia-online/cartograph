    "Ornate carvings on the walls fill the wagon, in what appears to be a story in pictures.  Fine satin covers the floor protecting the wood beneath, while creating a slippery ground to walk upon.  Some gold racks and some gold shelves cover the only non-carved wall in a circular design centered around the pearl-hemmed curtain and an exquisite pearl-edged sign."
