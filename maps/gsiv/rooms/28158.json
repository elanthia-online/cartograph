  "description": [
    "Lanterns housing eldritch flames illuminate this coffee and spice scented hallway that connects various areas of the galleon below decks.  Heavy midnight carpeting and a large tapestry muffle any noise of passers-by.  Similarly carpeted, a stairwell with chrome handrails rises to the deckhouse above.  A reinforced door on one wall bears the crest of House Illistim.  A dark portal leads aft towards the cargo hold."
