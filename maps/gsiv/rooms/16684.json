    "The entire western wall has been made into a giant bay window which reveals an expansive view of the Isle and sea beyond.  The splintered driftwood wall directly across from the window is the backdrop for a large saltwater aquarium that stands against it.  The water of the aquarium casts a dancing reflection across the room as streams of light shine in through the window."
