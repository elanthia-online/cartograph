    "Pale white cotton is draped over the frame of the geteld, creating a warm, yet airy, structure.  A pile of beige and cinnamon cotton pillows is scattered about a rounded bronze brazier.  Woven carpets of wool dyed in various shades of greens are layered over the floor.  Resting to one side is a low red maple table with a small woven straw basket tucked beneath it."
