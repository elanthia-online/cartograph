    "An expanse of green field lies all around the path, dotted with the white fluffy bodies of grazing roltons.  Several thatched cottages stand by the wooden fence that bounds the area.  A small pack of sheepdog puppies scamper in the grass, fighting over a scrap of cloth.  A cobblestoned path leads north into a small village."
