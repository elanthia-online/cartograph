    "Cast-off easy chairs dot the amphitheater's green room, providing comfortable seating for actors waiting to go onstage.  In the center are an oval table and several ladder-backed chairs, and along one wall sits a paint-spattered dressing stand next to several stacks of wooden folding chairs.  Last minute appearance checks are facilitated by a full-length mirror mounted beside the door.  A scent of greasepaint and dust lingers lightly throughout the room."
