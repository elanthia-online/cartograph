  "description": [
    "Casks, barrels, and crates rise from the pine floorboards to the exposed rafter ceiling and occupy virtually every available space of the small store room.  Dim light spills through the door that leads into the tavern, while a bright glow spills on the bottommost steps of a rough pine staircase.  Several bundles of rushes bound together by wire are stacked in the center of the room."
