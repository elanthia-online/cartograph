    "Prickly bits of dried grass poke under any loose clothing and lightly scrape over exposed flesh as you maneuver down the narrow corridor the tightly packed hay bales provide here.  The massive bales of hay lean precariously inward and sway slightly as if they are going to topple downwards onto your head.  Thankfully, they are securely lashed into places by ropes made of sturdy hemp."
