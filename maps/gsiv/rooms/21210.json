    "Brightly illuminated by copper lanterns, this section of the passage is filled with odd whirring sounds that are punctuated by strange pings.   Thick, black iron grates stretch across the floor over a moat of crystal clear water that has been trapped within an enormous basin lined with white tiles.  Brass and copper tubes rise out of the floor only to disappear into the ceiling, while the northeastern wall is covered in a waterfall that feeds the basin beneath."
