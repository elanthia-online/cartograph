  "description": [
    "Carved out of the rock beneath the tower, this room is barely large enough to be referred to as such.  Not even a halfling could lie down in the small amount of flat space that exists for a floor, and the walls slope upward and outward so that it would be difficult to sit and lean against one of them.  A thin layer of moldy straw covers the bit of floor beyond the sweep of the door."
