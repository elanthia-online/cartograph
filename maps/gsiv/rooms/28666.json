    "The wide, smooth white marble floor continues in a southern arc, flanked on the northern side by dozens of limestone columns.  The moonlit trees of the Siren's Wood can be seen through the columns.  Inset into the limestone of the southern wall are an ornate faenor arch etched with elven runes and a wyvern-etched vaalorn arch, above which hangs a banner displaying the crest of House Vaalor."
