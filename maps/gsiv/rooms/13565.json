    "A curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a dark and light oak ceiling rises overhead.  A woven Vornavian silk rug sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is a Vornavian silk-lined display case on one side of the shop and an elegant silver jewelry rack on the other."
