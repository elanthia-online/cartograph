    "Polished black marble peeks out from beneath the edges of a richly appointed ivory velvet carpet which stretches down the expanse of the hall.  A woven bamboo rack holds a miniature catapult and a pile of tiny iron balls, and a single window at the far end of the hall lets in sunlight and an ever-present, albeit faint, hint of an ocean breeze and salty air.",
