  "description": [
    "Barnacle encrusted scraps of lumber are all that remain of the boardwalk around this southern part of the square.  Once thriving, this entertainment section is now an allectation for other sport.  Malcontents and ne'er-do-wells loiter between the abandoned buildings.  A hairy dwarf begs for silvers from those who venture too close."
