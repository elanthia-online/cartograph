    "The wide-planked floor is slightly warped from the damp.  A small turf fire burns in a brass brazier, providing both warmth and a flickering golden-hued light.  The whitewashed walls have faded over the years into a soft yellow color that is reminiscent of aged ivory.  A lingering sense of tranquility suffuses the room.  A low altar stands before an oaken statue of Niima, the Wavedancer."
