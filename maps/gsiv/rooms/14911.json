    "The lush riparian growth accompanying the slow creek tapers off to a small stand of chaparral, as the thinning stream slips into a narrow crevice in the wall of rock that surrounds much of the canyon.  Three glorious waterfalls spill forth from the plateau above, each uniquely different.  Silvery moonlight is reflected from each, like the sparkling facets of a pure diamond.",
