    "Tall shelves crammed with dusty books leave but a narrow corridor to the low desk at the far end of the room.  A faded green velvet curtain falls halfway across a large window, the rippled glass casting watery patterns on the oak floor.  A lone fly buzzes in the very center, describing drunken circles in the heavy air."
