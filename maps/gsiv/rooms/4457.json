    "When compared to the lantern-lit expanse stretching away to the east, this section of the oak-braced tunnel seems dim, but candlelight blazes in a circle around the life-sized iron dwarf statue standing sentinel in the dead end.  To either side, the rock face has been carved with images of mace-wielding dwarves fighting through an onslaught of banshees and skeletons.  An ancient dwarven monk sits on a prayer rug at the statue's feet.  Five talismans are displayed upon a tray beside her."
