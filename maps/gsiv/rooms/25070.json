  "description": [
    "The cobblestone pavers underfoot are a shade of charcoal, blackened from fire that swept through the courtyard, scorching the earth and rocks.  Carved from a solid mass of stone, a dark passageway leads down into an underground dungeon.  Mounted on either side of the cavernous opening is a pair of glaes-paned lanterns.  An open wooden crate filled with supplies sits near the entrance."
