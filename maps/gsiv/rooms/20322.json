  "description": [
    "Slime-ridden plant life, duckweed, and fallen trees cover the water here, creating navigational barriers in almost every direction.  The result is brackish, standing water laced with a repugnant odor that smells like a cross between sulphur and a well-used animal's burrow.  Glistening in thin, feeble shafts of moonlight, the water appears to be as thick as grease, its waxy texture leaving a gooey residue on the nearby shore.",
