    "Dozens upon dozens of chandeliers of multitudinous sizes and designs drip down from the ceiling at varying lengths, with several hanging so low that they brush the ground.  The majority of the chandeliers are fully aflame with light, save for the unlit handful suspended over the dead center of the area.  Interspersed between several of the larger, more elaborate pieces are several hard-backed steel chairs, with thin, jaggedly shaped mirrors and tiny steel grates imbedded into the floor around them."
