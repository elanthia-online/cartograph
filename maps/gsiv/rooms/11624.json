  "description": [
    "A great, grotesquely malformed oak tree towers overhead.  Skeletons and bodies in advanced states of decomposition dangle upside down from the tree's contorted branches like obscene fruit.  Scattered among them are ankle and footbones still attached to fraying lengths of rope.  Beneath the tree is a jumble of mouldering bones and fallen skeletons.  The stink of corrupt flesh hangs heavy in the fog."
