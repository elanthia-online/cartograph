    "A small garden, surrounded by a low rock fence, lies next to one of the houses.  In one section of the garden grow carrots, cucumbers, cabbage and a few other hardy vegetables.  Thyme, parsley and other unusual looking herbs grow elsewhere.  The garden adds a very comfortable, almost rustic, homeyness to this area."
