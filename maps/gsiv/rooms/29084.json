    "Heavy chains stretch across the open precipice to the south, where a large platform surrounded by rollways of loose timber sits quiet in the starlight.  Steel cables sway in the seaborne breeze, the bardon hooks on their ends clanking quietly as they move.  A single lantern illuminates a roofed workstation where barking irons are carefully stowed."
