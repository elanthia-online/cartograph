    "Moonlight trickles in from outside to provide a small measure of visibility.  A corroded copper ladder is revealed, recessed in the lone interior wall.  Beside the ladder, a deteriorated black ash door leads towards the bow.  The exterior walls are badly weathered, and the copper-framed windows set within them have not held glass in ages.  Flexing precariously underfoot, a wooden deck creaks and groans with each step.",
    "Sunlight pours in through five large glassless, copper-framed windows set within the boat's badly weathered exterior walls.  A corroded copper ladder is recessed in the lone interior wall, leading up.  Beside the ladder, a deteriorated black ash door leads towards the bow.  The wooden deck creaks and flexes precariously underfoot."
