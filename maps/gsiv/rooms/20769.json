  "description": [
    "A wood-framed window in the outer wall is wide and low, providing a view just above the water level.  Silk pillows in vivid colors placed around the curved wall of the semi-circular room enable guests to arrange themselves in comfort, while the flat inner wall contains a narrow white archway that leads out, as well as several dimly lit tables complete with matching chairs.  Between the tables, potted plants offer a light floral scent to the room which complements the salty breezes from the porch beyond the archway."
