    "After snaking around a series of rocks grouped around the narrow crevice giving egress, the chamber widens into a comfortable size.  Around the perimeter are hollows where drifts of small boulders have been collected.  A number of large stones stand upright in a circle in the center of the area, their surfaces covered with faint, incised sigils."
