    "The summit of the mountain is almost lost in a smothering mixture of low clouds and dense fog.  An occasional glimpse of the valley far below is afforded when the intermittent wind scatters the clouds and fog.  The shadowy entrance to a cave can be seen emerging from the rocks to the northeast."
