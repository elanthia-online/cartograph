    "The carved spirals of the ceiling, walls, and floor tighten inward as the cavern narrows in its ascent.  Assorted stalactites hang precariously from the ceiling with an exact mirrored stalagmite directly beneath each.  Floating between the pairings of stalagmites and stalactites are small ethereal balls of light."
