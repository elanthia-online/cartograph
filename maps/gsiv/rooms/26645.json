  "description": [
    "Thin rocky protrusions tower overhead like skeletal fingers, surfaces pitted and worn from relentless wind and wave.  Broad, flattened stones form a series of benches surrounding a massive basalt slab.  A makeshift stage sweeps back to the shore's edge. The flash of foaming waves can be glimpsed as water crashes against the sharp stones below.  A winding path among the jagged, stony formations leads to the east, ending at an abandoned lighthouse."
