  "description": [
    "The armory is strewn with debris, huge pieces of stone littering the floor as if an explosion had occurred.  Dust covers everything in a thick mantle, only giving way to a thin path.  It winds between the heaps of rock like a meandering creek.  Across the walls stretches a panorama, faded with time and almost obscured in the gloom, but breathtaking, nonetheless."
