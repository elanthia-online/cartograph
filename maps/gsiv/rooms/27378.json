    "Tents huddle closely about each other, leaning inward as if sharing trade secrets.  The gentle tink-tink-tink of a small hammer on metal rings through the area, echoing over the sounds of the village.  A blast of heat and the smell of burnt metal rises from one of the tents every time the breeze rises, but the open flap of the tent opposite it does seem inviting."
