  "description": [
    "Dyed a rich green hue, fleece pelts cover the floor from wall to wall and offer a soft, plush comfort beneath the steeply peaked roof.  Upon one side of the white-walled room is a luxurious feather bed covered with crisp white linens and a down comforter, while directly across stands a towering modwir armoire with painted doors.  At the foot of the bed rests a simple foot locker and several glowing glaesine globes dangle from the exposed rafters amid boughs of fresh and dried lavender."
