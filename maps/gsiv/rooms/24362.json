  "description": [
    "The small office is cozy and filled with maps and furnishing, but immaculately tidy.  Directly across the room from the door stands a large monir desk with papers, scrolls and various implements and ornaments all arranged neatly on its top.  A large fireplace dominates the wall to the right, the fire burning within providing plenty of light.  The walls are covered with maps, some depicting strange and faraway places, others very familiar areas."
