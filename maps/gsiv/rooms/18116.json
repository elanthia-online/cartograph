    "Rows of chairs cascade down to face a white seashell-shaped enclosure and the open sea beyond.  The half seashell stands as high as two giantmen and opens toward the audience, protectively housing a crimson marble dais.  Behind the dais, suspended from the seashell's roof, a huge banner moves gently in the wind.  Black sands radiate the day's accumulated sunlight to provide a soft, warm floor, and torches ringing the amphitheater burn brightly, providing more than adequate illumination.",
