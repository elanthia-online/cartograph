    "A silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls, and a low skylight-set ceiling rises overhead.  A colorful seashell collection sits in one corner of a glazed bamboo floor.  There is some carved haon pegs on one side of the shop and an oversized sea chest on the other."
