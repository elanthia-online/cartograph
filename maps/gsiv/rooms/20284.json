    "Fresh thatching fills the holes in the ceiling where the old hatching has rotted away, while newer wood in the walls keeps the wind and humidity from outside at bay.  A single lantern suspended from the ceiling provides dim illumination and outlines the shape of a fur-laden sleeping pallet in one corner and a tarnished copper mirror in the other.  Though still warped and creaking, the floorboards display signs of recent repairs."
