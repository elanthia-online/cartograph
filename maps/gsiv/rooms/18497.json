    "Here and there the thick green leaves are pulled away from the golden corn hiding inside.  Insects circle around the pale yellow treasure, buzzing quietly as they alight and then drift away on the warm, gentle breeze.  Broken corn husks sway in the wind, dangling limply from the places where they are still barely attached, and a small break in the maize wall leads to a field beyond."
