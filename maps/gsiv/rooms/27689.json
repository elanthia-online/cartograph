  "description": [
    "Plank driftwood flooring extends out in a wide expanse, broken only by several standing aquaria filled with blue water and several saltwater fish in varying hues, from vivid orange to deep violet.  Several exits reside in the white wood-paneled walls, an ovular black metal doorway to the east, a curved brown arch to the north, a pale tan-striped curtain to the west, and a pale driftwood hallway leading back to the salon.   An oversized window allows in the natural light from outside, illuminating the room with golden sunshine."
