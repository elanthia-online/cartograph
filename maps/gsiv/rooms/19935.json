    "Irregular slabs of tawny sandstone surround a small round pool sunken into the northeast corner of the room.  The ochre streaked floor easily holds the natural warmth seeping from the pool.  Candlelight flickers merrily from frosted glass sconces along the wall.  A simple cane-backed settee with scrolled arms and leather cushions occupies the southwest corner.  A cylindrical vase holding a bouquet of dried lavender sits on a small oval table near the settee."
