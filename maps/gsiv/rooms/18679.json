    "Two glass-paned cases square off, facing each other across the shop.  Their contents not withstanding, the room is almost entirely white -- whitewashed stone walls, a white tiled floor and a white marble-topped bar set in a recessed space along the back wall combine in a cool, clean aesthetic."
