    "A huge trophy hangs over the room's large oak-framed bed.  The sea thrak hangs from its board in a silent vigil, glass eyes staring unperturbed, as if there was something on the opposite wall the great beast might want to eat.  On the bed, soft green linens and a thick wool blanket provide a cozy place to rest."
