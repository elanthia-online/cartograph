    "A particularly large boulder rests in the soil.",
    "A particularly large boulder rests in the soil.  Wheat surrounds it on all sides, pressing up close to the boulder's granite sides.  Small tunnels extend underneath the boulder, leading away quickly into darkness.  The tunnels are no more than a few inches across, and small squeakings and chitterings emanate from the holes.  Occasionally a rustling sound comes from somewhere just out of sight in the wheat, but no creatures ever pop out of the holes."
