    "A large wooden palisade stands in the center of a forest glade encircled by a wall of greenery.  Shafts of sunlight cover the palisade and the large parade ground intersected by a dirt-worn path from the west.  A row of practice dummies lines one side of the grounds, the earth around them needled with numerous arrows sticking upwards in various directions.",
