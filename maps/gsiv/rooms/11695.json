  "description": [
    "Passing up and over an earthen barrier, a dirt road runs along the edge of the keep's outer wall toward a portcullis to the east.  The ground is barren but for lichens, mosses, and the occasional patch of brown marsh grass that appear over a layer of gravel spreading outward from the wall for many feet."
