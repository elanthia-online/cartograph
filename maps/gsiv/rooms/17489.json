  "description": [
    "Dark purple carpeting patterned with vines and leaves in gold spreads from wall to wall.  Piles of tasseled pillows are placed near the fireplace.  Opaque lilac netting drapes elegantly from the top of the canopy bed and is tied back with a white, braided cord to display the mulberry-colored leaf-embroidered coverlet.  Soft pools of light emanate from the tinted globes of oil lamps and reflect off the polished surfaces of matching end tables that flank the bed, enhancing the cozy atmosphere of the bedchamber."
