    "Polished rails of golden linden ring the balcony and follow the length of the catwalk as it traverses the open air towards a large tree.  Trailing honeysuckle vines, their delicate white blooms perfuming the air, decorate the walls of the inn and create delicate wreaths over the magnolia-etched and glass-paned doors."
