    "Embedded in the floor are crushed mermaid's-tear sapphires, laid to form the image of a boot with a large buckle within a circle of star-of-Tamzyrr diamonds.  Pushed against the walls are several work tables, which take up a considerable amount of space in the room.  Small pieces of metal and scraps of leather litter the ground surrounding a short glaes-bound barrel, its lid discarded beneath a free-standing tool rack in the center of the room.  Larger than the others, this workshop can accommodate several people."
