    "A mixture of sand, pebbles and small rocks underfoot is still warm from the earlier sun of the day, counteracting a stiff, cool breeze from the Bay.  The beach runs to the river, the bank to the north having slowly disappeared leaving small eddying pools at the waters edge.  Across the widening river, a large rocky field is visible, ending at a high cliff far to the north.",
