    "Swallows dip and wheel around a deep cleft in the cliff face, some of them bearing bits of grass and vines to be used for nests.  The wildflowers that carpet the clearing are in full bloom, their brilliant yellows and purples a welcome change from the starkness of the pale grey cliff face to the north.",
    "Bats flutter around the night-blooming plants at the base of the cliff, drawn there by drifts of insects which swarm around the sweet-smelling blossoms.  Denser foliage to the south obscures the more distant trees, but seems passable if potentially treacherous at night.  A deep cleft in the cliff face is a blacker shadow against the dark grey stone."
