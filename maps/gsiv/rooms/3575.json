    "Stepping into the small stone shrine, you are amazed as neither dust nor dirt nor any of the overgrowth that kept it hidden from outside is present.  Echoing the loud hum outside, the walls hum with the flow of ancient power.  There is a small opening set above a stone altar, but otherwise the shrine is empty."
