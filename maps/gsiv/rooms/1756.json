  "description": [
    "A river flows out of the lake, moving eastward before disappearing underneath one of the mountains.  It is difficult to see exactly where it drains, though, because the surface ices over before it actually reaches the mountainside.  Although iced, the river's surface does not feel thick enough to allow travel to the north.  The conifer forest follows the lakeshore and the river's bank all the way to the mountains, providing a green strip in the midst of the valley's barren scenery."
