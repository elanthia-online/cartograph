    "The table wobbles a bit here, sloshing the drinks set down upon it.  Someone thoughtfully tried to even it up by placing a broken dagger blade beneath one of the table legs.  The table surface is darkened with age and spilled ale, but the painting of a thrak can still be seen:  it is sitting on its rump, a flagon of ale in hand and balanced upon its comical pot-belly, with stars and birds flying about its head."
