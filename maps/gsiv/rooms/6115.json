    "Jagged rocks protrude from the floor as wisps of steam dance in the swirling air.  The cold night air causes the steam to crystallize, making the air shimmer with dancing sparkles as the ice reflects the silvery night sky.  The floor is pitted and cracked and extremely hot causing the water dripping off the southern wall to hiss as it evaporates on impact.  The sounds of hissing steam overwhelm all others and deafen the echoes present in the rest of the canyon.",

The sound of hissing steam overwhelms all others and deafens the echoes present in the rest of the canyon.  To the east the junction of the canyons can be seen at the base of a collapsed canyon wall while to the west, a tree can be seen growing on a ledge, high on the western wall."
