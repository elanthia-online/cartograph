    "A few homesteads dot the inclines surrounding the snow-covered meadow.  The owners joined in the fun, creating ice sculptures in their yards and snow creatures on the rooftops.  Very little wind gets over the rise, keeping the artworks in good shape until they are taken down by someone to make room for a new creation."
