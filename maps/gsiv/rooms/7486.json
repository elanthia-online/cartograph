    "The gargantuan stairway rises from the landing here, reaching up along the wall of the cavern farther than you can see.  The stair is a marvel, an engineering feat of unparalleled proportions.  The broad steps are more than twenty feet wide, some seven or eight feet deep, and about three feet high."
