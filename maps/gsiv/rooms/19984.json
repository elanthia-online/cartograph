    "The walls here are painted a deep maroon hue that contrasts markedly with the white baseboards and ceiling.  In one corner, a mannequin stands in a cylindrical glass display while in the opposite corner, a long glass case holds several ancient weapons.  Hanging on the wall in between the two displays is a panoramic painting on an extra long canvas, framed in burled oak.  The opposite wall is blank save for three, evenly spaced oil lanterns dangling from black iron hooks."
