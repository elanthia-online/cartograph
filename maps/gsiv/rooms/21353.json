  "description": [
    "The warmth of this chamber welcomes you, as the room is engulfed by the sun reaching through the intricately carved openings in the bark walls.  In one corner, a four-posted bed draped with a cockatrice feather comforter invites you to bask in the tranquility of your surroundings.  Below a painting on the opposite wall is an oak desk, covered with scrolls, colorful drawings and maps.  A rug covers the floor near a fireplace in the adjacent corner.",
