    "A deep trough here seems to be the remains of an attempt to tunnel into the castle from the outside which has long since collapsed into itself.  A section of the outer wall seems to have been destroyed in the collapse, but the northwest tower of the inner keep seems quite undamaged.  To the west of here lies the northwest guardtower."
