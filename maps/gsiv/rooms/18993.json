    "Storage space has been bored out of the stone walls, and various nooks have been fitted with iron-braced shelving.  A goodly number of supplies stock the shelves, replenished by the assistants that regularly pass through.  In one particular corner, a sturdy invar cabinet stands beside a few empty crates."
