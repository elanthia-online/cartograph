  "description": [
    "Ocean blue walls surround this small room that is little more than a spacious closet.  Leaning up against one wall, a small table stands beside a curved ocean blue doorway that leads out of the room.  Nearby, a young attendant stands ready to serve.  The focal point of the room is a swirling seafoam white portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Seashells of many varieties have been etched into the metal, each one overlapping another to form a pattern reminiscent of the scales of a fish."
