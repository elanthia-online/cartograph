    "Polished green and black marble walls enclose this spacious room.  Sharply arched windows open up to the lush greenery outside and allow a fragrant island breeze to freshen the air within the shop.  Glass display cases rest on the cool green marble floor at sporadic intervals, while pewter oil lamps hang on the walls between the windows.  Taking up residence at the back of the room is a large bamboo lacquered counter."
