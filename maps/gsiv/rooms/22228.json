    "Gold-veined ebon marble covers the countertops and a large island workspace that dominates the center of the room.  Ceramic crocks of all shapes and sizes overflow with fresh ingredients, exotic scents mingling with the tropical air that drifts through a pair of large windows.  A dark brick fireplace fills one wall, with several smaller ovens built into the side for baking.  Various utensils hang from steel hooks, their surfaces brightly polished.  A teak and bamboo dry sink stands open, its shelves filled with a variety of foods."
