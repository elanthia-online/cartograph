    "This is the main gambling den of the hall.  The air is rife with the perspiration of nervous intensity.  The lack of distractions indicates this is the domain of serious gamblers.  A dice table, some card tables and a gaming table have players and kibbitzers clustered around them.  Looking about, you try to sort out the winners and losers.  The cry of a hawker and excited shouts from players can be heard from beyond a narrow arch on the far side of room."
