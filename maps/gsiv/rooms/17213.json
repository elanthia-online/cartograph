    "A lone sconce sheds minimal light about the chamber.  The room appears mostly bare, though in the darkness, it is difficult to discern much of anything.  Curious, zapping noises emanate from a tank on a not-too-distant corner, followed closely by flashes of light.  A small set of shelves resides near the stairwell leading upward and out of the darkness."
