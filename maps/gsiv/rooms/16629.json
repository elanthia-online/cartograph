    "A painted native mask hangs on one of the smooth mistwood walls, and a sturdy bamboo-rafter ceiling rises overhead.  A set of terra cotta jugs sits in one corner of a glazed bamboo floor.  There is a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on one side of the shop and a long mistwood counter on the other."
