    "Arranged off to the east side of the great foyer, leather sofas sit upon plush ornate carpets in varying patterns.  Plump silk pillows are tossed on the floor around a low blackwood table, the setting overshadowed by towering bookshelves crammed full of old texts, thick volumes, and odd mechanical contraptions."
