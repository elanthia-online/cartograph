  "description": [
    "Polished ebonwood floors softly glow beneath a rich wine-and-black antique silk rug centered in the open room.  In one corner stands a large black walnut four-poster bed, regally draped in deep wine-hued velvet.  Black obsidian hexagonal tables flank each side of the bed and match a nearby ornately carved armoire.  An elegant tapestry hangs above a large fireplace while a writing desk separates tall velvet-draped windows."
