    "A broad wooden walkway leads north to a canopied platform.  A counter and attendant occupy the center of the platform, and a number of narrower walkways radiate from it to other platforms, each supporting a small, tin-roofed building with a brick chimney.  To either side of the gatehouse to the south, the roofs and upper stories of Marshtown's taller buildings can be seen above the enclave's high fence."
