    "Transitioning from lilac to indigo and all the hues in between, the painted walls rise from the cool white marble floor tiles and disappear into the star-spangled darkness of the ebon ceiling above.  White-swaddled chairs are arranged around a glass and wrought iron table near a set of double doors fitted with painted glass panes, while a lace-draped featherbed occupies a nearby wall."
