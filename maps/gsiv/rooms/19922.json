    "Thick stone walls embrace the windowless room with a small steel door and an imflass door offering exits.  Beneath its vaulted, copper ceiling is a wide rack with well-ordered weapons arrayed along both sides.  Sets of armor and siege machine parts are neatly stacked on oak shelves against the eastern wall.  Well-polished shields hang from hooks on the western wall with each gleaming brightly in the light filtering through the small portals leading to the Great Hall."
