    "You look down into one of the pools and are momentarily startled to see a huge crayfish staring back at you with glossy black eyes.  The other pool is filled with plantlife and holds a small, spring-fed fountain.  This is the source of the water for the other tanks as the overflow from this one keeps the rest filled."
