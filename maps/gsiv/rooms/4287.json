    "An arched bridge spans the avenue.  Halflings crossing overhead stop occasionally to peer down over the rail in curiosity.  The underside of the bridge is decorated with a painted mural depicting a festival of some sort, celebrated with a bountiful feast.  Halflings munch cheerfully on all sorts of roasted meats and pastries.  Houses crowd next to the bridge's elegantly carved pilings, lending charm to the bridge's belly."
