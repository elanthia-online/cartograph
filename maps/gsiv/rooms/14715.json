    "Several large sows wallow happily in the muck and filth, secure within the sturdy fence of oak slats that keeps out predators and poachers alike.  The pen sits flush against the wall of the tavern, and while getting thrown through the window above might get you in, none of the sows looks up to tossing you back out.  The solid mistwood door is bolted from the outside and some semi-literate swineherd has managed to carve \"Haus uv Lords\" above."
