    "Panels of deep sapphire blue silk fall in soft folds across each oak-framed wall.  A pair of lanterns suspended from faenor chains illuminates the spacious interior.  Blanketing the floor is a soft alabaster woolen carpet woven with a sapphire rose pattern.  A small mistwood sign hangs from a central support."
