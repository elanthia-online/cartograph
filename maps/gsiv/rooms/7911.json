    "Enclosed behind heavy, rectangular glass display cases standing atop identical white marble pedestals are ancient sets of brigandine, hauberk, augmented breastplate, and full plate armor.  Speckled marble columns reaching from floor to ceiling divide the room in half, separating the glass casements.  Thick braided rope strung between metal poles, keep the overly curious from venturing too closely to the exhibits.",
    "Sunlight pours through the half-dozen stained glaes windows, casting a reddish tint over the entire room.  Enclosed behind heavy, rectangular glass display cases standing atop identical white marble pedestals are ancient sets of brigandine, hauberk, augmented breastplate, and full plate armor.  Speckled marble columns reaching from floor to ceiling divide the room in half, separating the glass casements.  Thick braided rope strung between metal poles, keep the overly curious from venturing near the exhibits."
