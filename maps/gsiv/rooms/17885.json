    "Towering oak and maoral trees line a verdant path, their leafy boughs casting deep shadows across the mossy ground.  A single stone bench, the grey stone tinged green from the verdant plant growth, is nestled into a tiny hollow beside the path.  Opposite the hollow is a white marble statue surrounded by a bed of crimson dragonstalks."
