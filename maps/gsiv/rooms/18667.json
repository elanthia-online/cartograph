    "Icy walls, veined with traces of silver and gold, flow seamlessly from the entry of the training annex into the alchemy wing.  The walls have been caught at the moment of melt when the formation of water droplets causes a mirror-bright sheen to coat the ice.  Oddly, despite their liquid appearance, the walls are dry to the touch."
