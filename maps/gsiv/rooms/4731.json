    "Trampled flat by the passage of small denizens of the forest, the animal run skirts its way around stout oak trunks and moss-covered stones, disappearing into the shadows.  A strong, earthy scent rises from the thick layers of ground cover and mixes with the wild odor of the ancient oak trees.  A canopy of overgrown oak branches bathes the area in shadow.",
