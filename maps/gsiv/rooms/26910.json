  "description": [
    "The energy of the cavern echoes off the walls as patrons are camouflaged under a thick haze of hazelnut cigar smoke.  Sanguine leather bar stools line a sturdy ebonwood bar that curves outward to provide ample room behind the bar for shelves of various liquor from across Elanthia.  The expansive floor plan opens up to reveal a dart board, which receives the only splash of light in the grotto.  A dimly lit inlet in the rock houses a series of sleek cream leather booths creating an intimate atmosphere."
