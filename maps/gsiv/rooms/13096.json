    "Dark smudges blacken the upper portion of the round room's walls and obscure the ceiling in hazy soot that is broken only by the presence of heavy chains that support enormous torches.  Beneath the flickering torchlight, the room is militaristically tidy and filled with battle maps, planning tables, and detailed job charts.  A steady flow of foot traffic at all times of the day rushes to and from the eastern arch."
