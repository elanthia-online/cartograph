    "A long wooden table encompasses much of the far wall, its surface covered with sawdust, wood shavings, and a small metal tray with a yellow tag.  The smell of wood smoke lingers here, as if some burning had taken place.  Dozens of pegs dot the wall above the table, each one home to a tool of the trade.  Resting beside the narrow wooden door leading out is a large metal crate filled with spare lumber."
