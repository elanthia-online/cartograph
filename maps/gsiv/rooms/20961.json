    "The rushing water of the nearby stream is rhythmic and soothing as the water navigates through the forest.  Poking up through the water are several large stepping stones that can be used to pass across the stream.  Overhead, the foliage is thick and lush, the vibrant green leaves interspersed with dangling vines and branches."
