    "Accompanied by a pair of black oak trees, a well-crafted oaken figure rises up from the flowering undergrowth.  Carved into the life-sized image of an elven huntress, the figure holds an ornate longbow between its hands, an arrow notched at the ready.  A look of grim determination crosses the otherwise delicate feminine face, and a suit of hunting leathers has been meticulously engraved into the fine wood."
