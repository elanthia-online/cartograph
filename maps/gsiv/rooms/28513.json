    "[Underground, Sacrificial Altar]"

  "description": [
    "The rough dimensions of this chamber suggest it was formed by some manner of calamity, with its rocky floor spanning only two-thirds of the depth from one wall to another before dropping off into a sheer chasm that echoes with the flow of water from somewhere below.  Near the edge is an elaborate altar of stone and ghezyte, and before it stands a raised stone slab and an imposing crossed timber rack, the stone around each stained ruddy and dark.  At the rear of the chamber is a heavily warded doorway that leads up a set of steps, and on the far end, imbedded in the wall, is a discolored section of stone."
