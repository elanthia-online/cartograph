    "A small path reveals a rather unkempt stone building sitting far back from the road, its roof in a state of disrepair.  The building is a rather stark contrast to the otherwise rich farmland that surrounds it.  One window appears to have been broken at some distant time past, and has been patched with a piece of dirty oilcloth.  A metal sign hangs beside the front door, through which a few patrons wander."
