    "[A Slipshod Building]"

  "description": [
    "The ramshackled building is visibly leaning too far to the right, its oaken walls drastically slanting in a precarious manner.  A clattering of loose planks dangles around wide breaches that are punched along the unstable ceiling above, the openings splashing streams of sunlight onto the crooked flooring.  Amid the clutter of cobwebs and dust, an unfinished dark pine cabinet sits next to a dented walnut and elm chest."
