    "A glaesine-topped oak workbench dominates the cramped laboratory, one end pushed against the wall so it is beneath a hexagonal window.  Atop the window-side of the workbench rests a complicated, silver gem lens assembly.  A glass alembic and a moon-carved, grey marble crucible also congregate upon the workbench.  Scorch marks mar the white marble floors, and a curtained arch leads northwest to the main hallway.  A tiny, potted sunflower, blooms closed for the night, sits in the lone, unscorched corner.",
