  "description": [
    "A precise arrangement of chairs rings a long oval table in the center of this airy room.  The chairs are facing outward, however, so that prospective customers can try out each one.  A small child plays on a red velvet chair, her half eaten piece of chocolate coming into dangerously close range of its elegant gold trim.  In one corner, a harried mother gesticulates and a plump sales clerk politely pays attention while keeping one nervous eye on his threatened chair."
