    "Dank and dark do not begin to describe the omnipresent ambiance of gloom in this fetid space.  Small mud puddles along the periphery merge with larger ones sunken in the center, leaving little room for navigating safely around the boot-sucking moisture that threatens glisteningly underfoot.  What light reflects off the muddy surfaces comes only from a few scattered torches mounted within iron brackets imbedded in the carved grey stone walls."
