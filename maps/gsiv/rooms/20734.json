    "Highly polished wood floors are covered with woven wool rugs, providing splashes of color in the large, chandelier-lit foyer.  A burled maple doorway resides in the eastern wall, and a sweeping grand staircase leads to the second floor.  In the opposite corner, a dimly lit hallway leads to the interior of the lodge.  Several burnished leather sofas and chairs, facing a low stone hearth, invite rest, while a a wide gold-chased table is placed between them.  Beside the entry doors a small golden depository sits against the darkly paneled wall."
