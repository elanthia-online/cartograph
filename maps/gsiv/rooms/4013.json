  "description": [
    "An enormous black iron door, its face carved with labyrinthine whorls and bas-relief tunnels, stands as a formidable guard to the world beyond the cavern.  A series of wide bronze braziers, each one set equidistant from its neighbor, lines the long corridor, the brightly glowing coals casting shadows on the distant ceiling.  Painted onto the smooth walls are a series of bright blue, azure, and white murals."
