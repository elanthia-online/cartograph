  "description": [
    "Brick and wood homes have been built on the eastern side of the road, turned to face the large meadow that rests to the north of them.  Several large barrels of apples line the fence, although large insects and worms can be seen skittering and wriggling about around them.  The road here is paved with the cracked and shattered remnants of smooth stones."
