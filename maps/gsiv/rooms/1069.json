    "The trail follows the sheer cliff face to the west and southeast.  Extending up through the fog until it is lost from sight, the smooth basalt wall of the cliff displays no handholds for use in ascending.  Its surface undulates slightly as if it had been cast in molten form, the hot rock waving back and forth, before solidifying into place.  The thick grass ends just short of the cliff, allowing relatively dry and unimpeded movement in both directions."
