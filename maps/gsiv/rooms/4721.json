    "A building of some sort nestles in a clearing in the valley below.  There appears to be a safe and rather easily traveled way down the ridgeline to the clearing, as if people tend to visit the area rather often.  The cobblestone road sweeps north, disappearing eventually into the forest, and west, following the ridgeline.  The forest has retreated from the ridgeline's edge here, and the road is bathed brightly in sunlight.",
