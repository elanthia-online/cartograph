    "To one side, the trees start to thin out, offering a dark silhouette of the island shoreline, and a moonlit-sparkling creek that runs out to meet the riverway.  Opposite, the grove of old growth thickens, blocking out much of the pale light and leaving only a formation shadowy trunks.",
    "To one side, the trees start to thin out, offering a view of the island shoreline and a small creek that runs out to meet the riverway.  Sunlight is plentiful here, streaming through the trees in sliced beams cut by the leafy canopy, and a peaceful silence is only broken by the odd bird call or breaking twig.  Opposite, the grove of old growth thickens, blocking out much of the golden rays while inviting with its cool shelter."
