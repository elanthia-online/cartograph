  "description": [
    "Sweltering heat emanates from the crimson forge in the corner of the room.  Two wide windows stand open over the forge in an unsuccessful attempt to cool the room.  A large bellows sits beside the forge, ready to fan the red hot coals even brighter.  Sitting in the center of the room is a massive iron anvil with a water trough beside it.  Various hammers and other tools hang from wooden pegs lining the walls."
