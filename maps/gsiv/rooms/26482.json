    "In rustic display, water-darkened beams brace the ceiling, and a brass-framed lamp dangles at each joint.  A crossed pair of ancient eel spears are mounted overhead, anchored against a backdrop of fishing nets draped in shallow swathes from the beams.  Underfoot, golden oak planks, buffed and highly polished, traverse the length of the tavern and reflect the illumination of the lamps in a gilded haze."
