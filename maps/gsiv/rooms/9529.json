    "The flickering light cast by the fireflies reflects off something metallic near the west wall.  A metal breastplate, badly corroded but in one piece, rests mostly buried in the jumbled bones.  Its straps are wrapped around several of the larger bones, which are, in turn, entwined with other bones.  The straps are strong enough, and the weight of the bones heavy enough, that the breastplate refuses to budge.  Even if it could be freed, it is in such bad shape that it would be worthless."
