  "description": [
    "Creating a narrow lane of passage, the waterway stretches beyond a series of blown glass globes toward the distant beach on the north side and crashes against the rough rocks of an island to the south.  Swimmers playfully splash in the waters on the other side of the floating orbs, some waving to the boaters, and others riding the waves back to land."
