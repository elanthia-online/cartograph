    "Smooth grey stone walls surround the area, harboring several woven wool tapestries that impart their warm, neutral tones to the quaint simplicity of the shop.  A maoral plank floor spreads out to each corner of the room, its surface plain but polished to a deep luster.  A pair of bronze sconces hold candles that cast their wavering light along a dark fel bookcase, its polished spires nearly reaching the top of the maoral beam ceiling.  A linen-covered dark fel table stands near the northern edge of the room, placed beneath a series of low fel shelves."
