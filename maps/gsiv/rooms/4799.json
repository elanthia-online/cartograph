    "The forest floor slopes up and a large number of coniferous trees are scattered among the growth.  Some trees are leaning, some have recently fallen over, and many are decomposing on the ground.  A hemlock has grown through a crack in a large boulder that was probably left here by glacial action during the last ice age."
