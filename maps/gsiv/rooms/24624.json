  "description": [
    "Sunlight glimmers across the wide expanse of fragrant green grass.  Beds thick with flowers line the perimeter of the area, creating a haven for the bees and butterflies who feast among the colorful blossoms.",
    "Moonlight shimmers across the wide expanse of the meadow, touching each blade of grass with a silvery sheen.  A large area of the grass has been sectioned off for dancing.  Hundreds of tiny glaesine-cupped candles, stationed upon slender ironwork poles, are scattered through the flowerbeds and around the trees that surround the meadow, providing the effect of a thousand fireflies dancing in the night air.  Opalescent silvery ribbons drift from the trees."
