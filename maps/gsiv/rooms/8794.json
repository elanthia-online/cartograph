    "A flagstone terrace is ringed with tall trees and beds of flowers, each competing to outshine the others with an abundance of blooms.  The walk meanders, from the tall wall with its inset gate, to a shingle-clad cottage.  The dwelling is settled into its array of gardens like a jewel, the trees overhead dappling its curved roofline with shade and keeping the interior cool and comfortable.  A deep violet door opens into the cottage."
