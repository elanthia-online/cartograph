    "Crossing a north-south ridge, the road rises to provide a glimpse of what lies ahead and behind.  To the west, the road dips slightly between this ridge and the next.  To the east, the road dips lower and disappears beneath a blanket of cloud.  Beyond it the roadway re-emerges, a faint string of grey in the distance."
