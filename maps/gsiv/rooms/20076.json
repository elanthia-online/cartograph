    "The heavily wooded path begins to thin out some, allowing moonlight to pour in from the sky above.  To the northeast, an enormous weeping willow reaches to the sky, its long branches draping creeping foliage down to the ground.  To the northwest, the forest thickens, causing the area to be masked in vegetation.",
