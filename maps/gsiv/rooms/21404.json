    "Discarded food wrappers mingle with the muddy underbrush that flanks the narrow oak-planked passage.  Hawkers and hucksters can be heard, their distant cries of wares and games echoing off of the stagnant pools of water that flank the walkway.  Crickets and cicadas add their own chorus to that of the bipeds, the odd buzzing a strange counterpoint to the atmosphere of the midway."
