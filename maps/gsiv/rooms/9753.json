    "The outcropping of wood comprising the incline levels off at the foot of a large tapestry covering the wall.  It appears to be woven of silk, and the vibrant colors used in its panoramic composition glow in jewel-like tones in the hazy light.  To the southeast, the incline continues to follow the bend of the tree's inner walls as it rises into the giant's dizzy heights."
