    "The broad sweep of the black marble floor is interrupted by a bronzed drake sculpture.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the mottled grey marble walls.  An engraved copper bin and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop.",
    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a suit of silver-chased armor.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls.  Some wrought-iron hooks and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
