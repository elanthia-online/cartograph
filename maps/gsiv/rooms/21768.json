  "description": [
    "The furnishings in this chamber look comfortable and oft used.  On the east wall, a cozy fireplace beckons you to be seated on the comfortable chair in front of it.  A large bookcase and desk occupy one corner of the room, while a bed fills another.  The oak panelled walls are bare save for a broken staff hanging over the fireplace and white lace curtains around the room's window."
