    "A large cavern is cut into the hill, its floor and ceiling crafted of smooth rock with a pronounced pattern of striations.  Fanciful trees fashioned from the same gorgeous stone sit in monumental urns around the perimeter, each leaf carved in minute detail.  A generous round oak door on the cavern's west wall is surmounted by a sign reading simply 'Tavern', and the noise of revelry emerges from behind it."
