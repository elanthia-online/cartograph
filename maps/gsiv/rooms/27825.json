  "description": [
    "Deep blue silk drapes the north and east walls of the small chamber, but the curving wall that sweeps from west to south is filled with arched windows open to the sea air.  Sunlight bathes the spiraled blue-and-gold oak parquet floor with warmth.  A pair of narrow tapestries flank the door to the north, while the east wall is given over to a glass-fronted cabinet full of sheet music.  A few spindly chairs of brass and wood are tucked into the corners of the room."
