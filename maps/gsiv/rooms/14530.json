    "A towering palm-like tree sits in the center of the path, its side marked by a narrow, scarred slit near the top.  An attentive banana-crested hornbill darts about the area, completely consumed by a search for food.  The large bird stalks through the grass and soars low to the ground, scooping up whatever it can find that may be edible."
