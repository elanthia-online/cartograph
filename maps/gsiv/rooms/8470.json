    "A gust of moisture-heavy wind buffets you, nearly knocking you off the ledge you stand on.  Set back on the rock shelf is what appears to be a ruined temple.  The remnants of colored glass hang in the windows, and the doorway is empty.  A warped and faded wooden sign lies on the ground before the building, set at an odd angle that suggests it was ripped from the face of the structure.",

The remnants of colored glass hang in the windows, visible only during the fitful flashes of lightning, and the doorway is empty.  A warped and faded wooden sign lies on the ground before the building, set at an odd angle that suggests it was ripped from the face of the structure."
