    "Rising up from a pale marble floor speckled with flecks of glittering mica, two forest green walls flank this portion of the hallway.  Hanging between several flickering torches are a detailed rubbed charcoal sketch, a large teak-framed painting, and an inverted mithril tower shield.  Centrally located on the cool floor is an expansive abstract sculpture made of pure kelyn."
