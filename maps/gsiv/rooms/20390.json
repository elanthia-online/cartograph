  "description": [
    "Lengths of heavy amethyst velvet hang down from the ceiling in this part of the pavilion, draping nearly to the floor.  Attached to the ebonwood supports, small frosted glass globes provide a soft glowing illumination, drawing attention to the wares pinned to the swathes of fabric.  A few stray buttons are scattered on the ground, long ago discarded underfoot."
