    "An industrious sort has tried to repair the badly damaged road by replacing a few of the busted planks with halved logs, but based on the way they are bobbing in the rippling current of the swamp, it might not have been such a good idea.  Nearby trees look to be serving as neighborhood pantries, as the carcasses of several small critters can be seen hanging from the branches."
