    "Waves of scorching heat distort the air into a vicious blur, and the hall is soaked with an angry crimson glow from the surrounding lava.  Standing at the edge of the small island which keeps you safe from the magma's reach is a white marble statue of a man with solid black eyes, and scimitar in hand.  Curiously, no altar sits before the statue, only a jagged steel greatsword pointed back toward the way you came.  Marked in bold letters upon the floor above the massive sword's hilt is an inscription."
