    "The clangs, bangs and cursing from this construction site drown out the din from the rest of the town.  You can't yet tell what the dwarves are building.  For now, it's just a huge hole in the ground surrounded by big piles of rocks.  One massive boulder is tied up with stout ropes, extending to a pulley on a beam erected overhead.  Two dwarves stand on each side of the rock, yelling, stamping their feet, and waving sheafs of parchment over their heads."
