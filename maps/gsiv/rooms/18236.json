    "Gently lapping at the docks, the waters of the harbor occasionally splash up onto the smooth expanse.  Bright white buoys set at even intervals protect the pier from any damage that may occur during the ferry's docking process, while the opposite corner houses a series of benches that have been built against the railing.  A colorful awning of grey-whorled purple stretches over one corner and provides shelter from the elements."
