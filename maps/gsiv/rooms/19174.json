  "description": [
    "A gleaming crystal chandelier set with dozens of tiny candles brightens this windowless room, casting dancing beams of light over a wide array of metallic and gem-crusted wares.  A long silver display table is flanked by a twisted wire tree and a skinny modwir cloak rack.  The smooth plank floors are partially covered by a fluffy pink sheepskin rug scattered with a few turquoise silk pillows."
