  "description": [
    "The room is dominated by a battered trestle table set haphazardly with an assortment of good quality but mismatched silver and tableware.  The table cloth is covered with gravy stains and scraps of rotted meat, and splotches of potatoes mar the walls and floor, perhaps remnants of previous meals or food fights.  Off to one side sits a water-stained wooden seachest beside a stained maple sideboard."
