    "A single, flickering lantern provides a gloomy light that dances off the rusty broken cell doors lining the dark stone walls.  The air is warm and uncomfortably moist in this cramped chamber.  A fetid stink of rotting garbage, soiled disregarded clothing and worse assaults you like a slap in the face."
