    "Shelves upon shelves round the walls of this roughly circular room, each tighly packed to near overflowing with bottles and jars of various size and shape.  The center of the room is filled with an expansive worktable bearing a number of mortar and pestle sets, among other equipment.  A curved archway with a thick carven oak door interrupts the otherwise endless shelving and offers a means of exit."
