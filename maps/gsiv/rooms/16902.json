    "A badly lit cubbyhole serves as an office for the Zul Logoth registrar.  A lone toadstool situated in one corner appears to be badly malnourished and gives off a weak light.  Papers are strewn across a metal desk in the center of the room, and more papers protrude from the half-closed drawers of several cabinets against the back wall.  With space occupied by the toadstool pot, the desk, and the cabinets, there is barely enough room for the overweight dwarven registrar to sit behind the desk."
