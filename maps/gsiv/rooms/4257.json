    "While large trees line the ledge, the view below is inspiring, the verdant green spreading northwards towards the sea.  To the east a path leads through the forest towards an opening in the trees.  Along the ledge you see a series of steps that appear to have been carved into the face of the rock.  A breeze from the ocean reaches here, bringing a faint smell of saltwater to mix with the odor of the forest."
