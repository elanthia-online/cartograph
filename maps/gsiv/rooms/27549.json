  "description": [
    "Tunnels formed of strangler figs provide egress from this section of the slope towards the upper reaches, the plants' intertwining pale brown limbs bright in the darkened jungle.  Pools of stagnant water collect where the ground becomes level, while curtains of moss cling to splintered arboreal giants that are dark with decay and reek of dead fish.  Creepers wend their way over the black sand and through the puddles as they crisscross back and forth before disappearing deeper into the verdant landscape."
