    "Small rocks and pebbles litter the ground and patches of white mushrooms grow haphazardly alongside the gnarled roots of a twisted and bent tree growing near a weathered stone turret.  Etchings in the cobblestones have been worn thin over the years.  Off in the distance, a lone bird sings a sad melodic tune."
