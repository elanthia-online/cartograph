    "Beside a mighty fallen log lies a rock-laden rivulet solidified into glassy ice that has expanded across the footpath, making it extremely slick.  Nearby, leafy verdant bushes clump together and bend under the weight of thick snow.  Each is colorfully dotted with clusters of lush berries that thrive in winter."
