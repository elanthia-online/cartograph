  "description": [
    "The walls of the ravine rise high on either side, wrapping the trail in constant shadow except for high noon.  Close to sea level, the dampness and odor of the tidal marsh are carried into the ravine by the onshore breeze, while cattails fill the ditches to either side of the trail."
