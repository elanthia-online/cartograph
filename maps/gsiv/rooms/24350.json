    "The carpet is dyed black with trace amounts of indigo coloring.  Swaths of black fabric line the walls, affixed to the ceiling by black iron rods.  A single blackened steel chandelier hangs just above a platform in the center of the area.  A single strip of black carpet shaped like an arrow points to the door leading back out."
