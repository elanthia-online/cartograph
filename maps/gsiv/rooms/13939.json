    "Knee-high knot gardens line the flint pebbled walkway to a long, low building with tall windows that glint in the starlight.  Terraces of grapes, their vines tethered to thin wires, climb up the hillside, while small mounds of artemisia and lavender march in perfect symmetry to the edge of the lower terrace.  A wrought iron bench, its back made of woven birch branches, sits perpendicular to the building, allowing those who rest to admire the river vista of the lower escarpment and village spread below.",
