    "Nothing stirs on the plateau--not an insect, or rodent, or any living form.  Nothing creeps or crawls.  Nothing flies or buzzes.  The grey basalt stretches for miles, unbroken in color by anything green.  The absence of soil, anything smaller than a pebble long ago whisked away by the wind, and lack of rainfall combine to make this an inhospitable land for flora as well.  Only the wind exists here, and to listen to it, it's not very happy about being here, either."
