    "A steaming mithril fountain bubbles happily in the middle of the square, heated by thermal waters from deep within the earth.  Playful sprite statues throw water from buckets, the liquid arcing into the air and then falling into the confines of the basin with a noisy splash.  Animals wander in from time to time to soak in the heat before returning to the hostile weather of the Trace."
