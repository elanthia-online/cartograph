    "The well-worn path runs between the makeshift wall of broken trees and brush and a number of ramshackle huts.  A pile of discarded clothes sits beneath a rack with an unidentifiable skin stretched taunt for drying.  A break in the huts reveals the warcamp center directly to the east, while the worn path continues to the northeast and southeast.  The aroma of cooked flesh floats in from the west."
