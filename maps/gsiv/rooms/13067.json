    "Emerging from the stone chimney, the view of the Locksmehr River valley below is spectacular.  To the east, the town of Wehnimer's Landing is clearly visible, as are the sparkling waters of Darkstone Bay.  Off to the north, one can see how the forest gives way to the coastal cliffs and black sands.  Movement here is severely limited, with the only real choices being back down the stairs or across the jagged chasm to the west via a narrow rope and wood suspension bridge."
