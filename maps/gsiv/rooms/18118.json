    "Two ships lock in close combat, grappling lines tangled in each other's rigging.  Krolvin warriors leap from the right hand warship's deck to engage the defenders in the huge ship on the left.  Blood flows freely as the fight seesaws back and forth, neither side gaining advantage.  The ships yaw slightly in the rough seas, and black clouds gather ominously on the horizon.  Despite the pitched battle, no senses other than sight seem to function."
