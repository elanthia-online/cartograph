  "description": [
    "Crimson curtains with pure white trim cover portions of the ice walls in this wing dedicated to the end of the Ice Giant War, simultaneously symbolizing both the snow and the peace that came after the conflict.  A prodigious onyx wolf's head placed high on the rear wall guards a low steel limb-cleaver just below it, with a gleaming bronze statue of two embattled figures standing off-center just a few feet away so as not to impede the view of this display of sacrifice, this stain on Icemulian history."
