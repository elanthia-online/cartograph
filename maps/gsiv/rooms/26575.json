    "Polished volcanic granules from ancient lava deposits mix with the softer grey of basalt to create this slightly tonal beach.  Moon and starlight bring out the subtle sheen of the black sand, especially when damp from the tide and continual wash of waves.  The flames from rag-wrapped torches set into iron holds lining the berm crest add a fiery glimmer reflecting brightly.",

Polished volcanic granules from ancient lava deposits mix with the softer grey of basalt to create this slightly tonal beach.  Tiny flecks of green from peridot and red from iron ore add depth to the hue."
