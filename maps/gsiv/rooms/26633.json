    "The familiar texture of tent canvas covers the walls in this portion of the building, complete with a central tent pole and canvas roof to hide whatever ceiling exists.  A polished brass lantern hung from the pole fills the faux pavilion's interior with a warm golden glow, and a thick, woven rug provides a plush, if undeniably uneven, surface underfoot.  At the base of the tent pole stands a small wooden work table and a three-legged stool."
