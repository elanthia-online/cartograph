    "Groups of low sturdy chairs cluster around a circular firepit ringed with native riverstone.  One whitewashed wall is decked with banners of various Houses and orders, while the wall behind the bar bears beautifully preserved hunting trophies.  The bar itself is only a few long planks atop barrels, but serves its purpose well enough.  Citrus-scented candles burn near the windows to chase away vagrant mosquitoes seeking their own liquid refreshments."
