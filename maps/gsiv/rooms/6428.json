    "The largest building you have seen in the village stands to the north.  There is a long porch across its front.  Another small shack is still standing on the southeast side of the grass covered street.  To the northeast, a tall cliff face cuts across the valley.  An opening in the cliff face, which appears to be the entrance to an old mine, is shored by large timbers."
