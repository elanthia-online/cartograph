    "Beneath a black marble-tiled ceiling with a few cobwebs in the corners, an assortment of key-ringed lockpicks dangling on several hooks hangs on one of the mica-flecked black marble walls.  A locked faded modwir strongbox with gnomish markings and a locked ancient coffer engraved with Saramar runes sit in opposite corners while a partially hidden trapdoor blocked from view by a few stacks of empty crates rests on a black and white checkered marble tile floor."
