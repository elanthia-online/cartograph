    "Cutting a straight, wide line through the untamed grasses, the black sand pathway is lightened by bright white shells to the northwest and north, but darkens as it angles towards the sound of crashing waves.  Dried-out seaweed, splintered driftwood, and sturdy foundation stones lie scattered about the area indicating that habitats once stood here.  A heavy breeze passes through the area, carrying with it the dampness of the ocean.",
    "Cutting a straight, wide line through the untamed grasses, the black sand pathway is lightened by bright white shells to the northwest and north, but darkens as it angles towards the sound of crashing waves.  Raked sand, disrupted on its northwestern edge by invading waves, surrounds a square bungalow built on sturdy foundation stones.  A heavy breeze, carrying with it the dampness of the ocean, passes through the area."
