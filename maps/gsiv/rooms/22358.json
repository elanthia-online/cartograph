    "Surrounded by manicured lawns, the embassy is an artistic representation of a halfling ger rendered entirely in marble.  Ancient oak trees shelter the diminutive structure and create long shadows across the cobbled path that leads through the gates to the street.  Hidden amid the foliage and behind the trunks of the tower beauties, marble statues rendered in exquisite detail depict various historical scenes."
