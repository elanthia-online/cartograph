    "The path crosses a stony ridge, leading through a rough patch of boulders that dot the grassy area.  Songbirds flitter among the lindens, flickering patches of bright color in the light that filters through the trees.  An open valley lies to the northeast, and the rooftops of a village can be seen clustered in its center."
