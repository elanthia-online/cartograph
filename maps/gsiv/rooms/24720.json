    "The interior of the building is an eerie specter of what it once might have been.  The walls are splashed with age-old stains and almost every piece of furniture lies broken and in ruin.  The only furnishing of real consequence is a long wooden dining table that holds a tarnished silver tray with several smashed tea cups.  A rickety wooden stairway leads up to a second floor."
