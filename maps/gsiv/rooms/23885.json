  "description": [
    "A series of ivory-framed mannequins line the left side of the silk-draped room, the figures surrounded by tall bloom-laden vases and bowls.  Towards the center of the area, several pale wicker chairs encircle a glass-topped circular table, the surface etched with stylized birds in various positions of flight.  A cut-out vellum screen leads back towards the front room, the exit flanked by a pastel enamel stove and a beribboned sea grass basket."
