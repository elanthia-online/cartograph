  "description": [
    "Rising out of the waters of the mire, a small wooden platform claims this section of the midway as its home.  Moving between two painted stalls, a wide-eyed young girl attempts to hawk her wares to the passersby.  The sweet scent of sticky confections is incredibly heavy in the air."
