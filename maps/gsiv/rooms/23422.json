    "[A Dark Cave, Upper Landing]"

  "description": [
    "The upward slope of the cave evens out here to create a stable, if somewhat narrow, landing.  Light from a guttering torch affixed to the wall shows a dark tunnel leading out.  A pair of iron spikes secure the top loops of a thick rope ladder with leather ties, which leads back to the lower portion of the cave."
