  "description": [
    "An eruption of boulders, detritus of a rockslide, blocks the trail's advance to the east.  Many of the huge stones show cracks and scars from the violence of the fall down the precipice.  The resulting stair-stepped slope offers an escape from the gorge, made perilous by the continual onslaught of ice and snow."
