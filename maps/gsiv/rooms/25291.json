    "Ornate cobalt racks, hanging along the silver-painted walls, hold a variety of weaponry, and an elaborate tapestry sits between two such racks, depicting a well-muscled warrior and a fair empath maid.  A silver-draped four poster bed wreathed in pink resides in the center of the room, and a desk sits in one corner next to a bookcase crammed with tomes on battle tactics and chronicles of war.  Lining the floors are fluffy puma fur rugs, and a maoral worktable holds some unfinished weapons and a large wooden cupcake."
