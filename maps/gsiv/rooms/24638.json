    "Several cushioned chairs are scattered across deep green rugs, providing ample spots for sitting.  Footstools padded with the finest fabric accompany the seating.  Shelves of polished thanot have been erected to form two adjacent areas, where one partition boasts slippers and feminine boots, while the other inlet is topped with footwear for men.  Near one particular footstool, a single beribboned shoebox litters the floor."
