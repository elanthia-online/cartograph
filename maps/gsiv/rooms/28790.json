  "description": [
    "A luxurious featherbed rests against the western wall of this delightful room.  Next to the bed, a small pedestal table holds a crystal candy dish.  Set into the dark-stained paneled walls is a beaded ivory velvet curtain leading to the balcony.  Plush dark brown carpet keeps the room cozy, and a trio of chocolate-scented candles adorn the modwir fireplace mantle."
