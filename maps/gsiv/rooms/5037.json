  "description": [
    "An anvil-shaped sign hangs above the entrance of a wooden gatehouse, and a high modwir fence encloses the entire floating platform that stretches northward behind it.  A fellow wearing a leather work apron, which looks like it serves more as an over-taxed belly support than a protective garment, leans against the gatehouse wall."
