    "Racks used in the stretching of skins rest against the back wall, a few of them currently being used for their intended purpose.  Windows behind the racks have been left open, allowing light and a gentle breeze to enter the room.  A large tub filled with water and pieces of bark sits in a corner, several hides soaking in it.  In the middle of the room is a table covered with leatherworking tools and a pair of shears.",
