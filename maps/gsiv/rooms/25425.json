    "This is a large and spacious room, well-lit by numerous spherical iron lanterns hanging from the walls.  Dominating the room is a round red mahogany table, its lustre catching the ambient light and reflecting it.  Matching chairs surround the table, and the walls are papered with maps of the local wilds.  A smooth teak ladder in the west corner of the room disappears through a dark trapdoor in the ceiling."
