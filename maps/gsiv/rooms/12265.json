    "Bright red, orange, and white orchids grow wild along the street here, adding color to the mostly green flora.  The remains of an old bamboo hut, its walls crumpled in by time, can be seen off in the distance.  The scent of the sea wafts through here giving the area a fresh, clean aroma.",
    "Some orchids grow wild along the street here, adding a bit of color to the mostly green flora.  The remains of something can be seen off in the distance but it's hard to see what in the dim light that the torches give off.  The scent of the sea wafts through here giving the area a fresh, clean aroma."
