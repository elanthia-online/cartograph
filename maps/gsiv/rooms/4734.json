    "Hearty oaks crowd the barely visible path, their vast number disappearing into the murky shadows of the nether woods.  The undergrowth grows thick with wild abandon, threatening to swallow the remnants of the once cobbled road.  Those who pass this way must be careful to avoid becoming entangled in the sinewy vines and sharp briars of the uncontrolled foliage.  In the distance, the sound of flowing water gurgles softly, its origin unclear.",
