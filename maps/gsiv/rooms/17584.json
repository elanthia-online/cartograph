  "description": [
    "Framed by two windows, the front door is painted a deep navy blue and has hinges of wrought iron that are plated with decorative scrollwork.  A large display case crafted of steel and glass displays a variety of local fishes, neatly filleted for convenience, while a plethora of sea grass baskets house a mixture of cooking aids.  An archway leads through the store to the backyard, its opening allowing the scent of cooking fish to drift inside."
