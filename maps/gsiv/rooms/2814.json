    "A stand of hemlock trees mix with the other conifers, adding the gnarled silhouette of their branches to that of the pines.  Wind moves the limbs in a lazy dance, occasionally launching puffs of snow from them with a heavy gust.  The trail begins a gentle descent to the north, where vestiges of ground fog cluster and creep through the tree trunks."
