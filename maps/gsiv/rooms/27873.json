    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a bronzed drake sculpture.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the polished oak walls.  A gilded maple table and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
