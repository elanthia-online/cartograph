    "Dense brush crowds the cliff edge to the south, but here an expanse of ancient paving stones chokes out all but a few saplings and lines of weeds that have managed to take root in the seams.  Further to the north, single blocks of stone and the tumbled remains of buildings peek through the scrub and tall grasses."
