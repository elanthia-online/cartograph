    "The sounds of squawking seagulls and lapping waves filter in through an open window, and a layer of salt coats nearly every surface.  A ship's figurehead, deeply pitted and stained, looms over an old chart table.  In one corner of the room is a rope-trimmed chair with a silvery grey cat curled up on the seat."
