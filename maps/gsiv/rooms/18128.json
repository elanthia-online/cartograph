    "Dwarfing the large worktable in the center of the room, row upon row of pitted steel shelves line the walls.  Each wall shelf, as well as several additional cabinets and shelving units, is filled to near capacity with a diverse array of cork-stoppered flasks and bottles.  Though most are meticulously labeled, the lettering on some has long since faded.  Mortar and pestle sets, funnels, droppers, and assorted laboratory utensils are conveniently located on the tabletop."
