    "This extremely tight room barely fits a handful of people comfortably, though it could hold more if packed together tightly like a mass of squirming fish caught in a net.  The room is dimly lit by patches of glowing moss which quiver at the occasional circulating breath of overpoweringly brine-scented air.  Drops of water plunk down from the ceiling to meet the lurking, grey mist undulating in thick pools on the sandy ground.  A rounded stone bench off to the side provides some seating."
