  "description": [
    "Set against the far wall of this moderately sized room is a semicircular deringo bar surrounded by an array of matching bar stools.  Bottles of all shapes and sizes rest upon the shelves behind the bar, their colorful labels each proclaiming their heritage.  Candles set upon wrought iron candelabra circle the room, giving off a warm glow as patrons enjoy their spirits.  An iron and oak spiral stair in the corner winds through the ceiling to the upper floor, and an oak-framed dart board hangs on the wall."
