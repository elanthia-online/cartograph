    "A small oak-hafted steel sickle gleams wickedly from its position discarded on the ground in the vermillion corn husks beside a pyramid of stacked crates and a wooden ladder.  It is obviously a well cared for farm implement, but someone seems to have left it lying here for someone to possibly injure themselves on."
