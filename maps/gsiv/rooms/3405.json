    "Walls of white contrast with the colorful footwear on display in this part of the clothier's.  Customers browse through the wares nearby, handling the boots and slippers while discussing prices with a young clerk.",
    "The walls of this shop are painted a pristine white and accented with several blue markings to look like small snow-dusted mountains.  Resting atop a circular animal print rug is a pair of low shelves, each filled with a variety of colorful footwear.  Positioned neatly between the shelves is a small sign, with a smug looking shop clerk next to it.  Off in the corner, a short stove filled with glowing embers offers limited amounts of warmth.",
    "Pristine white walls accented with silvery swirls create the illusion of windblown snow.  Several clear glass tables displaying slippers and shoes sit upon luxurious white carpet.  Along the rear wall, two narrow glass shelves stand bearing several styles of boots.  Positioned between the shelves is a small sign, with a smug-looking elven clerk close by.  Off in one corner, a short stove filled with glowing embers offers limited amounts of warmth, making this room a bit colder than the rest."
