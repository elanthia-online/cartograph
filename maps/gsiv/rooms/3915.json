    "The tunnel threads its way through a series of rock columns.  Each is carved in the image of a tree trunk, with finely rendered bark, branches and an impossibly complex pattern of leaves overhead.  The elegant bend of the branches that lift from the boles create an intricate pattern of shadows within the shifting cloud of dust that moves through the ageless trees."
