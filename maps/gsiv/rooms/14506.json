    "White riverstones create a slender pathway through the tall grasses that lead both northeast and southeast towards various small structures, situated around a small pond.  Set at the heart of a small garden, a simple bench is arranged to face the quiet waters of the pond.  Glass lanterns arranged upon copper poles rest at various points along the path, though they are dormant now.",

Glass lanterns arranged upon copper poles rest at various points along the path offering soft illumination for the area."
