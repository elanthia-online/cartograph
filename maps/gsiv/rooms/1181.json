    "The river is funneled through a narrow chasm.  The blockage forces the waters to spread out behind the gorge's mouth, flooding the opposite bank.  Several large, healthy oaks protrude up through the water at the edge of the lake, indicating that the volume of water may be only temporary or seasonal.  An eagle rests in the upper branches of one of the oaks, apparently sleeping and blissfully ignorant of your progress along the trail.",
