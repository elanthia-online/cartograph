    "Throngs of people travel westward towards the Market Square and the shouts of peddlers hawking their wares reach your ears.  The unmistakable scent of chocolate wafts from the doorway of a small, whitewashed shop on the north side of the street.  To the east you can see the hulking facade of the Solhaven Inn."
