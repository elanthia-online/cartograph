    "The natural stone pier has been worn for countless years by wind, surf, and storm, making the surface irregular and difficult to navigate.  A spray of salty sea water covers the rocks each time a wave crashes against the pier, making the surface treacherously slippery.  Marine life gathers in pools and in cracks in the pier."
