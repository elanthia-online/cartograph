    "Bundles and stacks of straw are scattered about the area making footing uncertain at best.  Most of the piles leaning against the wall are rotted with age, their shape held together more by habit than the frayed cord securing them.  Oddly, a few of the hay stacks seem almost fresh from the fields outside the castle gates."
