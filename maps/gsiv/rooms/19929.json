    "The room opens up into a large antechamber surrounded by walls of pale limestone, brightened from silver moonlight streaming in through glass windows.  A long navy blue rug stretches from a brass-trimmed door to a circular front desk where a female elven clerk smiles warmly.  The sound of clanking glasses is heard coming from a brass archway and glowing candles illuminate a broad hallway.",
