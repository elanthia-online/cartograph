    "A gigantic oak rises out of the dark night, surrounded by a pool of flickering light.  Burning torches stand in holders set near the base of the trunk, throwing eerie shadows about as they flicker.  In the light provided by the torches a path can been seen encircling the tree, and a faint light can be seen from either side of the fork."
