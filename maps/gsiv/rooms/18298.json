    "Fluffing their feathers against the cool night air, large seabirds huddle together on the large boulders shoring up the sturdy ground leading to the jungle.  Activity is minimal; the only noticeable movement is the unceasing ocean as it laps at the rocky shore.  Turned obsidian black by the night sky, the sea spreads out like a murky blanket into the horizon.  Looming to the north, a thick wall of darkness marks the shadowed jungle flora."
