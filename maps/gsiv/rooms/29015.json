    "This well-appointed boutique has a sheen of class and sophistication that shines through the roughness of Kraken's Fall.  Fanciful standing candelabras cast a flickering light against the lacquered wood panels decorating the boutique's walls, while two mannequins model the store's wares from within tall brass-framed glass cases.  A fashionable salesman dressed head to toe in the store's offerings tends to the needs of browsing customers."
