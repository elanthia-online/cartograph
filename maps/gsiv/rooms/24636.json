  "description": [
    "With one hand held out as if to greet someone, a statue of an elven lad is carved of smooth, pure white ivory.  He is dressed elegantly, with the richness of the carving depicting a fine high-necked cotehardie over hosen.  The statue's expression is completely obscured by the full-faced silver mask that covers all except his sapphire-inset eyes.  Opposite the masked lad, a tall ivy-painted ivory dresser is propped open."
