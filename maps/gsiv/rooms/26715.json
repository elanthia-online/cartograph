  "description": [
    "Tall blue and white doors line the narrow corridor, their barnacle-covered brass handles hanging loosely by bolts long corroded from water and age.  Wood of indeterminable origin clings to the ship's frame, leaving large fractured cracks in which various fish weave to and fro throughout the wreck."
