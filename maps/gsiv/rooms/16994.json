    "The walls in this dark and gloomy room are painted black.  A dim light flickers from a tank full of squirming, serpentine bodies in one corner.  Against one wall is a set of shelves acting as an apothecary: several bottles of various shapes and sizes are lined up neatly there.  Sawdust is scattered on the floor, forming a thick carpet.  Something smells odd here."
