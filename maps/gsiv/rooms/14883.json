    "The flowers here have been planted specifically to attract a wide assortment of butterflies.  The vegetation grows in large, colorful clumps of asters, daylilies, goldenrod, milkweed, verbena, and marigolds.  However, no activity is present in the cool darkness of the night.",
    "The flowers here have been planted specifically to attract a wide assortment of butterflies.  The vegetation grows in large, colorful clumps of asters, daylilies, goldenrod, milkweed, verbena, and marigolds.  An occasional hummingbird makes an appearance as great swallowtails, monarchs, painted ladies, and mourning cloaks flit languidly from blossom to blossom."
