  "description": [
    "The ice-covered plain comes to an abrupt end as the ground drops off into a steep, impassable cliff.  A nearly vertical slope of jagged stone and sharp ridges leads down to the fog-shrouded terrain below, and the occasional chunk of ice or stone loses its tenuous hold on the cliffside and tumbles off into oblivion."
