The only light is an ambient, faint greenish glow that seems to emanate from the rocks themselves, and flickering firelight emitted from a jagged crack in one wall.  Shadowy shapes loom in the periphery of vision that could be anything from a stalactite to a vicious cave dweller.",

The only light is an ambient, faint greenish glow that seems to emanate from the rocks themselves, and flickering firelight emitted from a jagged crack in one wall.  Just inside the edge of light is a dark stone shelf holding a stack of rectangular objects.  Shadowy shapes loom in the periphery of vision that could be anything from a stalactite to a vicious cave dweller."
