  "description": [
    "A substrate of igneous rock supports an earth-covered expanse just beyond the nearby cavern.  An abundance of plant life thrives in the open air.  Delicate ferns and mosses grow in and beside a ragged fissure, while grasses and arboreal specimens proliferate farther out toward the terrace edges.  The salty fragrance of sea air drifts lightly on the occasional breezes."
