    "Dark shadows crawl along the failing fence that continues along the eastern side of the road, struggling as if to break free from the confines of the graveyard.  A tall tree looms behind the fence, twisted and warped as it turns toward the muddy street.  Thick auburn sap oozes from it in several places, and occasionally drops from one of the claw-like limbs that hang over the fence."
