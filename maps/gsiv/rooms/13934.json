  "description": [
    "Golden linden floorboards stretch from the arched modwir entry to the thanot panel walls, which are interrupted by double-wide windows thrown open to admit the cool river breeze.  Frosted globes are suspended from vaalin chains throughout the shop, illuminating the wares displayed in baskets, cupboards, and tables.  A long rope dangles a sign in front of a set of stairs opposite a divided door that leads outside."
