    "Decumbent shrubbery covers the ground beneath the tall trees like a lush blanket.  The surrounding area is littered with needles, pine nuts and other detritus.  Churned snow and mud is thoroughly mixed along the rutted trail that leads up the mountain.  Here and there, the pathway veers off in another direction to avoid fallen trees."
