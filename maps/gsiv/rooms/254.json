    "The massive gate of the Landing's boatyard dominates this stretch of road.  Through it can be seen boats in various states of repair, tied up at wooden docks or beached along the riverbank.  Just offshore lies a coastal sailer half-sunken in the river's shallows, and silhouetted against the dark horizon just to the northeast is the span of a sturdy bridge.",
