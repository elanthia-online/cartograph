  "description": [
    "The mountain is little more than a bare rise of gravelly sand, giving the view of the rest of the island.  In the center, a rocky outcropping represents the peak and appears to be made of solid rock.  Miniature evergreens climb and dance throughout the snowline, which stands about head high on a human.  Interspersed amongst the conifers are a variety of woodland animals."
