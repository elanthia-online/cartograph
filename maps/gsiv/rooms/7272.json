  "description": [
    "The overflow from the dammed creek floods this low-lying part of the graveyard, spilling over the banks and creating a sea of muck and ruins.  The graves here are all despoiled, the ornate coffins and their inhabitants long since victims to mouldering, watery decay and determined grave robbers.  A few rotted splinters of wood, corroded iron and brass fittings, and darkened shards of bone have been pushed to the surface of the bog."
