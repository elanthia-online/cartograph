    "A painted silk wall panel hangs on one of the smooth white plaster walls, and an oak-framed ceiling rises overhead.  A thin gold-edge black runner sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a set of carved felwood shelves on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
