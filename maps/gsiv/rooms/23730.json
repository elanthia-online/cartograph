  "description": [
    "Constructed of stone and mortar, the small alcove is semicircular in shape and scrubbed until the stones glisten like the surface of a black pearl.  Silver light spills from the apex of the ceiling's curve where dozens of stars fashioned of metallic disks blaze in the candlelight amid a backdrop of purples, whites, and blues painted to resemble a nebula.  A low altar, draped with a simple cloth, resides along the back wall with a simple pew set before it, while a thick ebon drape leads into a small enclosure."
