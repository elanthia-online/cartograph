  "description": [
    "Rusty gears and cogs line the rough pine-planked walls in an entirely random and chaotic pattern, all fastened together with mismatching rivets of various size and alloy.  A pair of lopsided glass cases lines the back wall below an uneven row of brass hooks.  A mechanized glowbark crossbow is mounted to a plaque in the back corner, though it doesn't appear to be for sale."
