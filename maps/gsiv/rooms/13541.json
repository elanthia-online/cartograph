    "The bare stone walls of this tall tower room rise to meet a massive dome of crystal clear glass.  Sunlight floods the area, leaving no corner untouched.  Centrally placed is a large black oak table surrounded by some long padded benches, suitable for reading as a group.  Flanking a large potted plant is a cream-colored suede chair and a soft blue chair.  A wrought iron staircase leads back down to the Collections room.",
