    "A massive gaping hole along one wall has been crudely boarded up with old planks and an assortment of twisted branches.  At the foot of this barrier lies a immense worm whose decaying form is covered with numerous puncture marks.  Several deep stains along the wall and ground, along with some tattered cloth reveal that the oversized bug did not go out quietly."
