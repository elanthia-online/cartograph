  "description": [
    "Entirely windowless, the cozy den is illuminated by a cheerful fire, its smoke carried away by a polished copper hood suspended from the ceiling.  Wingback chairs with ottomans are clustered about, affording a place to converse or simply doze.  A mural depicting the known areas of Elanthia dominates the entire northern wall.  Three doorways of aspen, teak, and pine, occupy the southern wall, while three more doors are to the east."
