  ],
  "description": [
    "A fallen log half blocks the passage in to the forest.  It has been awhile since the tree fell -- the log is rotting and slightly damp.  At first glance it appears dead, though a closer look reveals that it is actually teeming with life.  Small ants scurry across the surface while a brightly colored beetle chases them down."
