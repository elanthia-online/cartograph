  "description": [
    "The pit is barren sans carved lengths of sharpened logs stuck into the ground.  The ground is stained with dried blood and other fluids pooling around a pile of impaled suits of armor in the exact center.  A frayed rope dangles into the pit from above, its excess length messily coiled on the barren floor."
