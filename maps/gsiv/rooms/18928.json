    "White limestone blocks punctuated by burled oak window frames form sturdy walls for this guild hall.  A roof composed entirely of driftwood presents interesting contours and twisting patches of light and shade atop the hall, while double doors of bamboo and lattice construction stand open, inviting entry.  Above the doors a painted insignia looms ominously, and a burled oak plaque mounted next to the doors announces the ownership of the hall.  Torches stand next to the doors, illuminating the entry."
