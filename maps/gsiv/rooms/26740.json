    "Built directly into the side of the cliff, the cramped cottage appears to be owned by someone in the burial services.  Shims, planes, hammers, and nails are discarded upon the uneven floor, while various chisels rest beside marble and stone slabs on a long grungy worktable.  Long planks of planed oak rest against the stone walls at the back of the room, while piles of finished and unfinished burial devices are stacked near the door.  A copper-ringed oak barrel filled with shovels rests in the center of the space."
