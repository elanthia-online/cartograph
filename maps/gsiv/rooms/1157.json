  "description": [
    "The muffled roar of the Locksmehr River drifts in from the east, blending with the chirping of birds and chitters of squirrels.  The ground slopes gently away from the riverbank towards a low spot in the forest to the northwest.  The thick forest hinders any breeze's attempts to stir the temperate yet humid air.  The path to the southeast continues towards the river."
