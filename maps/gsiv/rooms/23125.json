    "[Ancient Passage]"

  "description": [
    "Grey, time-worn limestone walls provide a grim atmosphere to this wide hallway.  The high ceiling and thick layer of pale silt covering the floor provide hints that the passage may once have boasted a smooth, plaster veneer.  A narrow crack in the northern wall starts just above the floor and climbs toward the ceiling from east to west."
