    "A polished counter of lacquered black oak curves along this darkened corner of the tavern room.  Circular plates of silver have been set into the surface of the wood, their etched faces glimmering against the dark hue of the oak.  The frequent clanking of tankards and loud cheers from the tavern seem muffled and distant in this isolated section of the inn."
