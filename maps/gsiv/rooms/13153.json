    "Mirror-polished granite encompasses the entire hall with the exception of a mural occupying the western wall.  Predominantly dwarves and giantmen pass through the vicinity, acknowledging each with a curt nod before moving on with their business.  A white rune-etched stone door has been left open, allowing a clear view of the office of the Taskmaster, hard at work."
