    "The broad sweep of the mosaic floor is interrupted by an ornate bottled ship.  Halfway to the bamboo-rafter ceiling, a silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the white silk-paneled walls.  A cedar and oak footlocker and an oversized sea chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
