    "Canvas sheets are strung across the ceiling of the small alcove, the bright indigo and silver fabric providing a protective screen against the elements.  Small pockets in the walls house candles that illuminate the area at all times of the day and night.  Several chairs are arranged in loose circles throughout the space."
