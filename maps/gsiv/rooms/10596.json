    "Worms and insects ooze out of the dirt walls and creep along the floor in this small, squat chamber.  In the center of the chamber is a circle of black rocks, the top of each rock is painted with a silver crescent moon.  Inside the circle of rocks sits a stone sculpture of a woman with wild hair driving a chariot pulled by four stallions.  Moonlight streams in from the opening in the short ceiling, striking the sculpture and casting the shadow of a wild-haired woman on the dirt walls.",
