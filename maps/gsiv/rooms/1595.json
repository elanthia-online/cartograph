    "Wide, shallow steps of polished black stone lead upward from the north side of the avenue, piercing the sandstone wall that runs west to the edge of Eorgina's compound.  The steps end at a pair of felwood doors, each bearing a crimson cat's head carved into its center.  Poised to each side of the steps is a tall, gold leaf covered feline statue, their amber metal gleaming in the starlight.",
