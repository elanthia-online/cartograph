    "Yellowish-white mildew clings to a narrow cot, an aging maoral desk, a low chest, and every other organic surface within this small chamber.  Beads of water roll slowly down from a tiny crack above the cot, and then, diverted by a splinter in a support beam, slide along the splinter and splash down into a wide puddle on the waterlogged mattress.  More puddles have long since washed all ink from the fragmenting scrolls scattered over the floor."
