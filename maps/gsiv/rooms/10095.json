    "A large hill rises to the north, its base wreathed by a wavering ring of pale white mist.  Wavy blades of longrass make up the entirety of its base, shivering and stirring with every faint gust of wind that passes by.  A few oaks cluster around the area, their leafy boughs adding a touch of pleasant shade.  A thin trail winds its way through the tall grasses, ascending up toward the peak of the green hill."
