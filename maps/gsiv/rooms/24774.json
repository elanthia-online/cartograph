    "The view from the top of the castle is breathtaking.  As you step out onto the half-enclosed roof, you get the feeling of being on top of the world.  A Wehnimer's flag flutters in the breeze atop the east towers, and a large cannon stands at the ready, its barrel pointed toward the sea.  A large wooden tub sits in the center of the rooftop, filled to the brim with bubbling water.  Obviously the guards who man this post enjoy their comfort during peaceful times."
