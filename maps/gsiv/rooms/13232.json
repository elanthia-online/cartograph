    "The library's massive entry hall is fully panelled in rich, dark maoral.  Pale creamy marble covers the expansive floor, punctuated occasionally by a small golden tesserae set at cross-angles with the tiles.  Large antique tapestries cover the wall behind the main knowledge keeper's desk, illuminated by the sunlight flooding in from intricately worked glaesine windows at each end of the hall.",
