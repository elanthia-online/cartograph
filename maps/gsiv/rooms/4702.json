    "A patched canopy shields this tiny shop from sun and rain, though more importantly, the thick wooden rails along the perimeter protects patrons from suffering a terrible demise at the hands of gravity.  The melodious warbling of songbirds sets a pleasant atmosphere for the jewelers to work under, crafting lovely baubles and trinkets.  A circular table covered with velvet displays their beautiful creations.",

The faint songs of crickets echo from far below, setting a peaceful atmosphere to peruse the wares.  A circular table covered with velvet displays beautiful jewelry from the resident craftsmen."
