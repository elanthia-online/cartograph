    "Each of the walls within the cottage are lined with numerous paintings.  Sitting atop a long counter lie a glass-covered display case and a silk-lined cedar box, both displaying wares for sale.  A single swinging door leads back outside, while a sky blue silk drape leads further into the shop."
