  "description": [
    "The path divides at the edge of a clearing serenaded by a waterfall.  The water cascades over the edge of a granite bluff guarding the north edge of a small lake, its confluence fed by a stream which meanders away into the forest.  Water birds feed serenely on the lake's bank, their elongated legs giving them an exaggerated gait, as if they are moving in slow motion."
