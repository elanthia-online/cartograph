    "Although small, this shop appears to be the depository for just about anything anyone could possibly want.  Precariously loaded shelves fill the room and customers avidly browse the inventory.  Standing at a roomy counter, keeping an eagle eye on the scene, is an elderly shopkeeper.  A fat grey cat graces the counter with his presence and looks up, annoyed, as a customer places a package too close to his tail, but he is soon catnapping once again in a patch of moonlight.",
