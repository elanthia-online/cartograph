    "A single large stalactite hangs suspended overhead, more resembling a massive column than a formation of nature and the ages.  Faint bands of stylized patterns run around the pillar of stone, arcing across it in a series of converging loops.  A few ancient bones lie in piles near the walls, marking the four branches of the tunnels."
