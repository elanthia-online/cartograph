  "description": [
    "Ample and well-illuminated, its partially open windows allowing constant and a much-needed flow of fresh air, the map room provides room for quiet study and research.  Myriads of maps, historical battle accounts, and biographies are neatly stacked on stout floor-to-ceiling shelves and cabinets.  Oversized tables provide a proper surface on which to pore over the treasure of information available at members' fingertips."
