    "Lacquered bamboo poles coax the gold-veined onyx marbrinus silk panels into a peaked ceiling that supports frosted glass globes.  The smooth tent walls ripple slightly with the passage of customers and pool upon woven rugs designed in mimicry of marble tiles.  Occupying the center of the room is a carved golden linden table laden with refreshments, while several wicker-backed chairs and plush velveteen settees are arranged under the glow of dangling glass orbs in groups of three and four."
