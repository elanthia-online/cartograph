  "description": [
    "A humid breeze emanates from the yawning chasm to your west, carrying with it the too-sweet stench of tombs.  Luxuriant growths of lichen within the pit reveal the dark outline of a narrow bridge spanning it, but give no hint as to its depth.  The bridge itself has been kept scrupulously free of lichen, perhaps because the only way of seeing the span is by noting the dark path where the luminescent growth is not."
