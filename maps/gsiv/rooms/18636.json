    "Piles of splintered wood litter the floor, each plank bearing the name of a ship long ago destroyed.  Some have been singed by fires at sea, others punctured and broken by harpoons and other projectiles.  Sitting amid the piles are a few bones, looking disconcertingly as if they came from elves, humans and dwarves."
