    "Large windows frame the small room, their glassless faces gazing out into the verdant foliage of Eastern Harbor.  Poised catty-corner, a large featherbed covered in tropical-patterned quilts rests beneath a mosquito net that is anchored in the white ceiling, while a painted cassone rests at the foot."
