    "A sheer, rocky cliff stands at the east end of the grassy veldt, forming an impassable barrier to the plateau high above.  Piles of rocks of various sizes lie at the base of the cliff, having fallen over the years from the rough crags overhead.  An island of hardwood trees stands to the west, rising from the green plain.",
