  "description": [
    "Deep wooden shelves cover the walls of this room.  The shelves are crammed with books all bound in a uniform night blue binding.  Where there are no bookshelves, elaborate tapestries covered with mythical beasts picked out in bright colors hang.  The only furnishings are a massive blackwood desk and chair and a curious green orb resting on a golden stand."
