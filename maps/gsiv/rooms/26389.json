  "description": [
    "Fresh pine sap, sticky and golden brown, oozes from the cut ends of multiple lengths of newly planed boards laid diagonally across sturdy pilings buried in the waist-deep muck.  Rounded teak pegs affix each board in place, forming a sturdy walkway for egress through the darkest part of the swamp.  Colorful lanterns cast a silvery-grey light across the foliage-choked miasma, occasionally highlighting pairs of unblinking eyes staring up through the watery undergrowth."
