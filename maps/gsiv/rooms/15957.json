  "description": [
    "A snow-covered meadow is ringed by pines, the deep green of the boughs almost black in contrast to the glistening white snow.  The snowdrifts covering the clearing undulate like a frozen sea.  Sprigs of frozen grass break through the surface here and there, and within the trees lights twinkle where houses are nestled cozily among the protective foliage."
