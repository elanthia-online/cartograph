    "The long circular stairwell leads to a large sitting room with a polished red stone floor shot with white jagged streaks.  A lacquered cherrywood bar is in the center of the room surrounded by plush white velvet benches, while similar coral red benches lining the edge of the room provide comfortable observation of the sprawling scenery out the large glaes windows."
