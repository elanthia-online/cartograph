  "description": [
    "Copper flashing on the rooflines protect their buildings from water seeping in from the outside.  Many of the owners have staved off the elements damaging the copper and kept the brilliant shine by polishing the copper and then letting a clear sheet of water freeze over it.  Moonlight further accents the tones on the metal with its yellow beams reflecting off the surface of the flashing."
