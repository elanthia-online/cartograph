    "Broken chairs are stacked to fill the bow side of this forehold.  Discarded furniture litters the already crowded area.  Racks filled with miscellaneous objects line the winding yet clear walkway through the maze of junk.  Hooks line the starboard wall, hung with dusty old discarded garments.  The only observable exits are a hatch up to the deck and a path through the maze towards the rear hold."
