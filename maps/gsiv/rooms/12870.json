  "description": [
    "The road continues to the north and south, partially covered with light fog, and flanked by the occasional home or barn that rests beside it.  A small mound rests on the opposite side of the fence, adorned with a marble, sunburst-carved marker.  Blooming before it is a single white blossom, its bright petals providing a stark contrast to the darkness of the area."
