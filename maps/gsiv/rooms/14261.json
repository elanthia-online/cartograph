    "Running from floor to ceiling on the western wall is a series of whitewashed cabinets with etched glass fronts.  Standing directly beside them is a short writing desk covered with an orderly pile of papers and journals.  Wide examination beds, four in all, occupy the center of the room and are covered with crisp white linens, while a pair of river reed baskets hang around the arch leading into the central foyer."
