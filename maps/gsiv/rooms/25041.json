    "Racks of steel armor and weapons lay in heaps beneath the slitted windows of the tower, scattered amongst oil-filled rags and other small tools.  The ornamentation of the pieces have been tarnished by hunks of gore splattered across their surfaces, the bloodstains covering the entire room in a curtain of crimson.  An intricate circle of chalk sits centered upon the ground, the circumference leaving a blackened ring radiating out towards the open windows."
