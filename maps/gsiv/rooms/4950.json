    "Several boulders are scattered across the emerald green grass that blankets the plateau.  The path winds its way in between the larger rocks while smaller stones rest on the path itself.  A pine tree towers over the path, its lower branches providing shelter against the elements.",
    "Several boulders cast their moonlit shadows across the dark grass that blankets the plateau.  The path winds its way in between the larger rocks while dark stones create a hazard to progress along the path.  A pine tree towers over the path, its branches swaying in the night breeze.",
    "Several tall shrubs cast their shadows across the dark grass that blankets the plateau.  The path winds its way in between the greenery, splitting into a fork.  One way lays rough terrain, while the other way appears tended.  A pine tree towers over the path, its branches swaying occasionally in the breeze."
