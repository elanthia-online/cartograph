    "The end of Micah Lane is perfectly squared off, the vertical stone wall rising all the way up to the almost invisible ceiling high overhead.  Several artists have used the surface as a way to show off their wares, covering every inch of the lower part of it with drawings and paintings.  Some of the artwork is obviously done by eager children while others were completed by master painters."
