    "The blackened field has been partially obscured by the number of wagons to the west, the scorched ground covered in a trio of summoning circles.  Set within the left and right circles are rounded iron cauldrons, filled to the brim with several bones coated in a tar-like substance, the thick liquid slowly travelling down the sides of the tubs.  The center cauldron lays crushed amongst the dead reeds, leaving dozens of small, life-like dolls splayed out within the puddle of gore."
