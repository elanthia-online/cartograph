  "description": [
    "Nutrient starved trees arc toward the dismal sky, their leafless and spindled limbs spreading outward in all directions and clogging the pathway.  Wild cords of thorn-edge vines weave between the rotting woods to create a fence that blocks passage between the towering giants.  Several animal corpses litter the ground beneath the laden brambles, their skulls and ribs pierced through by thorns that are as long as a rapier.  A narrow sinkhole has gathered much of the muck in the area."
