    "Layers and layers of colorful seashells have been plastered onto the walls, leading up to a low bamboo ceiling.  Spotted chitons and spiraled nautiluses join the array of shells that draw the attention of the passing customers.  Spindly wooden pedestals rise up next to the walls, each displaying a sample of roofing material for sale in the shop.  The room is further lit by jars of twittering fireflies that have been placed on various shelves around the area."
