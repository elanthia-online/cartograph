    "Large squares of white cobbles form the walls and ceiling of the tunnel, while a dirt floor stretches to the north and south.  Devoid of ornamentation, the only decoration in this passage is a pair of matching torches that dispel the darkness of Mist Harbor's underbelly with their steady glow."
