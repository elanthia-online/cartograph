    "The room is dark except for a single burning lantern held aloft by a thick rope.  Nestled into the far side of the room and attached to each side of the bulkhead is a sailcloth hammock.  A large cast iron bucket sits in the center of the room, filled to the brim with carved wooden ducks.  There is a single iron hook hanging above the bucket, with a few pieces of clothing on it."
