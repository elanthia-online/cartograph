    "White brocade walls rise from a polished oak floor.  Just above a serene golden wyvern fountain hangs an intricate knot-worked wall-hanging, and a high arched ceiling completes the picture.  An elegantly carved oak armoire and an aqua-hued seaglass display stand side by side in the middle of the room."
