    "Anchored by black iron bolts, dark blue goat hair sheets are hung from the walls and ceiling of the chamber and mostly obscure the marble of the structure.  Thick rugs of soft viridian stretch throughout the chamber and support a variety of fur-heavy wooden cots, while an enormous black iron basket, lined with copper and filled with a brightly burning fire, occupies the center."
