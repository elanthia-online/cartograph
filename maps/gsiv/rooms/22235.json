  "description": [
    "Stacked stone bricks covered in creeping ivy create a wall around this grassy enclosure.  Pairs of wooden benches are scattered around the grounds, and a flourishing garden, filled with yellow daffodils and purple irises, produces a sweet aroma that wafts through the air.  A young sylvan woman, carrying a wicker rose-filled basket, wanders the garden, offering flowers to the seated couples."
