    "A few sparkling spokes of crystals protrude from the craggy ceiling, reflecting the faint light filtering into the area.  The tunnel turns sharply here, crossing into a sharp descent then beginning an ascent to the southwest.  Green and white lichen spreads across the rough floor, serving as a tattered and fuzzy carpet."
