  "description": [
    "The hard-packed dirt floor around the table is marked with dozens of sets of overlapping footprints, and a slight haze of tobacco smoke lingers in the air.  Wooden posts suspend colorful glass lanterns and hold up a thatched grass roof, beneath which a family of birds nests.  An overflowing tarnished brass spittoon leans precariously against one wall, threatening to overturn."
