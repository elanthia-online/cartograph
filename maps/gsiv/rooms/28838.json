  "description": [
    "Etched crudely into the ground is a vast circle with runed edges, the attempts of its creator to follow the bend of the rocky ground resulting in a shape that is slightly oblong and malformed.  More shapes, from simplistic linework to complex runes, line the inside of the circle.  The edges are blackened and burnt, the surrounding stone smooth save where it is pocked with popped air bubbles.  There is a small break in the circle."
