    "This narrow workroom is more brightly lit than the main part of the wagon.  Flickering torches cast constant shadows across the bare walls, and several barrels of varying sizes stand in one corner.  Dominating the cramped space is a small worktable with a high-backed chair placed behind it.  Scuff marks and gouges cover the floor, though they appear aged and dusty."
