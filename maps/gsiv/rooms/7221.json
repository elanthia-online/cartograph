    "The chill is deep, soaking into your body and making your bones ache.  Skeletons long past feeling the cold have been stacked against the walls, coated in a blue-white sheen of ice.  A low tunnel burrows through the grey stone wall, funneling the frosty air into the area.  Spiderwebs flutter in the cold breeze, reaching out like grasping fingers to entangle you."
