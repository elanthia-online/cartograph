    "The room is small and the ceiling is slanted just slightly as it stretches towards a tiny, shattered window.  In one corner sits a diminutive makeshift crib crafted out of yellowed sharp teeth and broken shards of glass, with a stained headless doll laying inside.  Upon a warped wooden nightstand rests a small metal-based crystal snowglobe, the water inside long ago going brownish-black, obscuring whatever miniature was within."
