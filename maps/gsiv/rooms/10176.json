    "This small ledge hangs over a large outcropping of rock, giving a grand view of the lands below.  A stream runs down the slope of the low foothills, winding along the edge of the old, abandoned apple orchard to the south.  Deteriorating fields of barley and grapes stretch beyond the orchard to the west.  Stony cliffs rise up behind the ledge to the north, too steep for practical climbing."
