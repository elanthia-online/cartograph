    "Vibrant blue paint covers the floor, while yellow paint splashes across the walls.  Feathers hang from above, interspersed with charms of all shapes and sizes.  Covered in a massive quilt, a tiny bed takes up one corner of the room, across from a large worktable scattered with jewelry-making tools and various melted-down candles."
