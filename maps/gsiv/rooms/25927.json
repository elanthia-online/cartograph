    "A long wooden table stands along the western wall.  Before each table are several chairs, with a mirror hanging above the table before each seat.  Luminescent orbs glow brightly around each mirror.  A rack in the corner holds several cloaks and coats, ranging in size from halfling to human, while a single giant-sized cloak lies heaped on the floor."
