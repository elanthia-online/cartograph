    "A large fireplace of rough-hewn stone, the twin of the one in the Common Room, fills one wall of this comfortable room.  Flickering light from the hearth reflects off a long, brightly polished claidhmore that hangs above the mantle.  Comfortable looking chairs surround several tables that are scattered about the room rest on the thickly-woven carpet."
