    "The cascade of bones becomes steeper as it flows in from the east and out to the west, south and southwest, as if a radical change in the cavern's stone floor occurs somewhere down below.  The dry air makes breathing laborious, and dust rises easily, stirred up by even the slightest disturbance in the area.  The bones underfoot do not provide a sturdy walking surface, but instead shift downhill when only a little pressure is applied."
