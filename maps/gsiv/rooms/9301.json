    "High limestone walls surround the wide courtyard providing both privacy for those at practice and protection to the commoners beyond.  An oak ring set into the ground forms a perfect dirt-filled ring at the center of the yard where practice is held.  Wooden practice swords and padded gambesons stand in neat piles upon a shelf set beneath copper-roofed eaves.  Beyond the dirt practice area is a lush herbal garden with trailing vinca and honeysuckle vines snaking across the wall and its partially hidden garden gate."
