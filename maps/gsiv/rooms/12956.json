    "A hint of wan light silvers the many large stones that litter the grassy hillside.  A narrow track winds around the hill, spiraling downhill to the northwest and more steeply uphill to the east, where it disappears amongst a stand of nearly leafless hawthorn trees.  Dark, regular shadows mark the outlines of rooftops in the town below.",
    "Sunlight dapples the many large stones that litter the grassy hillside.  A narrow track winds around the hill, spiraling downhill to the northwest and more steeply uphill to the east, where it disappears amongst a stand of nearly leafless hawthorn trees.  From this slight elevation, the dark rooftops of the town laid out below are easily visible."
