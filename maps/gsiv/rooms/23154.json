    "This cramped space is cluttered with boxes and crates stacked from floor to ceiling.  Illuminated by a swath of glowing green mold, the closet is little more than an extra large vertical coffin.  One box has fallen over and spilled open, allowing its contents to be viewed, and despite the state of the room, the items appear to be in good shape.  The door leading out is barely visible in the gloom, its edges marked by an absence of glowing mold and a faint, stale draft from the other side."
