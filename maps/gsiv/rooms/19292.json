    "The vaulted crystal ceiling of the glass-enclosed room soars over massive hand-hewn oak beams.  Large clay pots planted with colorful wildflowers and greenery, and baskets of ivy hanging from the beams frame a breathtaking view of Willow Hall's garden.  The south wall is solid stone with a cascade of water falling over it into a pool at its base.  White wicker chairs and tables invite one to gaze up at the celestial beauty of the night sky overhead.",
