    "A low-hanging bridge built across the width of the stream blocks passage to the east, but the path along the edge of the stream is unimpeded to the west.  Silver-scaled fish dart around the shadows cast by the bridge, bursting briefly into the sky before falling back below the water's surface in an ongoing game of hide-and-seek with the sun.",
    "A low-hanging bridge built across the width of the stream blocks passage to the east, but the path along the edge of the stream is unimpeded to the west.  Occasionally the plopping sound of a light body hitting the water, perhaps a frog or water snake going for a swim, echoes hollowly from the dark shadows beneath the bridge."
