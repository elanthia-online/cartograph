    "Moonlight highlights the labyrinth of plants and trees punctuated by masses of vines hanging from the dense canopy.  Exotic, nocturnal flowers dot several of the malachite tendrils as they weave their way through the shadows in the vegetation, and the nighttime calls of various creatures are joined by the muted sounds of the ocean.  The gradual change in the terrain is clear as travel further south is restricted to a steeply descending path."
