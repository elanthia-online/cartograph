    "Slogging through the mud, dampness envelopes your lower limbs.  Wet garments cling closer to your tense body, making movement ever more exhausting.  Your breath comes fitfully in short gasps as the methanous air burns your lungs.  Acrawl with countless imagined leeches, your skin tingles with fear and revulsion."
