  "description": [
    "Three trestle tables, created from abandoned ship hulls, rest upon a broad cobblestone courtyard under the protection of a series of wide canvas sails that gleam brightly in the sunlight.  Two sets of iron tubs, used to illuminate and heat the dining area in the evenings, lay dormant to either side of the northern and southern pathways that lead in and out.  Some gently descending steps reside to one side."
