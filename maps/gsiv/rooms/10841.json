  "description": [
    "As the river widens here, the growth along the shallows takes stronger hold.  Reeds and rushes sway gently in the slow moving current and crowd the odd structures which line the waterfront as far as you can see.  The noise to the west gives way to the quiet sounds of waterlife of all sorts: croaking frogs, splashing fish and silently stalking them both, a heron standing regally at the waters edge.  Across the river, the forest is held at bay and seems a world apart from this island retreat."
