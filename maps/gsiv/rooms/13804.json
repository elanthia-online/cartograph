  "description": [
    "A lush bank of ferns crowds the edge of the stream, their fronds fanned out in elegant green arcs.  Overhead, pine boughs are thick with aromatic needles, and cottages beneath them are roofed in both needles and tiles.  The creek burbles and sings, sending sprays of white glistening in the air about the boulders that serve as a walkway across the water."
