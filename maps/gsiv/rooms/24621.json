    "Falling from the peaked ceiling in tailored pleats, the green silk forms smooth, ebon-veined walls and pools elegantly on onyx rugs.  Frosted glass lanterns dangle from faenor chains over a glass counter, providing excellent illumination by which to view the wares, while a pendant lantern hangs over a black lacquered table that houses additional wares."
