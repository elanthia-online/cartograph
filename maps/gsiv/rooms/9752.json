  "description": [
    "Following the turn of the tree's wall, the ramp offers less than reliable footing.  Bulges and gullies mark it as part of the living wall of the tree rather than an attached construction.  To the south, the way skirts a large tapestry covering the wall.  In the gulf between the curved sides of the monstrous tree, small globes hang on silvery threads so fine they are almost invisible.  Soft pinpoints of light flicker around the globes in various colors, as though sparks are orbiting each one."
