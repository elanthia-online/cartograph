    "A massive bronze seal lies embedded into the polished grey stone floor.  Standing opposite a wide, mithril-bound arch, a monstrous steel gate within the eastern wall gleams like a gaping maw leading into the depths filled with society's most malevolent souls.  Watchful eyes gaze out of a small adjacent small guard station, meticulously monitoring all the comings and goings."
