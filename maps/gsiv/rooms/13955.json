  "description": [
    "Partially opened boxes and crates of supplies lie about a large workbench that dominates the small loft.  The surface is cluttered with various molds, tools, and implements for fixing small items.  A brazier with banked coals sits to the side under a domed window.  Covered with a worn homespun blanket, a small cot is set up in the far corner of the room.  At the end of the bed is a large iron-bound trunk with a sturdy padlock."
