    "Tall pillars of stout polished pine rise skyward to support a web of steel.  The steel, in turn, supports a dome composed of large panes of stained glass, each of which bears the insignia of the Empath Guild.  Rows of emerald green benches stand on thick silver carpet to surround a tall round dais in this spacious circular room.  Along the perimeter herb bushes in bright brass pots lend a tangy scent to the air.  Above the herbs wall-mounted torches await nightfall.",
