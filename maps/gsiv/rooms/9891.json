    "Slight tendrils of mist reach out from the shimmering lake to the south, but neither they nor the tall linden trees they drift through are quite close enough to fall within the shadows of the twin towers rising gracefully from a huge moonstone building.  The crimson summit of a third tower peeks above the smooth dome that crowns the abbey.  A thin marble walkway ends in two imposing ebonwood doors, unfettered by the verdant ivy that clusters so thickly on the walls.",
    "Slight tendrils of mist reach out from the dark lake to the south, stretching lazily through the gloom towards a huge moonstone building.  Two slender spires rise gracefully from the structure, and the crimson summit of a third tower peeks above the smooth dome that crowns the abbey.  A thin marble walkway, pale in the moonlight, ends in two imposing ebonwood doors, unfettered by the verdant ivy that clusters so thickly on the walls."
