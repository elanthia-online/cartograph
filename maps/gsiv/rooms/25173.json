    "Thin sheets of frost have chipped away at the wood comprising the building, the rotted planks and ice forming a blackened background to a trio of faded banners pinned up against the back wall.  A chipped bloodwood bar sits along the right side while a quartet of barrels serve as makeshift seating, their bottoms covered in dried blood and dirt."
