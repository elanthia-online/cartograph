    "The airy workroom has a large yellow sun painted across the back wall.  Several soft white puma fur rugs are strewn across the floor, and some cozy cloud-shaped cushions are stacked in the corner.  Hanging from the high ceiling is a yellow curtain, its hemmed fabric suspended just above the ground."
