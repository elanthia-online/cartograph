    "The short ascent ends at a dirt clearing speckled with tufts of long-bladed grass.  To the west, the flat hillside opens into a small orchard bearing a few dozen haggard fruit trees.  To the east lies a meadow of thick grasses and vine-like tendrils reminiscent of an overgrown grape field.  An old wooden gate leads back down the hill to a series of wild meadows."
