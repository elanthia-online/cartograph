    "A thin cloud of smoke hovers throughout the shop.  Shelves fill almost every inch of wall space, most overstocked with tins of tobacco.  Bundles of drying tobacco hang above a dark wood counter.  A window behind the counter allows a small amount of moonlight into the room, but what does enter scatters in the haze to create a pale silver glow.",
