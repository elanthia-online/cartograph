    "Facing a wide archway is a single maple counter upon which sits a pair of quills and a large inkwell.  Thick black curtains have been drawn over all the windows, casting the room in perpetual darkness, save for the glow of three sconces set into the stone wall.  Behind the counter, the exchange clerk sits on a tall four-legged stool, his face plagued with a perpetual look of boredom."
