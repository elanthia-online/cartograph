    "A tiny cottage sits perfectly preserved within the glacier.  Several children's toys sit in the yard, and a broom leans against the stoop.  You can almost see smoke rising from the chimney, as if a fire still burned in the hearth.  But the windows remain dim, and the scene has an eerie air of timelessness about it."
