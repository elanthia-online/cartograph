    "Several long rectangular swatches of green cloth are fully laid out along the ground and covered in a layer of muddy tracks.  Overhead, the hive-shaped roof is crafted of palm fronds thickly matted together, though several have come loose from their binding and drape down from the ceiling.  Spreading out from the open hut, dense jungle sprouts up in most directions, though other huts are clearly visible through the foliage."
