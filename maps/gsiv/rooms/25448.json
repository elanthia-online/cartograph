    "Lengths of velvet hanging from the support beams above separate the large pavilion into several sections.  A make-shift floor of modwir tiles covers the ground, creating an elegant patterned floor.  Large window openings in the walls allow moonlight in to brighten the area.  Draped in ivory silk, a large archway is flanked by a pair of tables."
