    "Crushed limestone forms a small path leading away from the central flagstone walkway here.  A large patch of manicured turf flourishes despite the omnipresent shadow of the coliseum.  Several humanoid dummies of varying sizes stand at the far end of the green, while a slender imflass javelin has been thrust into the ground nearby.  A retired legionnaire stands watch over the testing grounds."
