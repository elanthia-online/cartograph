    "This room is tiny, and looks suspiciously like it might have once been a broom closet.  A spindly half-round table serves as a desk, though all it supports at the moment is the remains of a mincemeat pastry.  Genealogical charts paper the walls, some of the family trees more convoluted than an oxbow-riddled river."
