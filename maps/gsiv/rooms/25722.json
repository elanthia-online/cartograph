    "Square flagstones of blue, red, green, and yellow line the patio that is surrounded by closed, colorful umbrellas.  Twin booths, both bedecked in colorful pennants, stand side by side along the southern edge of the patio.  One is offering treats for the various animals of the island, and the other is offering gifts for visitors."
