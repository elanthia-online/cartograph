    "In the moonlight you can see the entire southern approach to River's Rest...the wide river all the way from the Tempest Falls in the east to Maelstrom Bay in the west, the South River Road, the town drawbridge.  To the north and west, with the exception of the busy Merchant's Walk and the onion-shaped spire of a minaret, much of the town itself is hidden by the trees.  A length of rope tied to an iron stanchion drops down through a trapdoor in the floor.",
