    "Velvet drapes are drawn back from a gold-framed painting, and a row of ethereal candles in glass holders illuminate the artwork.  Placed in a small vase on a pedestal next to the painting is a single red rose in full bloom.  A pair of crimson silk banners fringed with golden tassels frame either side of the hallway."
