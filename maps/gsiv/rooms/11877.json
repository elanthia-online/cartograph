    "The air is dry and stale, hanging heavily above the slimy surface of the water.  The heavy layer of scum reduces the projected light to a diffuse glow, and most of the walls and ceiling are not visible.  The scum clings to armor, boots, clothing, and most anything else it can contact.  Breathing is laborious at best due to the lack of air circulation."
