    "Rich, amber-hued marble and burnished copper fixtures accent the spacious office of the Guild Master.  A collection of hefty gem shards serve as paperweights upon a curious-looking desk.  Mounted prominently on the north wall is a coiled, roa'ter skin whip, while a gold-framed oil painting hangs on the opposite side."
