    "The path swerves sharply around a low, grassy mound.  The mound is covered with strange, spiky ferns.  The jungle foliage has overgrown the crumbling ruins on either side of the tidy path, but has been cut back to keep the pathway clear.  On one side of the path a series of rough, dark red stones and small white bones are arranged in a crude pattern."
