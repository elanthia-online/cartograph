  "description": [
    "A small stone building, wrought with a dark blue latticework, stands to the western side of the cobblestoned path, its arched windows and blue-tiled roof fashioned with meticulous care.  A particularly large willow spreads its leafy bough over the house, casting patches of deep verdant grass in both light and shadow."
