  "description": [
    "The treacherous trail hugs closely to the steep and rocky cliffside, making travel for groups a single-file affair.  Shattered shelfae scales lay broken upon the rock-strewn ground, marking the previous passage of hunters over this forbidding terrain.  The incessant pounding of waves far below is but a soft and rhythmic whisper at this height."
