    "Many spaces between the rough plank walls offer occasional breezes from outside.  Sitting in haphazard intervals around the perimeter of the room is a series of padded wooden chairs.  One wall houses a narrow doorway, while a small table graces the center of the space, complete with a large lit candle that flickers with each passing gust and causes the gems on the wooden surface to glimmer faintly."
