  "description": [
    "Perched atop the foothill is a squat granite tower topped with a white quartz dome.  The rounded roof of the edifice is shattered along the northern side, like a soft-boiled egg tapped open by a teaspoon.  A narrow path leads down the hill through the scattered ruins of the city, while a wider walk circles around a rise to the south."
