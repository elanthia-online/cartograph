    "The tortuous twists and turns of the trail seem to wind endlessly through a never-changing tunnel of dark tree trunks.  Shadows move within the gloom between the boles, products of the shifting boughs overhead.  However, an occasional low-pitched huff or growl betrays other, more menacing, sources of shadows within the ancient forest."
