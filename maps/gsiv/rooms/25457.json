    "An illustrated poster of steins and stein parts has been mounted above a large sturdy workbench on the back wall which is half-covered with an assortment of steins in various stages of completion.  A messy pile of misshapen steins and other discarded materials have been tossed into the back corner of the wagon.  A variety of mismatched, well-used floor pillows are strewn about for patrons to sit on and enjoy."
