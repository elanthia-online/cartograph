    "The gently sloping hillside is thickly wooded here, and footsteps fall silently on the dark, leaf-covered soil.  Tall ferns thrive in the shade between the trees, their fronds speckled deep green in the filtered light.  The walls of the town are visible in the distance through gaps in the woods, but only the sounds of the quiet forest reach here."
