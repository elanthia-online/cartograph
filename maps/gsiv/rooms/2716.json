    "About halfway up a steep slope, a small ledge stands exposed to the bitter elements, cleared of snow by the driving blasts of wind.  A trail to the west skirts the icy wall into a ravine below, and to the north a path winds its way up the rock-littered slope.  Both directions appear extremely dangerous."
