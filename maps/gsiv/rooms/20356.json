    "Dented bronze and glass pane lanterns hang from thick overhead beams of darkened fel.  Threadbare azure and silver banners are hung on the walls of the wagon and a dingy grey carpet covers most of the floor.  A legless statue sits in a corner, arranged so its lifeless gaze rests on a series of reinforced mannequins and a row of steel pegs."
