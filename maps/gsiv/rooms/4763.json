    "A dank odor, like the fetid smell associated with deep swamps or boggy regions, wafts through the air, disturbing the otherwise natural scent of the forest.  The branches overhead seem to hang lower, as if the weight of their leaves were becoming unbearable, causing them to bend their majestic limbs toward the leaf-strewn ground.  The bark of one oak is peeling backward, exposing the pale wood beneath."
