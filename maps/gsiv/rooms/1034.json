    "The trail drops gently to the southwest, descending into thick fog.  To the northeast it climbs steeply, rising out of the surrounding mists.  Long-bladed grass has taken root all over the area, but its attempts to cover the area are interrupted by boulders, the occasional odd tree stump, and patches of bare ground.  Even a few small pine trees make valiant attempts to combat the encroaching grass."
