    "Devoid of curtains, the open windows of in this room are heavily guarded by thick bars of wrought iron.  Copper lanterns are arranged in a cluster along the exposed rafters of the ceiling, their steady glow providing continuous illumination for the ironwood table positioned in the center of the room.  Not a single chair, stool, or couch can be found in the room, though someone has left a small teak tray in the northeastern corner."
