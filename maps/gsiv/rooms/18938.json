    "Curving walls are fitted with felt-lined shelves, each housing a variety of jars, canisters, and bins that are labeled in precise detail as to their contents.  Low counter tops ring the room beneath the shelves and provide clean spaces for measuring, grinding, and a variety of other alchemy tasks.  A scribe's desk is set near the intersection of the two storage rooms and has a tall stool before it."
