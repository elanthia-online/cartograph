  "description": [
    "The precarious dirt path that leads down from the bank strays close to the water's edge before widening into a small patch of marshy earth framed on three sides by riverstones.  Within the confines of this rudimentary \"garden\" are several glossy-leafed bushes laden with clusters of blue-black winterberries, as if someone were merely trying to cultivate the look of a purposeful planting with the rocky border.  A fitfully guttering lantern hangs from the nearby post, shedding minimal illumination."
