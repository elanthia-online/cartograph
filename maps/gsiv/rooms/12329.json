    "Floorboards of polished linden glitter with a golden glow as the sunlight reflects off of them, while colorful dragonflies flit amongst the bright pink dog rose vines that twine about the carved railings.

Slate blue sails slant across the space to create a bit of shelter from the island's harsher elements, their ends anchored to both the distant wall of the inn and the tree beyond."
