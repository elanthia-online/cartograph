    "This skeleton of a storm-battered treehouse no longer provides much shelter from the elements.  Only the flooring and sections of two walls remain relatively intact.  A small altar has been erected in one corner.  The branches sway gently in the breeze.  Through the thick, green leaves you can see the blue waters of Lake Tanai."
