    "Wooden plank walls keep in the warmth from a small fire pit that rests in the corner of this quaint shop.  A variety of trinkets and baubles are secured safely inside a wide display case, while a pair of bearskin-cloaked giantmen attend to customers from behind a long rosewood counter.  The light of a large bonfire outside glows through the shop's windows."
