  "description": [
    "Soft grass grows underfoot as the trail between the trees widens and the misty haze lightens here making this part of the jungle brighter.  Shrub-sized clumps of amber and yellow orchids grow near the path intermingled with ferns and other vegetation.  Blue and white bumblebee orchids have rooted themselves in the decaying remains of a large fallen tree trunk, while flowering vines of purple and white drape from the branches overhead, splashing the area with vivid color."
