    "To one side of the path lies a tank containing a small school of piranha.  On the bottom of the pool lie the gleaming white skeletons of the hapless victims that wandered into the tank and never made it out again.  The tank on the other side is home to a large school of minnows, several carp and a giant water beetle."
