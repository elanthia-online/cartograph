    "Dotted with a plethora of tiny holes, the muck at the edge of shoreline appears solid.  Miniscule rivulets of water cut spiderweb-thin patterns through the dirt, exposing the limestone base underneath.  Overhead, the branches of cypress trees spread far and wide, their drooping limbs dripping with thick moss."
