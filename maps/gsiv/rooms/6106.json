    "The square marble table's top matches perfectly with the marble in the second tier of the huge fountain that looms to the northeast.  The table's grey-and-white umbrella is closed, allowing a breathtaking view of the constellation-filled night sky.  A freestanding torch flickers brightly nearby."
