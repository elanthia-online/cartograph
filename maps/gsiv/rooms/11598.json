    "Stacks of wooden crates...some small, some the size of coffins...line one wall.  A large heap of moldy, decaying carpets is piled in the center of the room.  A half dozen rolled tapestries, stinking of mildew, lean against one of the oak support columns.  In one corner, barely illuminated by the soft light of a glowing orb, is a wooden rack on which hangs the tattered remnants of cloth."
