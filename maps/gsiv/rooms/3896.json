    "The road follows the cliff edge southeast toward the head of the falls and also to the west.  Gazing south beyond the rising mist of the Cascade of Tears, the rooftops of Solhaven stretch south between Vornavis' west wall and the waters of the bay.  Closer at hand, the docks, floating catwalks, and shabby buildings of Marshtown spread across the salt marsh."
