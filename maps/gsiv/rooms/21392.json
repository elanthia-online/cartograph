    "Small globes of glass hang from the ceiling, the candles within them shedding bright light around the surroundings.  Some areas of the white walls are draped with bright red silks and pitch black satins, the fabrics occasionally woven together where they cross over one another.  A plush white rug spreads out beneath several cushioned chairs and a glass table.  The table seems to magnify the sizable dark red stain and nearby spatters, reminiscent of a spray of dried blood, on the carpet below it."
