    "The wall behind the table is cluttered with memorabilia from past Pennant Chase events.  A high-backed chair resembling a throne has a variety of initials carved into it, with some of the initials viciously crossed out with deep, chiselling slashes.  A painting of thraks running diagonally across the table top catches your eye."
