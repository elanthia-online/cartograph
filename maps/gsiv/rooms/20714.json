    "Large enough to encompass the whole back half of the villa, this room is light and airy, with floor-to-ceiling windows across the northern wall.  A variety of glowing orbs dangle from the ceiling above the many tables.  Between two of the windows, a pair of glass double doors lead outside, while on the wall opposite, a carved rosewood arch and a rounded ebonwood arch offer additional exits.  Set slightly away from the eastern wall, a long mottled marble counter holds a variety of refreshments.  The scent of roasting meat emanates through a swinging door leading to the kitchen."
