    "Yellowed fragments of cobbled road, held together by chalky mortar, lie half-hidden beneath the decaying leaves and vine-like tendrils of the forest undergrowth.  Bordering the old moss-grown path, tall black oaks stand like silent guardians, watching over their surroundings.  Somewhere in the distance, a large hound or wolf howls, a vague sense of loss suggested by its tone.",
