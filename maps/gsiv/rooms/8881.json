    "Twin evergreens pruned into three-dimensional spirals stand as a gateway to the well to the south.  A formal garden of carefully groomed bushes and domestic flowers fits into curving geometric shapes, the walkways trailing the outer edges of the arcs.  A high wall sets the exquisite garden off from the rest of the neighborhood."
