    "On the inner side of one of the table legs, a small nest is visible.  Dozens of ants scurry about on the floor as they indulge happily in spilled brew and ale from the previous messy patrons.  Serving as a most unique centerpiece, a piece of amber has been cut into the shape of a star and holds the fossilized remains of several unknown tiny creatures."
