  "description": [
    "A niche in the ravine wall partially conceals the low opening of a small cave.  A rough natural shelf of stone protrudes from the wall next to the cave, its flat surface covered with soot, old wax, and scraps of burnt offerings left over the years.  The greyish splotches of huge bird droppings, most of them dried by the sun and wind, cover the dirt and stone of the ledge."
