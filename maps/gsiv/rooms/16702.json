    "Large cooking fires run the length of the tent, sending plumes of smoke up to an opening in the peak of the ceiling.  Chunks of meat, some still resembling their former possessors, roast on thick iron spits and fill the tent with a nauseatingly sweet aroma, accompanied by the sound of fat sizzling as it drips into the flames.  Bones and pieces of flesh litter the floor, evidence of a combination of poor tableside manners and animalistic carnage.  In the shadows of the tent, something is feeding."
