    "Torchlight glimmers on the armory's marcasite-flecked granite walls and across the dull sheen of the smooth black slate floor.  Stacks of leather and heavy cloth are piled atop a bench near the back of the shop, ready to be fashioned into tunics and robes.  A clerk sits behind a massive sales counter just inside the door."
