  "description": [
    "The road ambles through the forest, marred by potholes and insurgent boulders which have been liberated by the elements.  Dense beds of dwarf andromeda create intermittent patches of dark green color on either side of the way.  A courageous deer mouse suddenly darts through the ruts, almost underfoot, before disappearing into a thick carpet of tall clover."
