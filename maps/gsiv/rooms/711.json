    "A sleepy tabby cat scratches her back against the high city wall, which shelters the wey from the worst of the winds that blow east from the DragonSpine mountains.  Four greystone cottages line the opposite side of the wey, their grassy yards lined with tall privet hedge.  From within the hedge, a saucy songbird trills a lovely melody in open defiance of any threat posed by the aged cat.",

Four greystone cottages line the opposite side of the wey, their grassy yards lined with tall privet hedge.  From within the hedge, a saucy songbird trills a lovely melody in open defiance of any threat posed by the unathletic cat.",
    "The high city wall shelters the wey from the worst of the winds blowing east from the DragonSpine mountains.  Four small houses line the opposite side of the road, their tiny yards planted with white roses and night-blooming jasmine.  The face the wall, and though their view is grey stone, their street is well kept and cozy.",
