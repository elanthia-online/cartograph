  "description": [
    "A plank bridge crosses the river.  The bridge appears weathered but extremely sturdy.  Whoever built it sunk the pilings deep into the river, then heaped up boulders against them to prevent the river from carrying the bridge downstream even in the highest water conditions.  The bridge sports steps on either end and a handrail on both the upstream and downstream sides.  Much farther to the south the river appears to join a second river."
