    "The underground space is hollowed out for several feet in every direction from the centrally located wooden ladder.  Motes of moonlight drip down from above, several torches anchored into the ground providing extra light.  Next to a handful of broken shovels and bent pickaxes leaning against an area where the layers of limestone are especially visible, a collection of hair-related items and tools are heaped together in a chaotic pile on the ground.",
