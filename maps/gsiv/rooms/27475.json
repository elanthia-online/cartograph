    "Tall glass panels along the eastern wall capture the breeze, while slender oriel windows of fengite line the clerestory above.  Several works of art in double-cased frames grace the ivory walls of the airy apartment.  Set nearer the entry, a stained rimu marquetry desk and some leopardwood curule chairs padded in raisin black velvet are situated upon a round crimson rug.  Elaborately worked damascened screens separate the space, the rear quarter containing a grand fireplace with a dark grey granite mantle between a four-poster mahogany bed canopied in scarlet silk and mahogany curios.",
    "The ivory walls of the spacious apartment are filled with art in some double-cased frames.  Slender oriel windows ring the clerestory, each partnered with a punctured copper lantern.  Situated nearer the entry, a stained rimu marquetry desk and some leopardwood curule chairs padded in raisin black velvet are set upon a round crimson rug.  Richly damascened screens partition the private living quarters, where a four-poster mahogany bed canopied in scarlet silk and matching mahogany curios stand on either side of the grand fireplace with a dark grey granite mantle.  Crimson drapery shrouds the eastern wall, separated by a frosted glass panel."
