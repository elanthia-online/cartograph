  "description": [
    "Clusters of trees bare of leaves find purchase along a meandering pathway, which is bordered by flower beds absent flora and instead filled with a muck of mud and pockets of sand.  An expansive manor rises up to the north, while a crumbling stone wall demarcates the property's border to the south."
