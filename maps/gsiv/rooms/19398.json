    "Fat porcelain vases filled with miniature palm trees decorate the spaces between the floor-to-ceiling windows that are arranged along the southern section of the corridor.  Tiny writing desks are positioned at even intervals upon the polished teak floors and are spaced to provide ample room for visitors to peruse the books that are assembled in tidy rows upon the various bookcases that line the northern wall."
