    "Ground flecks of white quartz have been mixed into the limestone whitewashing used on the walls in this section of the hallway.  Chips of dragonseye sapphire have been set into the walls at various points.  The sapphire and quartz cause the walls to reflect tiny pinpoints of brilliance in the light cast by several hanging lanterns, giving the impression of a firmament of stars."
