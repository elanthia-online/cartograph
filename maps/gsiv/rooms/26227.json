  "description": [
    "Heavy, waterstained canvas of a nondescript grey color hangs over the open side of this small shelter and is decorated with pins, medals, and other small mementos.  Suspended from the ceiling by a thick chain, a glass-paned iron lantern sputters above a long metal rack crowded with wares.  The hard, dirt floor has been freshly swept and a few woven reed mats are scattered in front of a ragged flap in the corner."
