    "The rainbow of flags suspended above the plaza are tied to a series of belaying pins anchored by a railing constructed to look like a ship's rail.  The wall continues around the square, defining the space as well as giving it the unique flavor of being aboard a wide ship.   Small snowdrifts and icicles hanging from the flags dampen the image a bit."
