    "The path here broadens and splits off into small, overgrown trails leading deeper into the impenetrable forest.  The way east is rutted and worn, bearing some signs of frequent travel.  After a short distance, the path leaves the cover of the forest and veers off towards a stand of tall conifers which frame the entrance to a large clearing."
