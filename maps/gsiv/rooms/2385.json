    "Lamps are slung from some of the thickest roots.  Shelves have been hollowed out of the walls and are filled with dark glass jars and clay pots.  A slab of granite in the center of the room serves as the worktable.  It is covered with vials, tubes, candles and various tools of alchemy.  Fluids, in all colors of the spectrum, bubble and hiss in their glass containers."
