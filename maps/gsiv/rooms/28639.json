  "description": [
    "Something is distinctly out of place in this room.  Several gashes mar the furniture and the inside of the door, proving to be the claw marks of a powerful puma on closer inspection.  In the center of the room lies an oak-framed four poster bed with an enormous puma hide rug at the foot.  Sitting off to one side of the bed is a wooden box with a small sign above it.  A rolaren bastard sword hangs on the north wall, a small plaque mounted beneath it."
