  "description": [
    "In one corner, two overstuffed chairs sit before a marble fireplace, a petite table nestled between them on a plush cream rug.  Moonlight pours through a large window along the back wall, casting shadows over a small writing desk.  A carved cherrywood railing serves as the southern wall, providing a view of the dim hall below, and is only broken by the head of a winding staircase.  The remainder of the wall space is floor-to-ceiling walnut bookshelves.  A darkened hallway to the east leads to a dark mahogany door."
