  "description": [
    "Off the western side of the trail lies an open shack primarily made of roughly hewn pine.  The hastily constructed shelter is covered with a patched tent, providing a makeshift roof for this bustling work area.  Groups of halflings move hurriedly in and out, carrying wood and supplies to the faire's various merchants.  A few carts await calls for supplies, while a youngster slides into the shack on one foot, narrowly missing an overladen worker rushing out the door.  Shouting and muttered curses ensue."
