    "Sections of feather-tied hemp dangle above, twirling idly in place as the air is stirred by the slightest movement or stray breeze like silent, varicolored windchimes.  Braided cord ties support a cloth-lined segmented box that hangs from the far wall, and near it, a battered metal tray is bracketed beneath by a pair of small, forked oak branches."
