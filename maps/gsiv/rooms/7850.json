    "Low tables line the walls of this room.  Shards of broken glassware are scattered everywhere, as are sheets of parchment too faded to read.  Colorful stains are splashed on the floor and furniture, and a round black mark on a wall around the wreckage of an oven suggests an explosion.  An intricate balance is bolted to one of the tables, and an assortment of weights is scattered across the floor."
