  "description": [
    "Faint outlines of old raised planting beds, a neat pile of gardening tools, and tidy stacks of discarded placards hint at the former life of this space.  Now nothing but potted trees, hundreds lined up in methodical rows, grow in the expanse of this large yard.  Smaller cuttings and tiny tree starts cover the surface of a pitted worktable that rests up against the wall of the old farmhouse, between a plain wooden rack and a whitewashed split door."
