    "A short flight of stairs leads into a sunken chamber of carved ebon marble.  The center of the room has a raised platform with a lacquered and padded X-shaped table.  Lining the walls is a variety of tools, whips, and chains of assorted lengths and sizes.  Beneath the table is a pile of brushes and a tub filled to the brim with oil.  Presiding over the table is a short wooden podium with an illustrated book on it."
