    "Several clusters of large beeswax candles are placed about the edge of the enclosure, their various lengths and natural forms making them a beautiful work of art.  A copper-bound cedar chest dominates one area, the wood carved with whimsical forest creatures.  Heaped in the center of the room is a pile of soft furs in a wide variety of colors and from many different animals."
