    "A huge salt cavern stretches deep underground.  Shadows cast by a hundred wall-mounted torches play across the off-white walls.  Rows of gleaming white stone benches with padded silver cushions cascade down to a spacious marble dais over which a huge banner hangs.  Plush emerald carpet covers the floor between the rows of benches.  Despite the many torches, the air is cool and dry in here.  An iron ladder affixed to the east wall leads up through a hole in the cavern's roof."
