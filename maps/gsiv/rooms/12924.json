    "Despite the massive trees that block the natural light from above, a healthy, fiery red glow bathes the area.  A large, open-air forge stands to the west, and the hissing, clanging, and banging often associated with metal-working fills the air.  Damp piles of hay are strewn about before the homes and shops here, and several water-filled barrels line the walls of the structures."
