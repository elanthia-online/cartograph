  "description": [
    "Twin towers stand as sentinels to a vaulted archway leading out to the town common.  The adjoining, thick stone walls extend to encircle a grassy bailey, until they butt up against the stony face of the granite mountainside.  Protected within this small fortress are a rustic wooden hostelry and the grey granite facade of the bank."
