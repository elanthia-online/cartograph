  "description": [
    "Considering the amount of cleaning equipment stored here, one might expect a great deal of dust and disarray, yet not a single object seems out of place.  A stout open-front locker holds brooms, copper dust pans, and other janitorial tools, each hung or stacked neatly within.  Along each wall of the spacious room, equally sturdy cabinets and cupboards store cauldrons, alembics, and large pieces of equipment.  Every item is carefully nestled in its own clearly labeled partition."
