    "A curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a mistwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A suit of silver-chased armor sits in one corner of a dark-stained oak floor.  There is an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on one side of the shop and some wrought-iron hooks on the other.",
    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a suit of silver-chased armor.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls.  Some wrought-iron hooks and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
