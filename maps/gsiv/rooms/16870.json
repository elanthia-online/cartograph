    "A red-bearded dwarven engraver works tirelessly in a large alcove, honoring requests for his handcarved signs and plaques.  Stacks of metal sheets and stone slabs flank the partially curtained opening.  Wrought iron racks house numerous miniature potted luminescent toadstools, providing ample illumination."
