  "description": [
    "An antique mirror, framed in gold filigree, graces the entire length of the eastern wall in this corridor.  Light streams in from above and dances across the reflective surface of the mirror, casting beams of light toward the center of the temple.  Ceramic urns lining the walls are painted in the earthy hues of amber, brown, and russet.  A brilliant display of yellow sunflowers in full bloom fills the glossy urns, and perfumes the warm, breezy air with their distinctive fragrance."
