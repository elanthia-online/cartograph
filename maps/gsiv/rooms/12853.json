    "Mingled scents of local leather shops and home cooking waft through the alley on the slightest breath of air.  Elegant sconces flank most of the doors, with fresh candles inside to light against the dangers of dusk.  Travellers in the narrow street clutch purses or packages close to defend against the shadier characters among them.",

Elegant sconces flank most of the doors, with burning candles inside to light against the dangers of the dark.  Seedy characters linger in the darkened corners of the alley, their faces carefully shielded from illumination by the moonlight."
