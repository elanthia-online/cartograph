    "To the southeast, the turnip patch runs up against a long stone wall.  The wall stands three feet high and is formed of the same type of stones that appear scattered throughout the turnip patch.  The wall's stones are smaller than those found in the patch, though.  No mortar holds the stones together, and in places the stones look as though they have just been unceremoniously heaped with no attempt at fitting them together at all."
