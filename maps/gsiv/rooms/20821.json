  "description": [
    "This small area off the Hot Springs is darker, the walls slick with the condensation coming from the steam arising off the mud.  The thick mud oozing over you at first makes you squirm, but then the heat and mud seeps into your body relaxing you.  The bubbling mud seems to revitalize you, bringing a smile of contentment to your face."
