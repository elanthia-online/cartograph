    "You find yourself in a small roughly hewn stone room.  Moss and lichen carpet the walls and floor, giving the area a musty scent.  In the south corner of the room you see some moss covered stairs heading down into the gloom, the sound of dripping water echoing up to you.  A rusty iron ladder leads up through the ceiling into darkness."
