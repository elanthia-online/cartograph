    "Brightly lit by the hundreds of candles that line the rafters, the small room is tidy and lined from floor to ceiling with shelves.  Each shelf holds a variety of items used for scrying, as well as several tomes of lore.  A simple desk is set in the center of the room and has a plush chair set behind it.  A quaint white oak door stands slightly ajar and leads to the Lore Circle, while a dark pine door leads to a small clearing at the back of the cottage."
