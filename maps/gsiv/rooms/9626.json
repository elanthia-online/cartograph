  "description": [
    "The large, rocky hillock juts up out of the Vipershroud into the moonlight.  Unable to find sufficient soil or purchase on the rounded stones, the trees have abandoned the area to a few hardy trumpet flowers and low shrubs.  A cool, soft breeze rolls over the hillock, and the tops of the Vipershroud forest can be seen for miles all around.  To the east, a large eagle moves in slow circles on the air currents.  A cabin stands in a clearing to the southwest."
