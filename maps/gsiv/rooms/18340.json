  "description": [
    "Sky and ground open out from the solid foliage surrounding the clearing.  Moonlight streams in, unfettered by the diffusing leaves of the jungle canopy, accompanied by fresh floral-scented breezes that regularly sweep through the area.  Lush ground cover swathes the clearing floor with soft, cushioning grasses, an open invitation to rest beneath the starry night sky.  Delicate flowers sway gently, their tightly furled buds silhouetted in the dim light."
