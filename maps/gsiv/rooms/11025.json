    "Stifling waves of heat blow a hot mist over you making breathing difficult.  Small droplets of water condense onto the orchids, which have replaced the roses in the arch overhead.  A small amount of moonlight filters its way through the thick foliage of the arch to illuminate your way.",
    "Birdsong accompanied by the soft roar of the waterfall fills your ears.  The road runs east and west here, along the sparkling water.  The air is fresh, and the cool wet breeze feels nice on your face."
