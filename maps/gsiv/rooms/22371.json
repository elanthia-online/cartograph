    "Neatly cut shrubbery grows on either side of the var, separating it from the magnificent landscaping that surrounds each embassy.  Meticulously raked sand gardens decorated with small twining trees surround a blue marble building.  A silver lantern rises through the greenery, marking a stone path that leads to a towering white stone embassy."
