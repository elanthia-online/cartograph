    "Walls of sea foam green are illuminated by diffuse rays of moonlight that saturate the room through frosted glass windows acid-etched with the alchemical symbol for water.  Crafted of gnarled natural driftwood, wall sconces cradle pillar candles whose flickering flames glitter off bits of colorful sea glass inlaid in the aqua ceramic tile flooring.  The musical tinkling of a wind chime can be heard from high above the brushed steel workbench as gentle breezes trickle in from the piazza.",
