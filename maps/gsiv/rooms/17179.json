    "The walls of the rectangular pool are tiled with blue and white marble.  A colorful griffin-shaped mosaic at the bottom is clearly visible through the pristine and inviting water.  Several spots on the otherwise tranquil surface show signs of turbulence as an underground spring continually feeds into the pool."
