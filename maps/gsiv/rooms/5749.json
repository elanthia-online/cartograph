    "One house mural lines each wall along the tunnel.  A light blue cottage with white trim nestles against the east well, its eaves fluted and its edges covered in white scrollwork.  A brilliant white door allows entrance.  On the opposite wall the impressive black granite stones of a stately manor rise for one story.  The 'windows' of the manor provide static glimpses of the interior that is accessible through the carved door."
