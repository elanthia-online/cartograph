    "Numerous grey shrubs, expanding from the shallow valley between the earthen barriers and the wall, have encompassed the footpath as it rounds the southwest corner of the keep.  Narrow and indistinct animal trails weave through the shrubs and out of sight to the east.  Flecks of rotting meat are caught on the short little branches of the shrubs, filling the air with their nauseating decay."
