  "description": [
    "Bright yellow sunlight sparkles across crushed, white seashells littering the area before a set of broad stone steps that lead through a pair of columns into an open entryway.  A slender footpath, covered with the same powdering of shells, works its way deeper into the jungle and affords a glimpse of some vegetation-choked buildings.  Two painted blue urns rest to either side of a carved sandstone bench under the shelter of a canopy of banana tree limbs.",
