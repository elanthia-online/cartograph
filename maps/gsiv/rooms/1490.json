    "Alternating terra-cotta and black basalt bricks spiral outward from the center of the court, ending at the low, crenellated wall of basalt blocks that encircles it.  Dominating the expansive court on its eastern edge looms a massive crimson glaes arch of flames that illuminates the area with its wavering, lurid glow.",
