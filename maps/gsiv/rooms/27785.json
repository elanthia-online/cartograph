  "description": [
    "The scent of warm berries and buttered crusts fills the room with memories of a warm hearth and a mother's kitchen.  Parents hold tightly to the hands of small children as they peruse the offered delights.  One child sits in the corner happily chowing down on a small tart with blueberry filling as his father observes the selection of foods offered."
