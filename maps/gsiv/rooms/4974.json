    "Strange looking, thick bluish-green goop covers these walls.  From within the sticky substance radiates an unearthly glow, which illuminates this space.  Along the western wall, and at the top of a huge pile of dirt and rocks, a fair-sized roost of bats is visible.  An earlier avalanche prevents further movement in that direction.  Unrecognizable pear-shaped objects with a semi-hard outer casing are placed haphazardly on the floors of this chamber."
