    "The overgrowth of reeds and bulrush grows thick along the banks of the river, making the beaten trails left by the passing of animals seeking water the easiest path of travel.  The muddy soil clearly shows the deep cleft-toed prints of grazing herbivores mingled in with the lighter impressions of web-footed water fowl."
