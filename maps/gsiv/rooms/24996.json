    "A halo of barbed arrows decorate a dirt trail, the projectiles pierced through a gnarled oak tree standing tall across the dusty path.  Wrapped sinuously across a bare branch is a tightly knotted noose, the rope's edges frayed and stained from continuous use, the material discolored in shades of crimson.  A small fire pit faces the trunk of the tree, the ashes intermingled with hollow logs and charred remains of unknown origin."
