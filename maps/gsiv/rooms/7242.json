  "description": [
    "A smallish cavern domes out above you, the packed earthern walls appear part natural and part artificial.  It is dimly lit by the same fungus that infests the entire area.  But there are sights here that would be better left in total darkness, piles of bones, heaps of rotting flesh, and things less recognizable, in diverse stages of decay.  The air is full of unseen comings and goings though you feel no earthly breeze."
