    "Swathes of pale blue satin drape from the tall crossbeams of the pavilion's ceiling to fall to the rug-covered floor in pools of cascading fabric.  An ornately carved altar with an unlit candelabra sits below a brightly colored tapestry of the elven House of Illistim.  Twin beaded curtains on the east and west walls of the main showroom lead into smaller areas of the tent.  A pair of iron-crossed racks displays pouches and sacks of various hues and embellishments."
