    "Two tall masts reach skyward, each bearing a large unfurled sail.  The salty sea air has smoothed and faded the blond wood of the deck and rails, although the ship's wheel maintains a rich honey hue, having been meticulously polished by an assiduous crew.  A long wooden bench runs along the sides of the schooner, offering both seating and shelter for objects stored beneath.  An iron chain as thick as a giantman's arm secures a heavy black anchor to the ship's bow."
