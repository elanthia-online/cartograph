    "You are feeling a bit uneasy as you walk around this part of the outer wall.  Glancing up, you notice the reason for this apprehension.  Several of the town militia are staring down at you from their guard posts high on the walls of the barricade.  Though you see no weapons, you are quite sure that each guard has one handy and is well versed in its use."
