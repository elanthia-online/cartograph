  "description": [
    "A railing fashioned from crystal, relieved by golden flecks, binds the limits of the landing.  Prisms of light glint off the railing and bestow a colorful warmth to the carved modwir stairway.  Set in the corner is a water clock trimmed with polished metals that patiently marks the hours and minutes of each day."
