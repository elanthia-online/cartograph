    "There doesn't appear to be any rhyme or reason to this chamber.  It looks hastily dug out, ill-lit, and it is completely devoid of any features save for the image of a giant warthog that is deeply etched into the earthen floor.  Two uneven circles surround the head of the beast, one inside the other, leaving the eye of the boar dead center."
