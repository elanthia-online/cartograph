    "A solid black marble altar sits to the south, nestled within a small arched alcove of ivory.  Many candles sit on the various ledges within the small space, their warm light casting the statue of a woman behind the altar in a soft, enveloping glow.  The woman stands firmly with an air of both grace and seriousness, though her downturned eyes give her a slightly somber look.  Delicate snowblossoms are strewn across the floor, their pale white hue reminiscent of winter's winds."
