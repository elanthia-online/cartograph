  "description": [
    "A sour, fetid odor fills this cavern, stinging your eyes and making breathing difficult.  A strange, gritty substance covers the floor of the cavern which crunches when it is walked upon.  At first sight it appeared to be simply a layer of dirt, but closer examination shows it to be some kind of finely pulverized stone.  The grey-white caps of mushrooms poke up in small clusters dotted around on the surface of the grit."
