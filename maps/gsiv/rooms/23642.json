    "Large iron-framed lanterns stand on block-like stanchions above both the port and starboard railings.  Once, they provided enough light to steer the vessel by after dark, but salt and dirt have coated the glass lenses enough that the devices are now useless.  At the center of the deck, the railing has been bashed and broken, leaving a large gap marred by jagged railing supports."
