    "The muted blue-violet vellum walls of the shop have been covered in shaded strokes of charcoal, creating a rendering of an unknown elven cityscape at twilight.  Standing alone at the center of the room is a ceiling-high stack of gilt-inset glass trays, each softly glowing from the illuminated chandelier hanging low like the late day sun."
