    "A narrow slitted window rises high on the western wall, rays of sparkling sunlight filtering through to lend an ethereal glow to the room.  The gracefully arched wings of a genderless statue set in front of the window cast faint shadows across the brightly-lit chamber, and the figure's face bears no sign of emotion.  A pale granite arch opens in the east wall, while a small alcove to the south leads to a well-lit chamber.",
