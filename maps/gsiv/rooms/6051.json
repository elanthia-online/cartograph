    "The tracks of some large herbivore run up and down the area between the rows of corn stalks.  The tracks indicate that the herbivore or herbivores traveled in both directions, and the sheer number of tracks would lead one to believe that there were many of these creatures.  Interestingly, none of the corn stalks appear to be eaten at all.  Perhaps the herbivores were just on their way to tastier fare somewhere else on the farm."
