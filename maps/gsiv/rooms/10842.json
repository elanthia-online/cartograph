    "River Road ends at the shore of a mighty bay and the sight of the river spilling into it is awe inspiring.  Dancing over a bed of small stones and almost lost in thick clumps of reeds, a small creek meanders from the north and turns to empty into the bay east of this sandy point.  A dilapidated pier juts into the river, its pilings standing strong against the river current, but its planking now hazardous.  Drifting on the breeze is the lonely cry of a waterbird hunting its dinner."
