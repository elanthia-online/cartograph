    "Increasingly difficult to traverse, the suctioning mixture of mud and sand is dotted with the grim remains of decaying creatures whose luck ran out in the perilous environment.   Low-lying mist covers the decaying ground, its ethereal tendrils winding their way in and out of the large variety of fungus and fallen logs littering the bubbling soil."
