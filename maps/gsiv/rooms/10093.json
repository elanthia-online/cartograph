    "Sunlight peeks through the canopy in soft shafts, illumining tiny creatures as they go about their day.  The narrow stream continues its journey southward, its surface cast in brilliant light that sets it afire with glimmering jewels of sunlight.  Tiny spiraled weeds creep among the underbrush, tangling and ensnaring a few unfortunate bushes.",
    "Moonlight peeks through the canopy dimly, highlighting the greenness of the leaves around the area.  The narrow stream continues its journey southward, its surface cast in an ethereal light that glows wanly with each tiny ripple.  Tiny spiraled weeds creep among the underbrush, tangling and ensnaring a few unfortunate bushes."
