    "A few greyish-brown shrubs cling to the cracks and crevices that pit the slope.  They must suck moisture from the fog that blankets this side of the mountain, since no spring or stream is in evidence.  A narrow ridge of stone winds its way up toward the mountaintop, losing itself in the grey mist within a few dozen yards."
