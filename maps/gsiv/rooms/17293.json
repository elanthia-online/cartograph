    "Austere white marble walls are softened by a trio of tapestries, each depicting a different pastoral scene in muted colors.  Several racks of clothing fill the shop, each laden with a different type of clothing.  Near the counter, a set of shelves displays a selection of shoes, belts, and bags."
