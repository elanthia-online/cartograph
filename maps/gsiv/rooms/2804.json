    "The courtyard is swept with fine drifts of snow that reach over the polished granite tiles like elongated, playful fingers.  From the shelter of an ancient and stately pine growing in the center of the enclosure, birdsong is a constant background, as if the serenading chorus is intent upon making up for melody lost along the silent trails leading to the plaza.  An edifice rises from the granite courtyard like a temple of ice, its white stone glistening with a mantle of snow crystals."
