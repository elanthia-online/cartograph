    "Dark oak flat panel walls bring warmth and grandeur to this large parlour.  Blonde ash parquet flooring nicely accents the warm tones of the walls and adds a touch of cheer to the area.  Polished lor side tables guard each end of a cream silk brocade settee that sits opposite a low coffee table and welcoming stone hearth.  Several windows stretch from floor to crown molding along the eastern wall, and allow soft moonlight to grace the room."
