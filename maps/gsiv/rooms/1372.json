  "description": [
    "From the vantage of the ridgetop the land opens to the north and south.  Appearing as almost a border between the wholesome and the unwholesome, the ridge separates an idyllic meadow to the south, filled with wildflowers and a pond, from a mist-shrouded bog, littered with boulders and standing water to the north."
