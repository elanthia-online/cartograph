  "description": [
    "Dedicated to the Arkati of the Pantheon of Lornon, the atmosphere of this room is dark in all aspects.  Myriad black candles drip blood-red wax as they burn, filling the room with more heat and smoke than actual illumination.  A round ebony table inlaid with nine golden seals sits between two doorways.  As occasional drafts stir the heavy air, their resultant ripples create the illusion of macabre faces and writhing figures that quickly dissolve back into the veil of haze."
