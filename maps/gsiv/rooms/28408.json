    "The floor in this section of the shop glitters mutely in a rainbow of hues beneath the moonlight filtering in through the small, plain window seated high in the wall above.  What appears to be sand scratches underfoot, though the reflective quality and coloring betrays the grains as gem dust instead.  A stout saddle-style stool with a broad seat sits in one corner behind a crescent-shaped worktable, and recessed nooks in the surface of the table house a variety of jewels in every color imaginable.",
