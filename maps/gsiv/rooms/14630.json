  "description": [
    "A wide dirt trail, worn by the wheels of passing wagons, leads up to a large heavy wooden gate.  A stone wall curves to the north and south, enclosing an expanse of green pasture and rustic wooden buildings.  Tall wild grass grows on both sides of the trail, and clusters of bright wildflowers grow around the base of the wall."
