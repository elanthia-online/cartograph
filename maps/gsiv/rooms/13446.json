    "The white marble floor of the Hall of Being transitions abruptly into polished black granite, relieved only by a richly woven Ta'Loenthran carpet in the center of the gallery.  Portraits of rulers long dead line the walls of the chamber, each illuminated by a pair of glaesine candle globes mounted on either side of its frame."
