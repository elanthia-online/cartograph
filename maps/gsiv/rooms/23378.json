    "Deep purple silk striped with onyx thread covers the walls of this luxurious room.  Black candles cluster on various surfaces, their violet flames casting an eerie light over the space and reflecting in the gleaming black marble floor.  A plum damask couch rests on the center of a thick sable rug."
