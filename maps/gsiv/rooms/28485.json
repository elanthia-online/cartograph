    "A wide, circular room opens up before you, its pale ivory walls reflecting the bright light cast by the numerous brass candelabras placed throughout it.  Golden shields adorned with thin looping patterns have been hung upon the twin rows of columns that mark a path to a closed door.  The same arcing designs flow across the varnished wood of the door, slightly obscured by a fine mist of water droplets that continually drip down its surface."
