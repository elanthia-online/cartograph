    "The path is lined with white-speckled grey stones that stand in stark contrast against the surrounding foliage eating up the rest of the terrain.

A thick layer of mist, shimmering from unseen moonlight, covers the floor of the garden, carressing the glossy leaves of the shrubs, wrapping delicately around the wide, straight trunks of the trees that tower overhead."
