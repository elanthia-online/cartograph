    "Covered with a thin crust of dirt, the wooden foundation of the ruined farmhouse is cracked and splintered in numerous places, leaving dangerous holes scattered across the flooring.  A few partially standing interior walls and burnt timbers help to separate the remaining rooms in the house, while the entirely missing roof allows for an unobstructed view of the dark night sky.  Nearby, the remnants of a woven mat have been pressed into the cracked foundation, trapping the tattered material.",
