    "Flourishing beautifully in the drier soil, a tall, sturdy swamp ash is disfigured along the trunk with an odd red moss.  The tree overlooks a large muddy pond hedged by cattails and rushes.  Sticking out from behind the tree, a small grave marker has sunken into the ground at an angle.  The piercing song of a warbler echoes across the water, momentarily silencing the humming of dragonflies.",
