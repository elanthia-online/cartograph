    "Set at intervals along the tree's enclosing walls are small squares of wood-framed glass, each displaying some manner of dried and pressed herb or flower, and set between each is a stout beeswax candle on an oak sconce.  Though the candles are flameless, they glow all the same, lit from within by a brilliance whose source is not readily evident.  About midway up this curve of the ramp, a crescent niche is carved into the wall, padded within by an embroidered cloth."
