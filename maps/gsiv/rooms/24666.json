  "description": [
    "Odd angles extend along this short passage and it becomes more obstacled than direct.  Due largely to the sides of rubbled ruins emerging from the walls, the earth here is tunneled around the protrusions.  The touch of steadying hands has worn the many surfaces down to a smooth finish, glazed slightly by the residual oils of flesh feeling the way."
