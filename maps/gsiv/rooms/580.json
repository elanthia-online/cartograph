    "As the path threads its way through the trees, the sound of a creek can be heard nearby.  Ferns stand taller than a halfling on all sides, their thick fronds blocking any glimpse of the source of the water's song.  Rocks emerge from the carpet of leaves here and there, like bald-headed earth elementals peeking up from the verdure to see who is passing."
