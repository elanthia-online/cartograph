    "Lacquered black bamboo supports rise from the rug-covered floor in a straight line toward a ring in the ceiling, which gives structural integrity to the conical roof.  Glass-encased lanterns are arranged upon each post and filled with mirrors that reflect the sunlight about the small space.  Several portraits are displayed upon easels, while a centrally positioned display case offers a view of the wares that are for sale.",

Glass-encased lanterns are arranged upon each post, their interiors filled with white votives that fill the space with their warm glow.  Several portraits are displayed upon easels, while a centrally positioned display case offers a view of the wares that are for sale."
