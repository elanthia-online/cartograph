    "Slathered with dark patches of tar, the deck forms a rough triangle that encompasses the bow at the point and the port and starboard ballista housings.  Shadows play across the uneven deck planks, cast from the thick canvas sails overhead.  Rain barrels bound to the deck with rusted iron straps stand half full in the center, their lids stored or lost."
