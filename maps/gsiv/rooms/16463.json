  "description": [
    "The warped floorboards creak loudly under the weight of wandering customers in the narrow passage of this drafty hallway.  Hanging from the low ceiling in brass pots is a trio of plants, long dead from lack of water and attention.  Mottled shafts of light sneak in from the grime-covered window at the end of the hall, illuminating the dust-covered picture frames lining the walls."
