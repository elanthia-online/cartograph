    "Clear lacquer preserves the golden hue of the oak used to create wide railings and the shelves beneath, which are fitted into the wide sides of the tanik tree at the edge of the circular platform.  Silken banners spread through the branches forming a colorful roof that shimmers when sunlight filters through the leafy canopy above.  Pillows lay in organized heaps among wicker baskets filled with vials of dye."
