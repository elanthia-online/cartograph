  "description": [
    "Here you see a tree seared by a strange killing blight, with shrivelled fruit still clinging to the dead limbs.  Another tree shows the strips and pieces of some coarse fabric that blocked the life-giving sun until the tree weakened and died.  No trees in this area died naturally."
