  "description": [
    "Grotesquely twisted trees stretch out on both sides of the old road.  A slight breeze eddies the fog, creating tendrils that snake through the trees.  On the northern side of the old road is a tree that appears to have been struck by lightning.  The tree's upper trunk is splintered and blackened, its lower limbs hang low over the scrub brush."
