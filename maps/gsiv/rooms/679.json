    "The hamlet's small but thriving commons boasts two storefronts, neatly kept stone cottages with hand-carved wooden signs affixed to their exterior walls.  Few residents are about, and only a handful of travelers can be seen, moving purposefully across the square.  A small stone statue rests in the center of the commons, surrounded by a small but well-kept bed of peonies.",

Residents and travelers wander in and out of each, some clutching packages and some jingling their purses cheerfully.  A small stone statue rests in the center of the commons, surrounded by a small but well-kept bed of peonies."
