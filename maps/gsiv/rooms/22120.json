  "description": [
    "Mahogany paneling greets feather-patterned indigo damask halfway up the outer walls, while an enormous picture window of tempered glass occupies the inner wall.  Stylized rafters stretch in a gentle arc across the vaulted ceiling, the lacquered lengths supporting lanterns that create small pools of light over the various sculptures and statues that fill the gallery.  Wide open lanes provide egress to and from the area, and also make it easy to view the individual pieces of artwork that are on display."
