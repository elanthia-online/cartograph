    "The trail winds between large stone formations, outcroppings of the hill's rocky skeleton.  From the high elevation, the vastness of the forest is visible in the moonlight.  Stretching out in all directions, it is a striking contrast to the insular, enveloping atmosphere found beneath the wood's canopy.",
