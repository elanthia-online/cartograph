  "description": [
    "A strong draft blows down the hallway, extending its dank fingers into a gloom disturbed only by flickering torchlight to the east.  A haphazard stone wall has been erected at the end of the hallway.  The stones lay at odd angles from each other, as if the mason was either in a hurry or not a master of his craft.  Wafting through a gaping hole in the wall, the strong smell of decay is accompanied by sounds of bone-splitting cracks and low moans."
