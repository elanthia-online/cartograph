    "Clumps of thistles almost hide the entrance to several discreet homes placed far back from the road.  The strand is lined on both sides with tall black walnut trees, allowing little or no light into the area.  Freshly painted white lattice arches span over the road.  The entire area is made up of elaborately orchestrated modules of flower beds and gardens, neatly tucked into every section and connected together by a labyrinth of ebon trellises."
