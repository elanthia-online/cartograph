    "Despite the banner reading, \"Morvaeyn's Armory\" on the far wall, there is no actual armor on display in this shop.  Instead, the chiseled stone-block walls feature a panoramic showcase of the wares, rendered in vivid paints.  Hanging above each painting, a large sign boasts the benefits and values of the individual armament."
