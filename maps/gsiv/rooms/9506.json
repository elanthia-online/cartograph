    "Blood-splattered beams line blood-splattered walls and cross a relatively unmarred ceiling in this small healing room.  A few uncomfortable stone slabs occupy places near the walls, and the granite's light grey color in the corners indicates that the floor was not intended to be reddish brown.  A pile of dirty rags nestles in a far corner, and a stone arch provides an exit from the room.  The scent of drying blood and medicinal preparations hangs heavy in the air."
