  "description": [
    "Swaying reeds and estuary grasses brush softly against the handrailing of the pine walkway, tickling the fingers of passersby as they traverse the dunes beside the swiftly flowing river.  The night air brings with it just a hint of salt as this part of the waterway widens on its journey towards the open bay beyond."
