    "A string of brightly colored lanterns are strung between two gnarled two gnarled slash pines.  Lit from within by flickering candles, they add a splash of color and a soft glow to an otherwise drab area of scrub trees and dying grasses.  A shaky table has been set up on the grass, topped with a pyramid of murky white glass milk bottles.  Nearby, a pile of brick-colored balls rests on the ground, and a mustachioed huckster paces back and forth between the table and the pile of balls.",
