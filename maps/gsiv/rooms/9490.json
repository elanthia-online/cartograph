  "description": [
    "A small, entry room forms a T-shaped intersection with larger shops to the north and south.  Occasionally the sound of metal grinding on metal comes from either direction, and sometimes from both directions simultaneously.  Overhead, a large, tightly woven metal mesh cage houses a goodly number of fireflies, and their winking on and off illuminates the room with a soft strobe effect.  A metal sign affixed to the west wall offers a directory of services, and a heavy black door provides an exit."
