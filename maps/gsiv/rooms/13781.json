    "A curl-edged vellum wall map hangs on one of the tightly-woven beige canvas walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A dusky blue cotton rug sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is a brass treasure chest on one side of the shop and a spacious grey slate counter on the other."
