  "description": [
    "A long, wooden fence lines the road going north to south, creating a defined border between the road and the nearby land, which grows wildly.  On this side of the fence, the fields are swamped with rhubarb, though the underlying rows speak to the systematic cultivation of the plants.  One of the fence railings is lower than the rest."
