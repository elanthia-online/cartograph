  "description": [
    "Ivory marble inlaid with splinters of green and gold extends to the high, domed roof, contributing to an uncluttered, open cathedral feel.  Hanging from the rounded roof, a multitude of pots overflow with flowery growth, the tendrils draping down to mingle with morning glory vines twining up the gazebo's supporting colonnade.  Surrounded by verdant life and soft fragrance, several wicker chairs accommodate striking views of the entire garden and the pond below."
