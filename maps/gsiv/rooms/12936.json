  "description": [
    "Several abandoned shops line the western portion of the road, directly across from a neglected inn.  The windows are dark and dusty, and tightly linked chains ensure that the doors remain shut.  A large sign hangs from a single chain above the building, creaking loudly as it sways with the wind."
