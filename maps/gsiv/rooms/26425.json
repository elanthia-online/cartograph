    "Proximity to the water's edge on this exposed outcropping brings fierce gusts of wind with a decidedly salty and sulfurous tang that burns the nostrils.  The ground is obscured by a blanketing mist of deep indigo, sinuously twisting around the ankles of any passersby.  Rounded protrusions of scoria and jagged shards of obsidian poke up from the dark and swirling ground cover.  To the east, only the wind-driven swaying of bright lanterns pierces the fog, indicating the location of the southern pier.",

The ground is obscured by a blanketing mist of deep indigo, sinuously twisting around the ankles of any passersby.  Rounded protrusions of scoria and jagged shards of obsidian poke up from the dark and swirling ground cover.  To the east, workers on a long wooden pier hustle to haul in heavy lines and repair pilings ravaged by recent storms."
