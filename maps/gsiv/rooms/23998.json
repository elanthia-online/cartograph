    "Swathes of gossamer in varying colors hang from the center of the ceiling and are secured to the walls just above the midline, creating a festive tent-like atmosphere.  Several mannequins line one wall, each holding an article of unfinished clothing that is held together with more pins than stitches.  A thick, deep blue carpet covers the floor, and a steel pole is horizontally attached to the rear wall by a series of sturdy brackets."
