    "Thin copper pipes rise out of the floor at the center of each of the walls of the nexus, their opposite ends fitted to glass lanterns that house blue-hearted orange flames.  Thick blocks of cement support an elaborate gear system that is surrounded by a circular scaffold system, while complex pipes, some clear and others steel, disappear into both the ceiling and the floor.  A moat of crystal clear water surrounds the entire contraption, but can be crossed where a small bridge leads from the cobblestones to the cement."
