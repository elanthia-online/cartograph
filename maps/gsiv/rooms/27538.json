  "description": [
    "Water drips in rivulets down the dark shale walls that are illuminated by the fitful burning oil-filled ewers that dangle from support rafters high above.  Echoing ocean sounds rumble down the passage, while a chill breeze tugs cobwebs and clinging dust from their perches in the various crags and cracks of the ceiling.  A broad shale ledge lines the eastern edge, its smooth surface covered with wares."
