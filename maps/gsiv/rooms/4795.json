    "The tracks of several different types of creatures are apparent in the mud that parallels the road.  The deep, cloven hoof prints of elk and deer mingle with the light impressions of rabbits and raccoons and the paw prints of coyotes and wolves.  From the smeared appearance of the coyote and wolf paw prints, the animals were most likely on the run, either after prey or away from a predator.  However, the only predator of theirs around these parts leaves the same muddy prints you do."
