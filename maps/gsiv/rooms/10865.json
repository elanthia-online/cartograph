    "Moonlight filters through the dense foliage of the willow tree, illuminating the platform.  The rough-hewn oak planks that form the platform are clearly old ship's timbers.  They are slightly curved and retain a faint odor of pitch.  Twigs and windblown leafy detritus are stuck in the cracks of the planks.",
