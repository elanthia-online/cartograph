    "The musty room is unusually cool.  Knotted pine walls are partially covered with somber-colored banners that hang loosely from roof to floor, adding an air of solemnity to the room.  A fine dust pervades the air and plays within a stream of light emanating from a rough-hewn oak door.  A large stone bench rests upon the solid floor.  Adjacent to the bench is a wide, solid set of shelves with items resting upon them."
