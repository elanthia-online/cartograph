    "As the passage curves around you see groups of elves building great cities and knowledge.  Sylphs, dwarves, halflings and humans are also introduced into the composition for the first time.  Great societies are shown flourishing under the watchful eyes of the gods.  Yet as the hall slopes upwards, there seems to be a splitting of the harmony, as different groups are blocking themselves off from one another."
