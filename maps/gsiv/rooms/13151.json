    "Simple wool runners cover the polished stone floor before a pair of carved double doors, muffling the footsteps of individuals walking past the area.  Mounted above the portal is a burnished steel plaque, flanked by a pair of oversized axe heads.  A particularly colorful, tall toadstool takes up residence in a nearby niche along the inner wall, its bright blue cap mottled with dark green spots."
