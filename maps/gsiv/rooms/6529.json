    "Anwyn Castle is again within sight, standing resolutely in the northwest.  This vantage offers a good view of the fortress's eastern ramparts, the dark turrets rising up from the hulking walls like spikes.  The track narrows to the north, where cliffs cut off Noralgar Road's further progress."
