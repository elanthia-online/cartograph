    "This small shelf in the cliff face overlooks a small cove of large, jagged rocks.  Waves crash into the rocks below, sending up a white spray that glows eerily in the moonlight.  A large iron lantern hangs from a metal davit set firmly into the shelf.  A small tunnel enters the cliff face to the east.  A narrow path leads down to the rocks."
