    "Candlelit globes flicker above ivory-hued silks draped from the top of the wagon, creating softly illuminated panels that gleam across the polished hardwood floors.  Silk slippers, velvet-lined fel chopines, and spike-heeled leather shoes are showcased on top of a silvered glass display case in the center of the room across from a spindly ivory-inlaid table, some woven reed baskets filled with vendible items stacked underneath.  A large window fixed with a plush velvet-cushioned seat is stationed next to a brass-handled door."
