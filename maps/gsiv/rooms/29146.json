    "Floor to ceiling windows dominate the southern wall, the thick panes providing a view of the road beyond while also provide protection from the coastal winds.  A pair of doors, one inset with a whistle and the other engraved with a ship, stand on opposite sides of a northern corridor.  Tiny scratches in the mahogany floors hint that something large was dragged from this location, the sun-leached wood around it suggest it was square at the base."
