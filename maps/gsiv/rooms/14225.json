  "description": [
    "A mahogany banquet table stretches nearly from wall to wall, embellished with polished mithril tableware and fine crystal goblets.  Matching high-back chairs rest in front of each place setting, and at the head of the table, an unusually grand seat is embellished in gold filigree.  At each end of the table, an elegant candelabra with tall branching arms bathes the room with candlelight."
