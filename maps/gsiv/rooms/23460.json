  "description": [
    "Dust and dirt are thick at the crevices where the floor meets the walls here, but the center is free from debris.  A cracked wheelhouse wheel is mounted above a small hatch on one wall of this traingularly shaped room and a wind-whipped section of a tattered mizzen mast sail occupies another.  A splintered wooden chute has been carved into the slope of the remaining wall."
