    "This reception area is restricted to use by members, patrons, donors and the elite of Wehnimer's Landing, to gather and entertain like-minded culture mavens.  The marble floors and walls are highly polished, reflecting the limpid light that filters through the stained glass skylight overhead.",
    "In the middle of the ceiling, a large crystal chandelier descends to illuminate the inlaid wooden dance floor in the center of the room.  Various stained glass skylights dot the ceiling in an artfully haphazard fashion, each one a different scene of upper class society.  Along the northern wood-paneled wall, a long cloth-covered table is laden with refreshments.  Against the opposite wall, several plush velvet settees rest on the green marbled flooring that runs the edge of the room, offset from an intricately patterned silk curtain in the corner."
