    "The rising vapor mists seem thinner here, revealing an unhindered view of the waterfall on the other side of the dark cavern.  Descending like deafening shafts of silver, the water falls some one hundred feet below the ledge, ending in a tumultuous, foaming pool of oily black water which stretches like a monstrous lake across the cavern floor."
