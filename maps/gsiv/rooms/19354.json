    "Slender ebon veins riddle the marble face of the reed-thatched building located along the northern edge of the cobblestone street, while golden sunlight reflects off of the elegant bronze sign that is bolted to the structure's walls.  Overlooking the buildings of the lane below, the southern edge of the street is covered with lush lawns and a series of cultivated exotic flowers.  Several shepherd's crook lamp posts run in a solid line from east to west, their dormant lanterns glistening in the sunlight.",
