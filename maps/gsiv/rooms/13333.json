    "The Ramble threads between low stone walls holding the prolific blooms of garden beds at bay.  Clouds of butterflies float over the flowers and squirrels scamper in leaps between the trunks of ornamental trees.  The lane travels steadily upward to the north, skirting the base of a landscaped hill dotted with statuary and graceful homes.",
