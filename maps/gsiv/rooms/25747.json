    "Lapping waters caress the peaceful beach, the surf  creating a gentle rhythm like the heartbeat of the secluded island.  Scattered about are variegated seashells that have washed up onto shore over time.  Bathed in moonlight, a lone palm has been sent swaying in the tropical night, casting a dancing shadow against the pale sand."
