    "This section of the tunnel has caved in in several places forcing you to climb over mounds of dirt and stone to pass through.  Several pieces of the failed shoring protrude through a small mound along the south wall.  Many of the mounds contain holes that may have been dens for small rodents that have long since abandoned them."
