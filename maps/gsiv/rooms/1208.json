    "An ancient modwir pine came crashing down across the trail here long ago, at least a century past if the size of the trees grown up around it are any indication.  A clump of wicked looking black brambles has grown up across the fallen trunk, covering it completely except for a narrow patch directly above the trail.  The rough bark of the tree has been worn smooth where it's not covered with thorns."
