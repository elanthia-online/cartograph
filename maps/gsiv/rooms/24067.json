    "Large open windows admit a soft breeze that stirs the white gossamer curtains framing them, and the skylighted ceiling admits the niveous moonlight.  A black marble fireplace on the east wall is banked with tinder, with a thick snowcat fur rug set before it.  Opposite the hearth is an ebonwood four-poster bed, its green comforter turned down to reveal onyx silk sheets.  Next to it is a matching night table upon which sits a vase of fragrant mournblooms."
