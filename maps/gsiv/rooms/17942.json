    "The flagstones, though swept clean, are cracked with many missing altogether, weeds filling the empty spaces.  A dilapidated trellis leans against the wall, pinned in place by the plants running rampant on it.  Ivy claims the rest of the available space on the wall, tendrils making their way in through the broken panes of a set of glass doors."
