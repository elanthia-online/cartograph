  "description": [
    "The thick growth of rushes finally stops at the edge of a swiftly running stream, straggling out into the current in a ragged fringe.  A derelict bridge crosses the confluence, its timbers a haphazard shamble spanning the arched support beams.  The handrails of the bridge must have long ago given up a battle against the elements, for only a couple of splintered posts still cling to their original mooring on the bridge's sides."
