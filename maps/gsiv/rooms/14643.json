    "This is the wing housing the Historical Society of Elanthia and its artifacts.  A tall partition blocks off the area where an upcoming exhibit ins in the process of being installed.  Centered in this massive anteroom is a low onyx pedestal, upon which sits the Society's newest acquisition.  Next to an ornately-carved archway, there is a discolored area on the wall where a large sign or portrait was removed.",

    "Tapestries on the stark white walls depict various scenes of carnage and mayhem from Wehnimer's Landing's sordid past.  A black plaque with white writing hangs in the center of the north wall, its contents the focal point of the room.  Blending into the western wall, a white marble arch leads to the lobby.  A rustic gnarled oak cabinet sits off in one corner, dwarfed by a ruined wooden rolton with a dilapidated sign on it that rests beside the moderately sized display."
