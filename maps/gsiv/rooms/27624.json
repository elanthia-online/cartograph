  "description": [
    "From a distance, a weak cyan glow filters into the passage, joining the oil lamps in the sparse illumination of the walkway.  The contrast of dim gold against the blue creates curious shadows on the uneven walls, the grooves and cuts in the rock seeming to move under the inconsistent touch of light from the competing sources.  Moisture clings to the passage walls, in some places little more than dewy drops, though some spots darken the stone with more ominous shapes."
