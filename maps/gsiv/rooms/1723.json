  "description": [
    "A ledge underneath an outcropping presents a shelter from the wind.  Ice clings to the edges of the mountain all around, but the floor of the ledge is remarkably dry.  Here and there tiny piles of snow have collected, pushed about by small wind eddies, but the snow is sparse.  Most of the snow is probably released at the lower altitudes as the clouds are driven up the side of the mountain.  A trail, not very wide but fairly flat, moves off to the north to disappear in between two rising peaks."
