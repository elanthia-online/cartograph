  "description": [
    "Oak planks lead to and from the small clearing, which has a firm ground covered with yellow and green moss.  Purple-edged canvas of faded blue is stretched between two banyan trees to create a protective awning, beneath which an unshaven huckster presides over a basket of rolton tails.  Anchored to a third tree is a cutout of a painted wooden rolton that has a painted black star where its tail should be."
