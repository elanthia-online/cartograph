    "Vaulted ceilings frame this wide gallery, set with skylights of polished glass.  An intricately woven carpet covers the white stone floor, a brilliantly plumed peacock staring up imperiously from the woven silk.  The foyer narrows on either side, bearing torch-lit hallways that lead further into the guild."
