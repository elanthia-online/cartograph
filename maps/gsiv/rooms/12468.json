    "Butterfly Lane takes its name from the handcrafted mosaic stained glass found throughout the avenue.  Bright and cheery colors, just like those of the road's namesake, are inlaid into the surface of the street, set into benches on the sidewalks, and splash vivid hues about from the lamps hanging off the fronts of houses."
