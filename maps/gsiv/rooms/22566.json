    "The canvas walls of this large tent reflect the lanternlight, creating an oasis within the dreariness that is the Mire.  Near the tent flap, a brass wire bin stands, containing an odd mix of merchandise.  Further back in the tent, a modwir weapon rack bears an assortment of weapons, and at the back of the tent, some free-standing shelves hold a variety of garments and armor.",
