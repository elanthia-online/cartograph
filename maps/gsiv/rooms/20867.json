    "Silver plates, urns, and utensils glitter from the stunningly crafted shelves and cases lining the walls.  An immense, deeply polished mahogany table dominates the center of the room, covered in a rare black spidersilk lace cloth.  Blue fire torches line the walls, their sconces wrought from pure gleaming silver."
