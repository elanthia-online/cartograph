    "The trail ends in a circular glade ringed by a wall of trees so thick, they are impassible to any direction other than north.  Between the trees, a growth of small painted ferns is dappled by sunlight, their fronds waving delicately in what little breeze can penetrate the nigh-impregnable trees.  A single stone stands guard in the glade's center, its surface a venerable mottle of lichens and moss.",
