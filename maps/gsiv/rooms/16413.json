    "The cobblestone road truncates in a small plaza, marked on two sides with a collection of shops and bluish-grey stone emporia.  The third face of the square is taken up entirely with booksellers, their permanent wooden stalls painted white and shuttered closed for the evening.  Bright blue silk awnings shade the carrels, each canopy marked with the silver peacock of Ta'Illistim.",

The third face of the square is taken up entirely with booksellers, their permanent wooden stalls painted white, but their placements within those seemingly random.  Bright blue silk awnings shade the bookbinders and resellers, each canopy marked with the silver peacock of Ta'Illistim."
