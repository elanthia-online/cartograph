    "The scent of smoldering ashes lingers within the humid room, emanating from melted lumps of wax centered upon the stone table dominating the area.  Warped wooden shelves line the windowless walls, leaving dusty books and scrolls leaning precariously towards the stained sanguine marble floor.  Scattered about the room are shards of crushed chalk, the powder mixed with unknown substances haphazardly spilled from wall to ceiling."
