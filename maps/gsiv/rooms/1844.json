    "The view from the tower is spectacular.  The city is spread out before you, huddled in a valley beneath the great mountain Stormbrow.  Far to the northeast, beyond the walls, the sky is lit with a dim, red glow.  To the northwest, you see only mist.  A white glaes statue of a dwarf stands tall on a podium, gazing over the town.",
