    "A group of tall dark stones are gathered together in a rough half-circle among the tanik trees.  The stones, angular and covered with lichen, lean against each other precariously.  The pattern formed by the stones seems too consistent to be a matter of chance, but too irregular to have been placed by design.  Through the trees you can see the glitter of moonlight on the lake to the east.",
