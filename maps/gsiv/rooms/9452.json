    "A series of tunnels branch off from this larger cavern, leading to numerous shops.  The smooth rock walls have been coated with a reflective metallic paint, augmenting the illumination provided by a few luminescent toadstools.  Occasionally, a dwarven janitor passes through, sweeping the floors and humming to himself."
