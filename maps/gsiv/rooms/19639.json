    "The only source of light comes from a lamp that is hanging from the ceiling, which is stained with soot.  In the center of the room, a ring of various sized crates, boxes and barrels creates a temporary arena.  The bare wooden floor is slightly water-damaged and stained a dark red, with several planks of wood differing from the rest."
