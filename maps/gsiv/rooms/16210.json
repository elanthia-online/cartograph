  "description": [
    "Algae partially covers the surface of an overflowing rain barrel set in the corner of the stone parapet.  Along the side of the crenellated wall, small stone stepping blocks are placed sporadically, allowing for a better view of the surrounding land.  Seated on the edge of the parapet is the lower half of a skeleton, as if its owner had taken a rest overlooking the courtyard, still partially dressed in rotting armor."
