    "This steeply curved ledge winds around an ice-slicked bend and ends against the side of an uneven stone spire.  The craggy tops of other spires can be seen beyond it, forming a nearly straight line.  Where the spire and the mountainside meet, a long dark crevice looks wide enough to provide shelter."
