    "A pair of stained glass windows illuminates the small chamber with motes of soft color, paler tones of the peacock-crested banner that stretches in between them.  A desk crafted from thick slabs of midnight-hued marble sits imposingly in the center, its surface orderly and pristine.  Censers of polished bronze hang from tall stands at either side of the room, filling the small chamber with an earthy fragrance."
