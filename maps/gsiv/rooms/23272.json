    "Torches illuminate a row of suits of full plate armor that stand like sentinels along the landing.  To the west, a series of narrow mullioned bay windows that enclose a polished oak bench offer an expansive view of the remote trail that connects Wehnimer's Landing and Icemule Trace.  A few sheets of parchment and a scattering of mithril figures, arrayed for battle atop a painted map, rest upon a narrow table at one end of the landing.  A bookcase stands nearby, filled with leather-bound volumes and additional maps."
