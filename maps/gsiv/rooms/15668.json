    "[Soaring Falcon Room]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Walls of dark granite paneled in fragrant cedar encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a soaring falcon hangs along one wall, opposite a low-burning hearth.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the sweet scent of lavender rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its dark linen snugly tucked."
