    "An oppressive heat fills the room, bearing down on everything within the walls even as it rises from a rectangular grate in the center of the floor.  Over the grate hangs a series of rusted iron hooks, upon which the shop's wares are displayed.  A large brass-framed painting has been mounted on the wall opposite the door."
