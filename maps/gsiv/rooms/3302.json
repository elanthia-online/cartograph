    "The room is lit by dozens of torches and marble dais is set at the end of the chamber atop stone altar.  The dais has gold and platinum inlays along the top with veins of silver twisted down the supports of the base.  Several stools are arranged in rows in front of the altar, with a path large enough to walk down the center of the room to the altar.  Behind the dais is a dark alcove with a life-sized statue of Amasalen, servant of Luukos."
