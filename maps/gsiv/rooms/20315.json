  "description": [
    "Several discarded, broken mining tools lay in a heap near the edge of a steeply graded slope, a rust-colored circle of mud, devoid of plants, splaying out around them.  The remainder of the shoreline is crowded with black gum, which spill into the water to mix with larger stands of bald cypress trees draped with gray-green moss."
