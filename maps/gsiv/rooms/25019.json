    "Baskets of rotten fruit and vegetables are scattered amongst the remains of shattered shields, the sweet decaying scent attracting a swarm of tiny gnats clouding the area in pinpoints of black.  Other provisions collect dust and mud next to a trio of iron-bound barrels, their lids pried open but their contents of unknown origin, seeping down each side in thick trails of slime and blood.  The skeletal remains of a rodent lay against the furthest barrel, its paws wrapped around a hunk of molding cheese."
