    "Grey-green serpentine rock streaked with white quartz and flecked with silvery mica is carved to form a low three-sided wall resembling a leafy bower.  Ivy-twined poles at the four corner points shoot up to suspend a canopy of sheer gossamer, and the fabric shimmers with a ghostly glow in the moonlight.  Two baskets of draping fragrant jasmine add just the right touch to the peaceful setting.",

Ivy-twined poles at the four corner points shoot up to suspend a canopy of sheer gossamer.  Two baskets of draping fragrant jasmine add just the right touch to the peaceful setting.  From this vantage point, several other arbors are visible across the wide meadow, as is the narrow ridge of trees that hides the ascent out of the canyon."
