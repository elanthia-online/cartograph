  "description": [
    "Heavy fishing rope sections off a small porch area at the back of the shop.  Refreshing drinks sit on a small birch table with fish-shaped legs next to an intricately knotted hammock that stretches from the side of the building to a tall piling.  The moist river air cools the area as the water beneath moves with hypnotic rhythm.  Tiny river birds dance in the air as they snatch up the various insects drawn to the area."
