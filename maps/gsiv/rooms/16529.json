    "The broad sweep of the patterned floor is interrupted by a carved ivory lighthouse.  Halfway to the skylight-set ceiling, a Four Winds Isle map hangs on one of the smooth mistwood walls.  A floral-etched ceramic case and a long mistwood counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
