    "An enterprising young child has set up a stand on the street corner.  Scrawled crudely on a rough wooden sign attached to the makeshift booth is a picture of a fruit basket and an icicle.  Several vials sit on the counter filled with different flavorings, while a string holding quite a few icicles hangs across the low store front."
