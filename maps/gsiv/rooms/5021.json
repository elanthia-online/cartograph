    "The sea of tall grass that extends as far as the eye can see to the north and east ends in a wooded hillside that slopes down into a vegetation-choked valley.  A few head-sized stones have been set at the edge of the woods in an oddly unnatural pattern, as if placed there to leave some unknown message or to mark the way."
