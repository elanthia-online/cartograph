    "Dark bands of color weep down the southern slope of the Geyser Flats.  A black pool sits at the center of the concentric rings of tone, its surface as still as a mirror.  Mist sweeps from the surface of the water, betraying its elevated temperature.",
    "Vivid bands of sienna color weep down the southern slope of the Geyser Flats.  Contrasting the rust hues is a pool of deepest blue.  It sits in the center of the concentric rings of color, its surface as still as a mirror.  Mist sweeps from the surface of the water, betraying its elevated temperature."
