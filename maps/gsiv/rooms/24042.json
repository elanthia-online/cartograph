    "High and airy, this elegant room seems designed for comfort and relaxation.  Several large cushions of the softest silk lie scattered before a white marble fireplace, above which is set a silver looking-glass framed by carvings of woodland sprites.  The carved sprites continue their frolic on a low bar to one side, which is flanked by twin blue and scarlet banners.  A moonglae opal medallion set above the entry arch glimmers in the light."
