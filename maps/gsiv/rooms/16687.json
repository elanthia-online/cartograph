    "Two giant palm trees rise from pots at the back corners of the room, their glossy leaves just brushing against the ceiling.  Between the trees a faded hammock has been tied at each end to both trunks.  Around the room heaps of silken pillows are scattered between rolled up rugs and tall statues, all haphazardly displayed for purchasers perusal pleasure."
