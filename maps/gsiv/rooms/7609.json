  "description": [
    "A long, gently sloping ramp made of polished stone leads down to the restless waves of the sea.  Once used to drag boats into and out of the waters, it stands abandoned.  A series of rings set alongside the ramp shows where ropes were used to lever the heavy skiffs onto the ramp."
