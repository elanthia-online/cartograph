    "The cold in the air shows itself with every breath, and the leaves of the ironwood are encased in ice.  From its branches hangs an emaciated man in a jester's suit of black and purple.  He hangs upside-down, lanky arms dangling to scrape his knuckles against the frosted dirt.  Nearby stands a shirtless elf, his torso a play of cuts, one crisscrossing the other.  In one hand, the elf holds a long knife, and in the other hand, he holds the jester's hat.  The jester giggles between whimpering, tortured cries.",
    "Steam rises from crevices in the dark earth, making the air swelter and the leaves on the ironwood here withered.  The air ripples with the heat, creating a dizzying distortion.  From the tree hangs an elf, his arms splayed and affixed to branches, his weight left to bear on his ribcage.  Nearby is an emaciated man in a jester's suit of black and purple.  His thin lips stretch in a raucous grin of crooked teeth.  A long knife in the merryman's spidery digits jabs at the elf as the jester sways and giggles."
