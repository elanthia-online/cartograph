    "Charcoal fingers of ash paint a black graffiti over the sandstone walls.  It mars a mural in once-vivid ahmdir blue, a stark depiction of a humanoid with a bronze serpent head towering over a slithering sea of selshis bodies.  Broken lanterns litter the tiled floor, their shattered glass sparking with angry rainbows in the daylight blazing through a narrow window above."
