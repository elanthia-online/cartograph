    "A flat expanse of reddish-black mud follows the road on both sides, trying vainly to suck the few remaining cobblestones down into its dank depths.  In several spots the mud has actually dried a bit, and large cracks crisscross the surface of the swamp, breaking each patch into multisided plates.  A slight fog rises from the swampy ground, merely a mist that causes the ground further away to appear to waver slightly."
