    "Strange stones spread out from the island to the east and partially block the water course, their round and smooth surfaces speckled with sand and salt water.  To the west, a small swimming area is roped off by a series of blown glass globes, beyond which is a long beach whose sands glitter beneath the attention of the moon."
