    "The main showroom of this quickly built shop is packed with goods for sale.  Near the interior of the door, a stack of unopened crates lies in wait to replenish the items as customers mingle and supplies grow low.  On a low-set rafter, a small tapestry is hung depicting in colorful detail various symbols of the pantheon of Elanthian Arkati.  A short glass display occupies the eastern wall, while a sturdy shelf has been built cater-cornered in the northwest part of the room."
