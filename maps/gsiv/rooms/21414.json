  "description": [
    "Thick planks of dusky oak create a sturdy platform that stretches across the clearing and protects guests from the sucking mud of the mire.  Colorful streams stretch through the thick boughs of the surrounding banyans, while colorful awnings provide a bit of shelter from the elements along the eastern edges.  Several tables and benches provide a common area for folks to gather and share the various foods offered by the local venders."
