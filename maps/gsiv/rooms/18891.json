  "description": [
    "The sound of dripping water echoes off of the rough walls of the cave.  Large torches burn wildly, causing shadows to dance across the uneven stone surfaces.  A few steps lead up to an old altar that stands against one wall.  In the other direction, the light fades away into a deep, dark cavern.  Small mirrors are scattered along the wall of a large shaft that leads upward into blackness, and one large mirror is suspended just above the rock floor directly underneath the shaft."
