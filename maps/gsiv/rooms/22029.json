    "Fresh as a country meadow, this cozy room welcomes you.  Pale green linens cover a brass bed, their color echoed in simple cotton curtains patterned with meadow flowers.  Painted carvings of herbs decorate the cream colored walls.  An armoire, crafted of rare varin stands in one corner, complementing the antique nightstands at bedside.  Opposite the bed, two cushioned chairs flank a brick fireplace.  A pot of fresh herbs, simmering over a small fire, fills the air with a fresh scent."
