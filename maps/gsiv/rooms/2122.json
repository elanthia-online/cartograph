    "Fountains of flame and lava light up the night sky all along the ridgeline to the east and west.  The land to the south is cloaked in darkness, but downslope to the north the blackened land is lit by glowing ribbons of orange lava.",
    "Fountains of flame and lava form a solid wall of fire that stretches to the east and west.  The erupting fissure is just north of the ridge so the land to the south has been spared, but downslope to the north is a wasteland of charred devastation.  The blackened landscape is a nightmare of criss-crossed lava channels, cooling basalt, and vegetation burned to ash."
