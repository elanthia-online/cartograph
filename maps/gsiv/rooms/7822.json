  "description": [
    "There are no bushes here -- the cold and altitude keep such plants to the lower slopes.  A variety of mosses and lichens spread over the bare rock faces, wherever the thin soil has been stripped away by the wind.  Upslope, you notice a large dark spot on the side of the mountain."
