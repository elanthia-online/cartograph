    "Spacious and comfortable, this room boasts multiple amenities for the weary adventurer.  Underfoot, a tiled map of Torre allows wanderers to reflect on their travels.  In the center of the room, planters of palms and tropical foliage screen a large tiled pool encircled with rattan chairs organized in intimate groupings.  Taking up the entirety of the far wall, an intricately carved bar lined with multiple small stools lies in wait of parched throats and hungry bellies alike."
