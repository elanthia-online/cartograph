    "Some slabs of freshly butchered meat hang from hooks in the back.  A long counter sits off to the side, its surface somewhat clean though noticably used to present bloodied meat during the day.  The front windows of the room are pulled open, but a couple brass lanterns have been placed out and lit to provide comfortable lighting.",
