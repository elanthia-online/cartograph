    "Thick planks of oak, each speckled with their fair share of mud and grime, stretch across the spongy soft ground to provide a sturdy pathway through the ferns, duckweed, and muck.  Faded purple lettering decorates a sun-whitened blue banner that has been stretched over the pathway and is anchored to a pair of spreading oaks on either side.  Hammered into the soft ground, a lone sign decorated with gold paint is attached to a ribbon-wrapped post."
