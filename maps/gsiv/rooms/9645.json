  "description": [
    "The room is bare except for thick crimson rugs that cover the stone floor apart from a wide ring around a central dais.  Candles set in niches carved into the walls of this sunless chamber cast their flickering light on frescoes, making the painted figures seem to writhe.  The massive jade statue of Ivas crouched upon the dais is a commanding presence despite her lowered gaze."
