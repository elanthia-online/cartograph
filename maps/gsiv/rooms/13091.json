    "The trail leads through a wonderland of silvery reflection.  A garden arch, contrived of stone, is covered with the lacy tendrils of iceblossoms and snow-pansies.  Crocuses lift delicate flowers above the carpet of snow, in vivid shades of violet, gold and pink.  The quaint houses built within the garden stand in the midst of the improbable greenery, much like the blossoms themselves."
