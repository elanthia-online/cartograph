    "Floor to ceiling shelves of refurbished driftwood line the limestone walls and are held in place by wrought iron anchors.  Brass lanterns dangle from the ceiling upon matching chains and provide adequate illumination for viewing the contents of the shelves.  A brass-banded knotted oak footlocker that houses rags, cloths, and dustpans is set between a narrow closet and a large dust bin."
