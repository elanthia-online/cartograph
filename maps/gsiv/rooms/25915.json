    "A long solid walnut table with scroll-cut carrels bisects the room.  Butting up against it is an intricate wood cabinet.  Shelving runs around the circumference of the room, stopping mid-way up the wall.  Atop the shelves are stacks of parchments, several small bottles of ink, and clay urns filled with quills."
