    "A tattered spiderweb hangs on one of the mahogany paneled walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of the black marble floor.  There is an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on one side of the shop and a staved-in treasure chest on the other."
