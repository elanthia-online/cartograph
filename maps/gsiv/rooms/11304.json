    "A narrow corridor branches north from this winding, torch-lit hall.  Dense smoke and rock dust hang heavily in the still air, stinging eyes and throat alike, and a monotonous dripping sound echoes down the passage from somewhere to the west.  Above the nearest torch is a small grate, but if it once served to ventilate the hall, the earth and rubble pressing against the grate from the far side now prevent it from serving its function."
