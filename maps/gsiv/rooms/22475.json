    "Ornately framed portraits hang on the white plaster walls, their unsmiling faces silently observing all that transpires.  Spaced evenly around the perimeter of the room, tall wrought iron candelabras offer adequate illumination even as they cast flickering, dancing shadows across the walls.  Resting against the wall across from the etched glass door leading into this cozy space, an aubergine velvet divan anchors a small seating area with a low mahogany table."
