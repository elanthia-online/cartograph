    "Rows of poplar trees line both sides of a wide lane, their tall, graceful forms standing like sentries.  The way curves gently from the north to the east, disappearing into the embrace of night's shadows.  Beyond the poplars, one can glimpse a moonlit hill to the northwest.",
    "Rows of poplar trees line both sides of a wide lane, their tall, graceful forms standing like sentries.  The way curves gently from the north to the east, and thick beds of mossy flowers grow between the double ruts, busy with the floating colors of butterflies.  Beyond the poplars, one can glimpse rolling, wooded expanses and a hill to the northwest."
