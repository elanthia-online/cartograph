    "The path narrows, forking off to the cluster of huts to the northeast, and winding around the perimeter of the black stone temple to the northwest.  The legs of the shrine, bent at an angle as though the huge stone spider were crouching, ready to pounce on its prey, hold a strange fascination for you."
