    "A small trail winds its way through the gardens, the twisting pathway marked by flat circular stepping-stones tinted a pure white hue.  Flowers of every breed and hue imaginable blossom along the edges of the path, their vivid color painting an intricate cascade of beauty across the verdant green surroundings.  The soft lapping of water can be distinguished further north, and through the haze of green, one can faintly glimpse the black waters of a small pond."
