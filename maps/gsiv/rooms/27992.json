    "Long feathers tied with colorful ribbons decorate the thick natural wool that lines the inside of this domed shelter.  Centered on a large carpet woven with several saffron hues is a conical clay brazier, a narrow rattan basket filled with sticks resting just to the side.  Hanging by the opening is a series of eagle statues, each one a different stage of the bird taking flight.  Flanked by a pair of folding tables is a small wooden sofa lined with amber-hued cushions."
