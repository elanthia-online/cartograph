    "The ceiling appears to be made of living black leather as a sudden gust of wind creates a ripple-like effect.  Suddenly, the flapping of many wings and the high-pitched screeching cries of thousands of bats fills your very soul.  From somewhere in the shadows comes the sound of something heavy crashing to the earth."
