    "Cots covered in soft blankets line the walls of this cozy, darkened room.  A merry fire dances in a small fireplace opposite the door.  From an iron pot dangling over the fire, a foul-smelling concoction bubbles over.  An ancient-looking elven woman bustles about, herbs bursting from her apron pockets and bandages dangling from her arms."
