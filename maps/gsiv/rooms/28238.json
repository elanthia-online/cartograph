  "description": [
    "This long, narrow dirt road presses between several buildings, connecting one of the quieter corners of this part of town with the main thoroughfares, where small residences and humble shops give way to the larger emporia, offices and grander structures.  A heavy iron-banded door has been set into a high wall of the town barracks."
