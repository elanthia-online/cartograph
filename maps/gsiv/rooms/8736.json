    "Deep green hedges line the west side of the cobblestone road, bordering the wooden townhouses that overlook the river.  Gulls squawk from their nests along the edge of the bridge to the north, complaining at the ships that pass below.  A painted wooden boardwalk lies along the water to the east, and a side street leads west up the riverbank."
