    "Dusty shelves filled with books line the wall behind a wooden counter crowded with stools.  Below a curtained window, an oil-filled lamp with a soot-smudged glass globe rests on a writing desk cluttered with parchment and ink-stained quills.  A stack of crates scrawled with various ports of call blocks the view into the rear of the wagon."
