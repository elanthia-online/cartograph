    "Surrounded by verdant greenery, the small clearing is devoid of grass and has a crackling cook fire set within a ring of stones at its heart.  Several burly men attend to the fire, their chests and faces glistening with sweat.  A dressed and spiced roasting velnalin slowly turns on a spit over the fire, its gristle popping noisily as it drips into the flames."
