    "Sculptured copper, nickle, iron and lead ores are shaped to best display the many convoluted layers, folds, and twists of rock that make up the walls of this chamber.  The altar of this shrine is a large cylinder of burnished bronze topped by a burning oil lamp and the walls of the room are pockmarked with scores of small niches to hold the offerings."
