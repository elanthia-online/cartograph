  "description": [
    "Standing opposite the dark green curtain-lined archway is an enormous window that looks out upon the guild's colorful gardens and is framed by white shutters.  Positioned beneath the window is a white-washed cedar workbench that runs from wall to wall and houses several alchemical devices.  A small riverstone hearth is built high up in the eastern wall, while the western wall houses a long storage cupboard."
