    "Large porous stones create a sizeable structure filled with narrow crevices and gaps on one side of the aquarium's segment.  Fish, large and small, dart in and out of the rocky outcroppings, and large crustaceans work constantly to clean its edges.  A small saw-nosed shark rests on the ceiling portion of the glass, offering a clear view of its wide, flat underside."
