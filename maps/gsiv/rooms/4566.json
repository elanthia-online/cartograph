  "description": [
    "On the highest point of this peak, an uneven half ring of ice-coated stone spires makes a sheltered spot.  To the south, the elongated green rectangle of the Emerald Forest stretches out from the bottom of the foothills into the purple haze of distance.  At your feet, almost hidden by the overlapping of two spires, a large hole leads back into a darkened recess."
