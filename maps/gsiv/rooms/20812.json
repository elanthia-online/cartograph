    "Strains of soft music are heard from one of the many splendid music boxes on display as you enter this room.  The highly polished oak floor reflects light from crystal shaded lamps hanging from the high ceiling, while comfortable chairs and couches are grouped around a beautiful golden harp.  Musical instruments are displayed on top of a cabinet, and a splendid set of bagpipes hangs above it on the wall, just waiting for a spirited player.",
    "An elegant, spiraling crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling in the center of the room, illuminating the highly polished oak floors beneath.  Positioned in the corner across from the entryway is a series of comfortable chairs and couches grouped around a beautiful golden harp.  Musical instruments sit atop a long wall mantel, while a splendid set of bagpipes hangs above it, just waiting for a spirited player.  Another mantel along the opposite wall displays an assortment of ornate music boxes."
