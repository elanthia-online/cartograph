    "A row of comfortable beds covered with pale blue linens line one wall, each with an oak chest at the foot.  The windows are hung with blue curtains that have been drawn back to allow light to enter the room.  Decorative glass plates painted with various designs in pastel colors hang upon the walls.  In one corner rests a cushioned rocking chair next to a small table, a closed book sitting upon it.",
