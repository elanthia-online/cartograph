    "A vile, overwhelming stench fills this spacious cavern.  Against the right wall, the dead, broken bodies of a number of adventurers have been tossed unceremoniously.  Weapons and gear of all sorts have been piled against the left wall.  A half-ring of gigantic boulders has been placed near the back wall and the floor of the cave is littered with bits of bone and tufts of fur."
