  "description": [
    "The short, roughly hewn hallway ends in a curtained opening flanked on either side by torches borne by intricately wrought mithril sconces.  Each side wall bears a number thickly woven tapestries depicting a bronze-bearded dwarf in various poses of forging.  The opposite end of the hallway forks, the bustle of shops drifting in from beyond."
