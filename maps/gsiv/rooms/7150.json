    "This dark, cavernous room smells like a slaughterhouse.  Bodies in varying states of extended decomposition, from mummies to bare bones, litter the floor.  A dim light comes from a pot set high on the wall.  There is a dark hole in the roof, high above your head, far out of reach.  Gloomy passages lead away in three directions."
