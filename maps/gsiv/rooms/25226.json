    "The prickly tips of a saguaro's arm peeks out of a nearby dune, though there is no indication whether it is merely a disembodied limb or a helpless cactus buried whole.  Humming faintly and ever-blowing, the sands are not possessed of a uniform hue.  Ruddy, finer sand commingles with coarser, blonder grit, forming dazzling patterns like the swirls of paint on an artist's palette."
