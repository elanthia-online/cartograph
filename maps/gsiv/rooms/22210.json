    "Separated from the armory by a steel door reinforced by a series of stout diagonal bars, the barracks have reaped the full benefit of their occupants.  Not a bit of brasswork is less than radiant, nor is there even a hint of dust to mar the stones of the floor, which are worn to an almost glassy smoothness.  The curved walls are lined with some tidy triple bunk beds and matching brass-bound cherrywood footlockers, both spaced with martial precision.  Beneath a small window in the western wall, a simple oak table rests amid a crowd of wooden chairs."
