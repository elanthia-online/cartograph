    "Seamless walls of earth enclose the room, their towering forms meeting the equally featureless floor at a sharp angle.  Unlike most of the cramped corridors, this chamber is unusually roomy and open.  The uniform look of the area is broken only by a few scattered pieces of rotting leather armor lying upon the ground.  Though most of the leather is barely distinguishable, one breastplate has a fist-sized hole in the middle of it."
