    "Short wooden railings encapsulate this small open space on the roof of the wagon, with a glass-encased lantern perched atop each corner.  Open to the air, this room is susceptible to the changing weather and errant breezes.  Several squares of once plush carpet, now matted and stained by unknown fluids, are scattered around the plank floor for use as seats.  At the back of the room, an open trapdoor in the floor contains a wooden ladder that leads down into the belly of the wagon."
