  "description": [
    "Bisecting the narrow companionway between the rows of wrought iron cells is a large wooden framing post marred by nicks and scratches down its rough expanse.  A black iron ring supports the manacled form of a rotted skeleton draped in tattered clothing that might once have been an Imperial Navy uniform.  Foul odors fill this section of the ship, made worse by the damp, sea-laden air."
