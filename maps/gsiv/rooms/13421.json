    "A plethora of tiny saplings grow among the grassy patches of earth that lack a thick carpet of verdant moss, their tiny leaves stretching forth to harvest a plentiful bounty of sunlight.  Half-buried stones peek out from beneath the ground, each ringed by a variety of wildflowers and stargazer lilies.  Deep shadows obscure the southeastern path, the dark boughs of the trees overhead closing in tight to form a velvety shroud of darkness.",
    "A plethora of tiny saplings grow among the grassy patches of earth that lack a thick carpet of verdant moss, their tiny leaves illuminated dimly by the faint starlight.  Half-buried stones peek out from beneath the ground, each ringed by a variety of wildflowers and stargazer lilies.  Deep shadows obscure the southeastern path, the dark boughs of the trees overhead closing in tight to form a velvety shroud of darkness -- yet brief pinpoints of light wink in and out of existence within the blackness."
