    "Leaded crystal windows line the fore and starboard walls, and a lacquered rosewood bar stands at a diagonal in one corner, its gilted carvings sparkling in the daylight.  A pair of crystal doors leads to a small starboard balcony, and there is an arch in the portside wall.  Darkly hued chestnut marble covers the floor, its alabaster and gold veins forming an albatross at the center."
