    "The conifers close in on the road, which is barely more than a muddy path winding among the massive trunks of the ancient pines and firs.  A thick layer of moist needles blankets the path, causing footing to be rather slippery, and the occasional thorn bush reaches out in a pointed attempt to snare any clothing it can.  The scent of pinesap is very apparent."
