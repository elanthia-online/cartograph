    "[Marble Tunnel]"

  "description": [
    "A grey marble tunnel leads from a black door toward a shadowy arch at its opposite end.  The air is cooled by the richly veined stone walls, their surface a high polish which reflects the light shed from sconces hanging in a row like flickering sentinels.  A plush runner traverses the hall, woven in muted tones of grey, a lighter shade than the stone.  The contrast gives the wool of the rug an attractive, albeit subtle, silvery sheen."
