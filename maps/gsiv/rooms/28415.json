    "Pale moonlight sifts in through the windows set high on the stone walls, giving this otherwise austere room a chilly countenance.  Heavy iron sconces bearing brightly flickering candles encircle the space, standing sentinel to the wares on display.  An arrow stand sits beneath one fixture, and a colorful arrow display rests against the opposite wall.  Between a pair of the sconces is a wall-mounted arrow rack, and a small gilt-framed sign hangs from its lowest rung.",
