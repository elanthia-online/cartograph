    "An imposing single-story building flows up from the black sands.  The massive blocks of ebony marble shot with crimson veins taper as they rise from the base to the top, as if this is only the first story and meant to support something much weightier.  Two bronze urns reside next to open black wrought iron gates, golden flames leaping from the bowls.  An insignia occupies the marble face above the gates, and a gold plaque protrudes from the wall to the right of the building's opening.",
