    "Lit by a single candle that rests atop each of several tables, the room is dim and faintly scented with sea breezes that make their way in from a single small curtained window.  A plush blue rug covers the hardwood floor and muffles the sounds of footfalls.  Scattered atop the rug are some soft white arm chairs, a few paired with a driftwood end table.  Set in one pale blue wall, a carved mahogany door leads out of the room, while on the other, white-framed paintings of local flora and fauna are displayed at even intervals."
