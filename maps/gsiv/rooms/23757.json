    "The courtyard comes to an abrupt end here, surrounded on three sides by the high walls of the keep.  A number of merchant stalls litter this area, notable for their shabby construction as well as the extreme number of impressive-looking stains and scorch-marks.  By inference, this must be where the merchants who sell more volatile wares set up shop.  The ground underneath is almost entirely bare of straw, resulting in rather muddy conditions."
