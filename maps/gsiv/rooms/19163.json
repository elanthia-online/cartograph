    "A whistling wind cuts through this elevated area.  Near the west wall, the sand and clay ground drops away abruptly into masterfully recreated cliffs.  The waves painted below are done to perspective, making the beach at the base seem many hundreds of feet down.  A variety of gaunt sand-hugging miniature trees and scrub dominate the area, and the occasional rock festooned with moss complete the scene."
