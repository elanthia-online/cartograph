    "Smoky air combines with the insufficient light of free-standing torches and heavy foliage overhead to render the whole area inky black beyond the reach of the flickering torchlight.  To the north, a faint glow can be seen, as if from a fire of some sort, and the sound of carnival music is audible, though discordant."
