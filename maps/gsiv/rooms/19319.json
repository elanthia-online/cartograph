  "description": [
    "The entire eastern wall of the room is paned with glaes panels from floor to ceiling.  The view is mostly of the willow grove surrounding the hall, but in a gap, the eastern horizon is visible.  Each morning the rising sun's light is free to stream through the gap and play on the wall opposite, illuminating a magnificent tapestry of a likewise glorious sunrise.  Against the north wall sits a canopied bed, and next to it is a small stone fireplace."
