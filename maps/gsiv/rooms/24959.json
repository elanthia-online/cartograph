    "The lane narrows into a footpath overgrown with dry grass at the edge of the village.  To the west, an abandoned, rocky field stretches out behind a crumbling, low stone wall.  The branches of a twisted apple tree, barren of fruit, shelter an overturned plow, the rusted frame hitched to an empty, rotting leather harness."
