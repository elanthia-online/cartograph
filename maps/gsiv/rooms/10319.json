  "description": [
    "Chairs arranged in concentric circles radiate out from the center of this spacious circular chamber.  A clear area approximately fifteen feet wide directly in the center provides ample space for speech-giving, pontificating, lecturing, or whatever activity might need to be done in front of a large audience.  Elegant tapestries sewn in a red and gold pattern drape the walls and ceiling to dampen the echo from the red marble floor.  A set of walnut double doors allows exit to the lobby."
