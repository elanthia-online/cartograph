  "description": [
    "Propped in one corner, a gilt-framed, three-way mirror reflects cream-colored walls and a soft, pale green carpet that covers most of the polished hardwood floor.  A painted silk screen provides a colorful backdrop for a velvet-covered bench sitting askew beneath a lacquered rosewood table, the arrangement partially concealing a pair of doors adorned with gold nameplates.  Fresh cut flowers of the local variety fill a pink porcelain amphora, one of its delicate handles freshly fractured."
