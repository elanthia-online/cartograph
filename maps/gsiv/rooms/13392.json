    "Dark silver columns hold up the arched ceiling, their surfaces chased with slithering designs of pale alabaster ivy.  A polished ebonwood floor spreads out across the chamber, its edges twined with dark curling designs charred into the wood in graceful, sweeping patterns.  A dark mahogany counter tended to by an elven waiter stands to the west, the door behind it leaking the faint scent of delicious food cooking every few moments."
