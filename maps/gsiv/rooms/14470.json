    "Hand-to-hand combat is depicted through the statuary in the room, each figure a work of art in itself.  One statue, somewhat larger than the others, shows Kai standing triumphantly over a warrior, Kai's foot firmly on the warrior's back.  A pair of tattered runner's sandals hang from a peg on the wall next to a shelf with a flask of spring water sitting on it."
