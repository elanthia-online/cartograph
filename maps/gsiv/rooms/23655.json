    "Dark green bamboo poles decorate the southern wall and are interrupted where a vine-etched golden linden archway has been placed, its wide frame allowing silvery moonlight to fill the gallery.  In contrast to the darker hues of its opposing wall, the northern wall is fashioned of blonde zebra wood and has several bands of azure-dyed iron that spread outward from a sturdy iron-reinforced door.  Portraits, plaques, and display cases rest against each wall."
