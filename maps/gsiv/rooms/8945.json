    "Several halfling guards keep watch over the staircase that curves around the tower's walls.  One always paces in front of an iron-barred gate across the stairs, while the others maintain poses of rest or prayer in corners of the room.  Two elaborately embroidered woolen tapestries adorn the hall, the only furniture save for a small wooden barrel conveniently placed for the collection of trash."
