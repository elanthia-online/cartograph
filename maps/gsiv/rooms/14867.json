  "description": [
    "The graceful boles of the pines are generously situated with plenty of room for their sweeping boughs, almost as though each had been individually placed by a master gardener.  Here and there, a few oaks have invaded the piney host, their leaves a pleasing contrast to the spiny conifer foliage.  To the northeast stands a domed grotto comprised of lichen-covered fieldstone, its configuration that of a crescent with its opening facing the eastern horizon.",
