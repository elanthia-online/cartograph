  "description": [
    "Mounted to the backmost wall of the tent, a carved oak wine list is prominently displayed over a reinforced sturdy wooden counter.  Dimly glowing lanterns, mounted on a thick wooden beam overhead, offer a comfortable measure of visibility, the flames within flickering indifferently as patrons walk by.  A multitude of cases are stacked on pallets in the corners and along either side.  The scent of spices and herbs mingles harmoniously with that of freshly cut wood."
