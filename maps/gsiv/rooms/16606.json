    "Smooth mistwood walls rise from an intricate patterned floor.  Just above some puffed raw silk pillows hangs a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A long mistwood counter and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet stand side by side in the middle of the room."
