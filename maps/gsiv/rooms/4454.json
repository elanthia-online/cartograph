    "Thick, overlapping deep pink-colored carpets cover the packed earth floor.  Placed in the center of the cavern is a large brass cauldron with a blazing fire, surrounded by overstuffed pillows in various shades of violet and trimmed in thick silver braiding that have been piled atop each other.  In one corner lies a bejeweled footlocker, resting beside an overturned box of slippers.  A box of cothurns are stuffed inside of a niche in the back wall above boxes of laced and buckled boots."
