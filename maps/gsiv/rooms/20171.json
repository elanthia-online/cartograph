  "description": [
    "A stubby goblin huckster sits behind a short wooden counter looking over a large pile of toys haphazardly tossed into an oversized iron tub.  A single oil lamp dangles from the ceiling, which gives off a putrid smell, as if it were burning swamp water instead of actual oil.  A large poster depicting several deformed animals dominates the western wall."
