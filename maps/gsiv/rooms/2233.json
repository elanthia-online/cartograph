    "An intersection breaks up the incline with its resulting landing.  Tunnels plunge into the walls in four directions like crooked fingers stabbing through the black glaes.  To the southwest, the trail takes on a steep incline, matched by the northern tunnels plunging down into darkness.  A narrower, though level passageway heads east."
