  "description": [
    "Cobblestones abruptly end as the road comes to its end as the finger of land slips always on the north, east, and south.  Bamboo torches, dormant for the moment, are planted along an oak railing that prevents visitors from a drop onto the ragged rocks below.  A sturdy oak catwalk bridges the gap between a small island-bound lighthouse and an interrupted section of the railing, while a small crenellated structure flanked by large wrought iron cannons faces the open sea."
