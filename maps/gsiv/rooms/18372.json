  "description": [
    "At the end of the pier, fashioned from timbers of several large ships that have met their fate by either grounding on sand bars or even worse, meeting the dreaded Krolvin, stands the lighthouse, home to the Four Winds Hall.  The smell of salted air flows inland from the mouth of the delta as a few pelicans glide slowly out to sea."
