  "description": [
    "Crystal panels have been cleverly joined to form an impressive as well as expansive greenhouse.  The largest of the panels forms the doorway, and through the glass, you can see greenery and flora of many varieties.  The rich smell of humus and soil mix with the perfume of flowers from within.  By the entrance to the greenhouse stands a shack with stacks of pots along its side."
