  "description": [
    "Warped, rose-covered wallpaper peels off of the walls in long pieces, limp strips simply hanging loosely down in what can only be described as a sorry state of affairs.  Dominating the space is a wooden desk, squared on one side, ovular on the other.  Several verdigrised bronze-backed chairs that look more suited to a dining table than an office desk are scattered around the desk, and a stuffed owl-topped coat rack stands between a small window and a heavy wooden door."
