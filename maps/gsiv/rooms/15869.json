    "A pair of wall-mounted candelabras hangs on one of the velvet-curtained walls, and an amethyst silk-covered ceiling rises overhead.  A squared-off yew wood dais sits in one corner of an inlaid marble floor.  There is an antique mirrored armoire on one side of the shop and a multi-tiered clothing rack on the other."
