    "Damp and dark, the room is constructed out of large blocks and thick oak timbers.  Lined up on one wall are a series of wooden crates stacked upon each other, while on the opposite wall are numerous iron-bound casks.  Water trickles from nearly invisible cracks in the walls, creating pools of water in several spots on the granite floor which reflect light from a handful torches set against the wall."
