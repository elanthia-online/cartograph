  "description": [
    "A perfectly round clearing is shielded from falling snow by a thick canopy of pine branches overhead.  A lone tree stump sits in the middle of the area, in front of a long black granite table.  Shielding the bottom of the tree trunks from view are two half-circles of thorny hedges, broken only by the entrance to the clearing and by a towering spiked gate."
