    "The faint scent of rum permeates within the yellowed wooden walls, and each corner of the room is framed with a russet birch beam that runs the length of the planked ceiling.  Hung from the beams are several hammered copper suns, their thin rays chiming quietly at random intervals.  A variety of goods spill out from an antique mottled brass chest which sits open upon the dusky wooden floor, while multitudes of empty flasks are stacked in one corner below several tiers of some thick mithril shelves."
