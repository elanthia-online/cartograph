    "Several rusted-out metal cabinets lie overturned amongst piles of rubble, spilling a variety of antiquated weapons onto the dust-covered stone floor.  Deep cracks in the walls allow a slight breeze to enter, but the breeze does nothing to alleviate the heavy dampness in the air.  Strategically placed stones jut out from the curved walls to form a stairway leading to the level above."
