    "This small room looks as though it normally serves as a large closet.  Shelves line the walls, having been hastily draped with scarves of varying colors.  Beneath the shelves is a table made from what might have once been the door to this room propped on a couple of barrels.  Tacked to the front of the table is a hand-written sign.  A faded royal blue rug sits on the floor, the edges scrunched up against the walls."
