    "The wind is a cruel master, reigning at the apex of the boulders with dangerous gusts spiked with needle-sharp ice and sleet.  A sheath of ice covers the stones, making a perilous catwalk of the embankment's top.  Wind screams its way over the jumble of rock and barrels against the mountains to the south in an endless onslaught."
