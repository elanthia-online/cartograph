    "A red and gold woven rug extends from the small archway at the front of the room to the complementing tapestry hanging at the back, as if the rug travels seamlessly along the dusty plank floor and up to the ceiling.  On either side of the runner, shop wares are displayed on various surfaces.  A darkly stained pine table stands opposite from a low etched metal bin, each illuminated by flickering lanterns that adorn the walls above them.  Nearby, a row of brushed metal hooks displays some longer garments."
