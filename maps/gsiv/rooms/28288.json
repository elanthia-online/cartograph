    "Several crimson leather club chairs are grouped around the room with small tables placed nearby.  A framed mirror hangs on the wall opposite a carved fel door.  The floor is covered with a dark red textured rug, and bookcases reach half way up the walls.  A pale rose-colored enamelled stove stands in the corner."
