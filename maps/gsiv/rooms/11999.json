    "The tunnel ends here with the only exit to the east.  The north and south sides of the tunnel, though roughly cut, are vertical and flat, and they curve around to meet at the west, blocking further travel in that direction.  It looks as if the miners intended the tunnel to stop at this point and left it for possible expansion at a later time."
