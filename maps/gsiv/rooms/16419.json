    "A cluster of immature birch trees surrounds an engraved stone plinth, their pale, silvery bark contrasting with the darker grey of the unlit monument.  Nearby, commercial buildings, each one crafted from the same bluish-grey stone as its fellows, crowd against one another.  A few determined shops remain open, continuing to compete for the nighttime attentions of potential customers and passers by.",
