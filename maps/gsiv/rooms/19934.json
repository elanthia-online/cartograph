    "Burnt sienna walls washed with deep crimson give the quaint room a warm and sensuous feel, while bright moonlight pours in through tinted glass windows.  A round pool filled with crystal clear water is set into the floor and covered in pearl pink sand.  A stone-wrought basin on the far wall gushes fresh, cool water that spills into the pool while a linen hammock hangs suspended from adjacent walls.",
