    "This wide space lies between the inner and outer curtain walls and extends all the way around the castle.  You stand just inside the portcullis which leads out of the castle through the gatehouse.  Before you stands the massive inner curtain wall whose crumbling towers rise high above you.  To the south of here is the inner curtain gatehouse."
