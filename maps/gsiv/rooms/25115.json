    "An assortment of burners sit atop small metal crates, an ethereal flame still emitting from their center.  In the center of the kitchen, a massive wooden U-shaped counter is covered in assorted spices, cutting boards, and food preparation stations.  The lacquered floorboards are covered with various rust-like stains and dirt smudges."
