    "A combination of straw and sand line the floor of this brightly lit wagon.  Bolted onto the walls near the arched ceiling are a vast amount of lanterns glowing brightly, as if powered by some sort of magical source.  Centered in the room is a large armor stand.  A wide white ash door leads deeper into the wagon."
