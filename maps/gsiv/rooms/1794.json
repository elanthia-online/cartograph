    "The lone stone structure in the village still stands, its wooden door and windowframes long since gone.  The building's granite stonework is blanketed with tarry black soot, a clear indication that the building was burned at some point.  Whatever roof the structure might have had has also vanished, likely consumed in the blaze."
