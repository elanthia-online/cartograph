  "description": [
    "Nothing except open air and a precipitous drop lays to the east where the rocky outcropping ends abruptly.  A few scattered scales and bits of bone bear the signs of a battle lost in the form of old, dried, darkened bloodstains.  Frequent gusts of wind whistle eerily as they force their way through large crevices in the rocky landscape."
