    "Lofted high above the jungle floor, this platform is nearly obscured by a profusion of hibiscus and jacaranda.  Some moss-covered vines cascade over the edge of the platform, leading down.  A series of bright-colored bowls runs the entire length of the platform around the tree's trunk.  A knothole leads into a hollow in the tree."
