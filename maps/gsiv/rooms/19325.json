  "description": [
    "This long expanse of roof runs the length of the east wing of the Hall bordering a row of small bungalows.  Each bungalow has a door unique from that of its neighbors, fashioned from differing varieties of wood.  In front of the cottages are small, tile-topped tables with wooden chairs where one can sit outside and enjoy the pleasant sunshine."
