    "The chamber opens up into a huge columned hall with a sequence of faceted domed ceilings.  Overhead, the searing desert sun blazes through the glass, sending innumerable coppery specks scattering across the tiled stonework floor.  A small desert ironwood panel rests inside of a niche embracing the pale sandstone walls."
