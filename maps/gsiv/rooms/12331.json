    "Various blue hues decorate the passage to create a nautical theme that culminates in a spiral staircase north of the hall and a small fountain to the south.  White birch inlays the thanot floorboards in an alternating pattern of scallop shells and starfish along the border, while the center is covered by a plush runner of soft white.  Standing opposite one another is a carved double-wide archway leading to a lounge and a set of open doors leading to the inn's central gardens.  A bounty of paintings decorates the walls.",
