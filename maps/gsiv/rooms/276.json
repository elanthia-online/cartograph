    "The entrance to Tykel's Arms, its heavy door bounded by iron-barred windows, dominates this corner of the square.  All manner of citizens pass by, moving among the solid, multistoried wooden buildings that surround the bazaar.  Just to the southwest can be seen the tree-shaded heart of the square, where citizens and adventurers gather for socializing, healing and rest."
