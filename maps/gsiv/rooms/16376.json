    "Heat radiates fiercely from the numerous fireplaces and stoves displayed along the far wall.  An open bay window above the display allows for smoke and heat to escape to the outside air.  In the center of the room, a large fire pit has been built, surrounded by samples of the rock and stones available as purchase options.  The crackling sound of burning wood echoes through the room as the smokey scent from the fires blends with the salty smells of the sea."
