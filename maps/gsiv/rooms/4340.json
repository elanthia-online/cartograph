  "description": [
    "The trail stops its persistent climb up the hill, and you can see it veer southward up ahead.  Stunted, small-leafed bushes lean in on the trail in an attempt to reclaim it.  Below you can see a valley filled with tall, swaying grass.  The wavy grass makes the valley seem like an extension of the barely visible dark waters of Darkstone Bay."
