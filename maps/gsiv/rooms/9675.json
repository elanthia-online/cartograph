    "Bizarre-looking bellows amid a system of pulleys and wheels clutter the ceiling.  Lacquered stands rest beside neatly arranged, silk-draped tables, all blanketed in the fragrance of soothing lavender incense.  A marble rack containing pots of aromatic oils spans the northern wall, shadowing wicker baskets filled with soft pillows."
