  "description": [
    "Grey marble walls with veins of rich viridian enclose this rather spacious suite.  The ceiling is obscured by drapes of emerald-stitched grey brocade, rising to an apex around an elaborate mithglin chandelier set with silvery candles.  Looming large, a silver-swept mistwood bed is piled high with dark green pillows atop a charcoal-edged ebon blanket."
