  "description": [
    "Suits of armor line the walls around the shop, each with a magnificent winged helm in the shape of a predatory bird.  A wrought iron rack displays aventails, greaves, and gauntlets that are tarnished and dull.  A woodstove sits to one side of a narrow staircase along the far wall, leading up to a loft with sparse furnishings."
