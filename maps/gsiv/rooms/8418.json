  "description": [
    "Smooth boulders with oddly rounded edges protrude from the hardened earth floor, each looking like the egg of some huge beast.  The surface of the stones have a sheen to them as if they had been polished for some reason, and certainly this type of erosion is not normal.  A semi-circular ring of stalagmites and stalactites just barely meet, resembling a giant maw swallowing one end of the passageway.  The calcite pillars are thin, though, leaving just enough room for egress."
