    "Natural recesses in the stone display various crystal figurines in an assortment of shapes and colors.  A rock formation that is topped with a square piece of glass is obviously serving as a counter.  Mullein torches cast flickering light along the walls, bathing the floor beneath them with a soft glow.  Concealing one of the shop's stone walls is a series of dupioni silk tapestries."
