    "The curving hillside is covered with pine and maple, their snow burdened branches creaking in the fierce winds.  The only break in the forest is along the barren face of a sheer rock slope just to the north.  At its base, a deep mound of snow buries all but the roots of a few splintered trees.  Eastwards, a snowy trail winds its way across the foothills."
