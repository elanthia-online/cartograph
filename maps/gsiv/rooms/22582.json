    "Muted gold-on-beige brocade lines the walls of the area, the designs highlighted by a horizontal row of glass candles arranged on an elongated driftwood dresser leaning along the farthest wall.  Several grey velvet benches are scattered across the middle of the room, each angled to face some lacquered wooden mannequins frozen in dance-like poses, the figures each facing an ivory mirror.  The oak-planked floor is covered with pale angora rugs, the aisles converging at a branch-inked vellum screen."
