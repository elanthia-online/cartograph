  "description": [
    "Gold and alabaster wind in sinuous loops across a dark chestnut marble floor, and gilted carvings of elegant men and women gambling and gamboling cover the rosewood walls of this boutique.  A small marble-topped table sits near the arch leading out, and a mahogany cabinet is against one wall, a heady aroma wafting from its crystal doors.  Set out in the center of the boutique is an elegant display case, the panes of glass each etched with an image of an albatross in flight."
