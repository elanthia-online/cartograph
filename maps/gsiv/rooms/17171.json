    "The stench of noxious liquids wafts through the area.  In the far reaches of the workroom, a tanning pit overflows with pieces of bark and hides.  Containers filled with various types of liquid are within easy reach of the vat resting in the opposite corner.  Thick cords encircle the danger zones to keep someone from accidentally falling inside.  Several scrapers lay beside piles of skins with a great deal of fur remaining on them.  Flies buzz loudly above a heap of decaying flesh stuffed in a barrel."
