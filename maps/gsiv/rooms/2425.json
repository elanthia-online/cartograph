  "description": [
    "The walls of this small room are lined with small, gold-framed cases holding some of Blackfinger's finer wares.  Ranging from diamond-encrusted lockpicks to the simplest pick, the cases glow in the warm candlelight.  A low oak workstand lines one wall of the room, on which Blackfinger cheerfully works his talents."
