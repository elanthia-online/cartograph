    "Accenting the long window on the north wall is a rose brocade silk layered valance that pools down onto an ivory and rose quartz floor.  Along the wainscoted blush-painted walls is a long rosewood strip with a series of polished silver hooks, next to which stands a full-length three-panel mirror.  In the center of the room, just beneath the skylight in a straight beam ceiling, a round two-tiered display table draped with soft linen has been set up."
