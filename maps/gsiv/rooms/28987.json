  "description": [
    "Built at the junction where two hallways meet, the alcove is devoid of windows and swathed in midnight blue drapes that originate in a central ring anchored from the ceiling.  Frosted globes bind the silky fabric in place at the seam where the ceiling and wall meet, the combination of their soft glow and dark material creating a quiet, cozy space.  Small and large oversized floor cushions encircle a low table whose lacquered surface glistens in the ambient light."
