    "Numerous fluted pillars of inky black marble line the uppermost walkway that runs along the perimeter of the circular meeting hall.  Nondescript stone benches have been arranged in concentric circles, each tier slightly higher than the last.  A prominent lectern stands upon the small dais at the bottom level."
