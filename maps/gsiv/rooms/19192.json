    "The walls and floor of this large cabin are crafted of paneled oak, their surface stained in places by years of exposure to salt-water and the elements.  A cool breeze drifts in through several open, circular portholes.  A large salt-stained table rests against the far wall, and several hats and bandanas hang from some rusted steel hooks beside it.  A weathered driftwood strongbox sits quietly underneath the hooks."
