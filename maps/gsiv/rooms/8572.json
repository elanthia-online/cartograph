    "An icy cold and clear spring bubbles from the rock face to the south of you.  A small pool has formed where the cascading water has eroded away the thin layer of topsoil and sandy subsoil.  High grasses crowd the edges of the pool, their lush green growth nearly concealing the calm water behind a natural wall.",
