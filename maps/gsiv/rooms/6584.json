  "description": [
    "Just inside the doorway of the crypt, a stone altar stands alone, vestiges of old candle wax clinging to its cold surface.  The wall just above the altar boasts a handsome frieze, framing a panel with worn inscriptions -- probably a list of the dead who rest here.  The room's boundaries stretch away into darkness."
