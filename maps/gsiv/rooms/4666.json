    "Magnificent rose bushes with deep-pink petals that fade to a white toward their centers are in full bloom alongside a millpond.  The shadows of the dormant waterwheels loom in the night like huge, stalking beasts.  Spiderwebs of clematis creep along the grey walls of a rustic stone mill.  Every so often a loud clanging sound echoes from somewhere behind the building.",
    "Magnificent rose bushes with deep-pink petals that fade to a white toward their centers are in full bloom alongside a millpond.  Dual waterwheels rotate simultaneously as its paddles dip in and out of the water, occasionally strong gusts of winds sprays droplets of water everywhere as if a fine rain is falling.  Spiderwebs of clematis creep along the grey walls of a rustic stone mill.  Every so often a loud clanging sound echoes from somewhere behind the building."
