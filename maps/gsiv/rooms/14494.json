    "Well grown fiddlehead ferns border the western edge of the gravel path, their lacy, palm-like fronds waving with the passage of each visitor.  Several of the young, coiled fiddleheads can be glimpsed among the leaves, covered with chaff.  An offshoot of the main walkway winds in a serpentine pattern up to the entrance of a large circular hut."
