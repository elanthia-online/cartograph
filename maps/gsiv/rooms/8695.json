    "Surrounded by a pristine white stone wall, the rear of the courtyard is shaded by the boughs of numerous trees.  A multi-colored stone path leads west, guiding students to the main courtyard of the manor.  Short boxwood hedges line the edge of the path.",
    "Silver-veined grey marble comprises a short wall that lines the entire expanse of the courtyard.  Leading towards the carved haon door of the manor, some short boxwood hedges line the multi-hued cobblestone path.  Azalea bushes with resplendent pink blossoms find root in flowerbeds at the manor's base, and affixed to the structure is a gilded plaque.  Off to the side, partially concealed by the hedges, is a donation bin."
