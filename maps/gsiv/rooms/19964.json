    "Vivid splashes of paint splatter the walls, as if a group of children had a paint fight.  Amidst the chaos, several black-framed paintings of various sizes cover up some of the splatters on the walls.  Orbs of colored glass mounted on sconces hold tiny candles, each casting the faint hue of their glass prison on the room.  A pair of wax figures figures dominates the pale grey marble floor, their countenances reflecting subtle colors from the room around them."
