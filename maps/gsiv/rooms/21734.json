  "description": [
    "Resting in the center of the office lies an enormous, matted, and blackened war griffin-crested rug.  An oak desk covered in disheveled piles of papers and order forms, sits in front of a large, ale-stained rates chart.  Several large shipping crates are stacked so high that they partially obscure a dust covered window.  Beside the window, three small booths have been established."
