    "A small hut, surrounded by a strangely profuse herb garden, stands on the rise of a hill in the center of the clearing.  A thin column of smoke wafts from the hut's stacked stone chimney.  Oddly, the air about the hut's dooryard shimmers slightly, as if there is some sort of invisible barrier present."
