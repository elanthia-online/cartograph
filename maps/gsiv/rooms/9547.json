    "Dry bones pile against the western wall and slope down to the southeast.  In the southwestern corner, a relatively small stalagmite shows that water still affects at least this very small area.  The stalagmite is moist, and its sides display recent mineral deposits.  Even more indication of water's effects resides at the stalagmite's base.  The bones surrounding the base do not just abut it, but have actually become part of the stalagmite as the minerals have coated and hardened around them."
