  "description": [
    "Bathed in soft moonlight, a large riverstone manor is surrounded by verdant greenery and a fragrant array of flowers and fruit trees.  Moonbeams bounce off of a burbling stone a multi-tiered riverstone fountain surrounded by three carved benches, and a path of round, grey stones meanders up a small hill to the gazebo steps, then down to a dark azure pond.  Occupying the ever-moving focal center of the garden, a muster of regal peacocks strut amongst the verdure, their colors eye-catching beneath the stars."
