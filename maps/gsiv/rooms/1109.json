    "The moon shines down brightly off this weathered basalt rock formation.  The face of the cliff rises a couple hundred feet, ascended by a well-defined switchback.  In the distance below, a small copse of trees nestles near a creek, the trees being the only large area of vegetation in sight.  The rest of the area is rolling scrub hills rising to a small mountain range.  It looks as if someone has scratched something in the cliff side here, but the words have long weathered into illegibility.",
