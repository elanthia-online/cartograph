    "The interior of this shop is alive with the sunlight streaming in from the multitude of windows set into the surrounding walls.  Round windows, square windows, and bay windows have all been placed next to each other, creating walls of frosted and various-hued glass for light to shine through.  Several of the windows have been opened, letting the sounds and scents from the ocean beyond drift into the room."
