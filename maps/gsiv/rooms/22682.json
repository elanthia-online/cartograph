    "Heavy vines of half-rotted bittersweet chokingly coil about the spindled branches of ebon hawthorn saplings that valiantly try to find nourishment in the nearby soil.  Gurgling and splutter, the watercourse tugs at the landscape dislodging earth, roots, and rotted debris.  A constant creak echoes through the area, as larger trees surrounding the saplings sway due to the wet ground."
