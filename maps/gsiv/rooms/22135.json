    "Modwir paneling and a vaulted ceiling give the room a sense of openness that is accented by the scarcity of furnishings.  An enormous desk presides over the center of the room, with a trio of chairs around it and a few along the walls within easy reach.  A large screen divides off a corner of the room, where a simple cot is propped against a heavy trunk."
