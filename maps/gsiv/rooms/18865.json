  "description": [
    "The dim lighting provided by numerous candles puts you immediately at ease, and you gaze around the room at the cozy furnishings.  A large bed dominates the center of the room, and a luxurious bearskin rug lies at its foot providing protection for your bare feet from the coolness of the floor.  A fragile modwir desk takes up one corner of this cozy bedchamber."
