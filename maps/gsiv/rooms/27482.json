    "Alternating dark blue and pale blue panels of fabric cascade down from the tent's ceiling to partition this area off from the main entry.  Opposite a plain black bench are several tall metal devices, each built with a door decorated in poor quality etchings, as if a child drew them, of some figures being stretched apart into unnatural lengths and other figures being squashed down so that their chests sit just above their feet.  A gold-framed mirror is propped up adjacent the row of devices."
