  "description": [
    "The gnarled bark of the massive oak is quite visible here, its huge boles and knots covered with a faint green coating of soft moss.  A variety of hanging moss has also made its home upon the trees branches, the tendrils of darker green swaying gently in the breeze.  Leaves litter the ground, their mottled brown hue mingling with the lush verdant surroundings."
