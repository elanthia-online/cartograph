  "description": [
    "A refreshing coolness pervades the air across this tiny glade, provided by the dense ceiling of foliage overhead.  An aromatic blend of moisture-laden leaf matter, resinous pine sap, and rich, loamy soil permeates the space with an organic and earthy fragrance.  Thick foliage and patches of thorny brambles mark the uninviting passage to the northwest."
