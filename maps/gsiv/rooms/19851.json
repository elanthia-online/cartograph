    "Lit from above by a stained glass skylight, the room is clearly utilitarian in nature.  The only decor in the sparse marble room is the skylight itself, the colored glass patterned in the form of an iris.  A plain stone workbench takes up most of the space, an amber glass alembic sitting upon its pitted surface."
