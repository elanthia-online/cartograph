    "The broken path winds near a tall black oak of wide girth, seeming to pay the ancient tree homage as it passes.  Scored by deep creases, the black and grey bark of the giant oak bears testament to its age and tenacity.  This silent sentinel appears to gaze at its surrounding with a wary eye, ever watchful for those who would attempt to defile these woods.",
