    "Beneath an arching dark mahogany ceiling, some gracefully posed caryatid columns stand braced against the silk-draped green marble walls, lending the room the air of a temple.  A resplendent jade Ivas statue stands central upon a tessellated green wisp-tiled floor, furthering the appearance.  An oversized glaes display case is positioned as altar, surrounded by some exquiste white jade mannequins posed in the midst of a variety of lascivious acts."
