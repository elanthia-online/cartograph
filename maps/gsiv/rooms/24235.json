  "description": [
    "Water drips down from the ceiling in a light shower of rain, though the central space of the miniature cavern is protected from some of the damp by the cap of a large, mushroom-shaped rock formation.  An especially large stalagmite is encircled by a slender strip of empty space from which pale, flickering light creeps up and into the area."
