    "Stacks of paperwork litter the massive iron-studded desk, granite shelves, and faux-wood stand that occupy this small office.  Several gold-edged plaques adorn the smooth grey stone walls that enclose this tiny space.  A half-eaten mushroom sandwich rests on the seat of an armless canvas chair."
