    "Thin vines of flaeshorn curl around the gates to the west, their golden berries plump and lustrous.  An ancient sycamore tree spreads its massive limbs up toward the sky, dipping and bending into comfortable crooks before tapering out into thin leaf-strung branches.  The massive, curving roots of the sycamore arc over tiny streams that circle its base, the meandering path of the water tracing interwoven patterns along the moss-ridden ground."
