  "description": [
    "This narrow ledge is covered with garbage and trash of nearly every shape, size and description imaginable.  You recognize the craftsmanship of most of the known races of Elanthia in the broken shards of pottery, the rusting and useless weaponry and the faded scraps of cloth.  Extending to the floor of the valley below is a crude ladder while to the north can be seen the darkened entrance to a large cave."
