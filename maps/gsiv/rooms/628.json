    "The narrow burrow opens up into a wider tunnel that curves in two directions around a submerged chunk of rock.  There is a distinct odor of rodent, mingled with the scent of rotting vegetation, pervading the tunnel.  It is not a particularly pleasant fragrance.  A rounded opening leads out of the burrow."
