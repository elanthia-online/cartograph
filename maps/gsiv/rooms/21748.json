    "Here in the kitchens, a large oven warms the room and fills it with the scent of baking bread.  An ancient iron cauldron bubbles over an open fire, as rich steam billows forth to carry the aroma of rolton stew into the air as well.  The walls of the room are filled with shelves and cupboards stacked high with dried and preserved foods of all sorts.  Piles of fresh vegetables and slabs of finely marbled meats wait for the deft hand of the chef to prepare them."
