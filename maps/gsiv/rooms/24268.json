  "description": [
    "A large, black iron anvil stands in the center of this chamber.  Within easy reach to either side of the anvil are a brick forge and a tempering trough.  Directly above the trough, suspended by a web of delicate mithril chains, hangs a teardrop-cut crystal easily the size of a giantman.  One corner of the room is taken up by a cistern inlaid with fragments of coral, and a leather bucket hangs from a hook on the wall next to it.  Heat from the brick forge fills the chamber.  Some discarded oilskins rest haphazardly in the corner."
