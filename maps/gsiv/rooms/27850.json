    "Beneath an ash grey plaster ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the rough plaster walls.  A plain wooden table sits in one corner while a worn rug rests on the oak floor.",
    "A ruby-eyed grinning skull hangs on one of the rough plaster walls, and an ash grey plaster ceiling rises overhead.  An overturned mining cart sits in one corner of a stained oak floor.  There is a set of carved felwood shelves on one side of the shop and a badly scarred oak counter on the other."
