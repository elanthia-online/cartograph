    "Unvarnished paneling of coastal pine covers the interior walls, bas-relief carved sea creatures curving up from its surface.  At random points, raised ebonwood designs -- images of objects or animals or plants sacred to specific dark gods -- have been added.  Filling one side of the room is a granite pool fed by a slanted wooden sluice.  Movement of the seawater in the sluice turns a large fel wheel, which in turn connects to a series of metal rods rising upward through a wide circular hole in the roof."
