    "The path turns to the east and rises up the wooded hillside.  Dappled light streams through the branches, forming shifting patterns on the leafy forest floor.  Blackberry bushes grow along the path, and a red wooden bird feeder hung high in a tree near a small cabin adds a touch of bright color."
