    "A row of wood-framed beds line one plain white wall, each with a small metal locker placed in front of it.  A wooden clothing rack filled with serving uniforms hangs beside a plain wooden stand holding a porcelain wash basin and matching water pitcher.  In one corner, a floorboard has been pried up and leans against the wall."
