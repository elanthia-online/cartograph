    "The bustling town comes together in this square.  Halflings dressed in varying fashions stand about, some chattering happily, others reclining on cloaks laid on the ground.  One ancient halfling leans against the base of the large ice statue of a mule, snoring blissfully.  A feeling of community pervades the area, putting you immediately at ease."
