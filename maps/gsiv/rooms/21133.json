    "Both the reek of the sewers and the humidity of the air are attenuated here.  It feels almost to be a prosperous business lobby above ground.  Two doors are guarded by a scarred knotty oak desk with an elderly secretary behind it.  She sits primly, not obviously doing much outside of occasionally holding a handkerchief to her nose.  Nearer the ladder, a couple of middling-worn sofas and a dog-eared coffee table are provided for visitors."
