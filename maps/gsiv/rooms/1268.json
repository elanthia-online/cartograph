    "The dryness borne on the wind attacks the eyes, throat, and anyplace else it can insinuate itself.  Sand carried by the gusts attempts to accumulate underneath the eyelids and make blinking feel like drawing a layer of gravel across one's eyeballs.  The wind talks, loudly, but what it says remains a mystery.  It shrieks incomprehensibly at times before lapsing into self-pitying moans.  Despite its ravings and abrasiveness, the wind might come to be a welcome companion...if it were not so cold."
