    "This rather large cart, pulled by two placid-looking roltons, sits in the middle of a roped-off clearing.  One side of the cart has been folded down to make a short table, revealing piles of boxes and crates filling the interior.  Standing at either corner of the cart are two dwarven clerks, handling sales.  Hanging along the top of the cart is a large banner.  Along the front of the cart stands a weapon rack.  At the back of the cart is a modwir display case."
