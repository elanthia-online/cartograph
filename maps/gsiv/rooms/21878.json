    "Sturdy wooden poles, bound with lengths of thick rope, provide a robust frame for the many layers of oilskin that form the walls and canopy of this rectangular showroom.  The din of the festival is heard beyond an arched entryway leading out to the north, while a more humble atmosphere to the south is complimented by the delicate sound of clinking glasses.  A multitude of robust spices and herbs dominates the otherwise woody scent of the tent.  Near a painted wooden sign, a stained ash pallet is stacked high with wooden cases."
