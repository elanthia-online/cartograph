  "description": [
    "The floor of the room is inches deep in mud, straw, wood, and bark chips, and dried leaves that have blown in through the paneless window.  A filthy, leathery-skinned dwarf, his dirty-blond hair twisted into a long rat-tail of a braid down his back, chips at a rough wood plank with a crude chisel, grumbling through his beard as he works."
