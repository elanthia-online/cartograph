    "The most prominent feature is the huge stone fireplace, large enough to roast an entire calf on the spit.  Knives, pots and pans, and strings that once held onions and garlic hang from hooks on the wall.  Three large worktables line the other walls of the room.  Under them lie pallets, a final resting place for rotting sacks and the skeletons of the cooks' assistants."
