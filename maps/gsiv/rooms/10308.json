    "The top of the fountain in the courtyard reaches to just about the height of the second story walkway, and from the walkway most of the courtyard and all of the fountain are visible.  The walkway heads northeast and northwest to the doors of the eastern and western sleeping rooms, then converges back again to meet at the northernmost room.  Directly to the south is the carved walnut door of the southernmost sleeping room.  Although the walkway is covered, the Rest's courtyard is open to the sky."
