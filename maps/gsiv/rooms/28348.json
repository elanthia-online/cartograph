    "Soft, rainbow-swirled light illuminates the southerly edges of the dark cavern giving the space an eerie light as if a candle had been placed behind a dark kaleidoscope to create a lamp or lantern.  Darkened with scorch marks, an ancient circle of soot mars the pale stone at the curve of the passage.  Painted along the gentle incline of the floor and stretching to the ceiling, the walls depict images of dwarves at work."
