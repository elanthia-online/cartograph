    "Blue spruce trees mix with silvery beeches and golden aspens as the trail switchbacks along the mountainside.  Several tree trunks that have succumbed to the ravages of time have cracked and fallen, forming triangulated right angles to still-rooted bases.  Thick moss covers the upper sections of the decaying wood, while the hollowed centers house birds and other wildlife."
