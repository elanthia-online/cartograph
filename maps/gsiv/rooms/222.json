    "[A Quiet Path]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A stray breeze trails through from the north, carrying with it the scent of lavender and, oddly, grilled rolton.  Though many might ponder this strange combination of fragrances, the truly remarkable aspect of this quiet path lies in the regal beauty of the ancient trees whose branches reach out overhead, offering welcome to all who pass."
