    "Brightly lit by glowing glaesine orbs that are suspended from wooden rafters, the ebony tent is slightly chilled from the arctic air that threatens to invade through open flaps and unbound walls.  A series of round metal stands house colorful pennants on display, their ends unfurled and their staves polished to a lustrous sheen.  Sunlight spills into the entry and warms the ground to soft mud."
