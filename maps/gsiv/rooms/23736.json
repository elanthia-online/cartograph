  "description": [
    "Planks of black oak are pinned diagonally in place by rounded, contrasting pegs driven through the subflooring.  A hanging chandelier, sporting dust-laden cobwebs and burnt out stubs of candles, dangles precariously overhead by a single remaining chain.  Centered in the generous space of the foyer is a claw-footed table, draped in somewhat mildewed black linen.  Atop the table rests a cut-glass vase encircled by a ring of dried flower heads, wilted petals, and crinkled, browning leaves."
