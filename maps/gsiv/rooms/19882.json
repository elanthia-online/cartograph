    "Alabaster walls inlaid with bands of chalcedony house a host of bronze statues, each beautifully formed to resemble the deities of Liabo.  A flower-strewn altar, twin pillar candles each as tall as a halfling flanking it, stands at the center of the room.  Silken cushions cover the intricately tiled floor."
