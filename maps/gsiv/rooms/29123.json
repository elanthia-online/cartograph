  "description": [
    "Skirting the edges of an open-air market filled with colorful tents, the cobblestone road follows the edge of the coastline.  An oak railing supported by sturdy posts blocks a drop to the wave-tossed shoals below, while fitfully burning glaesine-doored lanterns provide bright illumination for the area.  High grasses sway in the light sea breeze that is laden with the scent of salt, the long blades clicking and clacking against a nearby warehouse."
