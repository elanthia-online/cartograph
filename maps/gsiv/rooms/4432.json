  "description": [
    "The shop is pleasantly appointed and well-lit, encouraging shoppers to linger over the wares displayed for sale.  Soft wool rugs cover the floor, and two leather-seated chairs are placed on either side of a small brazier burning scented coals.  Woven fabrics of various hues are draped over the walls to mitigate the bare stone."
