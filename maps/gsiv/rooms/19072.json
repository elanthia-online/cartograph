  "description": [
    "This part of the deckhouse is crowded with halflings, talking and laughing among themselves.  One, a deeply tanned sailor with shocking red hair, sings a chantey so full of ribald references, it would make a dwarf blush.  She accompanies her song on a small lute and her mates laugh and comment on the lyrics, adding a harmony each time she sings the chorus."
