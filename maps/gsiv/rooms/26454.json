    "The sloping pathway abruptly ends in a pile of broken rock and sediment.  Barefly visible in the dim light, a rusty copper trident juts out of the debris, broken and mangled from the sheer force of the rockslide.  Where once there was a solid crag, there is now a steep and narrow gully that cuts into the mountainous terrain in a direct line upward.",
