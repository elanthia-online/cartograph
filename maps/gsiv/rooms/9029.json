    "An assortment of rugs and statuary line the two walls of the corridor, and hay has been tossed around leaving the area to appear in a state of disarray.  Various labels and tags are strewn about the floor, their surfaces written with splotchy ink that once marked the contents of a shipping crate that is no longer near."
