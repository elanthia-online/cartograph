    "Deep in the forest rests what was once a small shrine carefully carved of the butchered haon wood that surrounds you.  Screams and the violent falling of trees fill the air with a strong sense of destruction.  From somewhere nearby, the angry sound of a river rapids completes the unusual symphony.  Little else alters the disquiet save for an occasional muted plea drifting in on the breeze."
