  "description": [
    "The smell of fish and salty sea air pervades the small building.  Several wooden crates of varying sizes are stacked haphazardly along the back wall near a long counter.  A large barrel holds some of the shop's wares, as well as the robust stench of worms and other bait.  Behind the counter, various goods are stacked upon some long shelves."
