    "The broad sweep of the sea glass floor is interrupted by a braided seagrass rug.  Halfway to the skylight-set ceiling, a silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the whitewashed pine walls.  A long mistwood counter and some carved haon pegs are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
