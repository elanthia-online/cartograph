  "description": [
    "Sweet scents and curious aromas waft down to you from the drying racks of herbs far overhead.  Mossy benches provide a soft resting place for the ill and wounded, and bundles of warm blankets are stacked against one wall.  A very familiar-looking patient burrows a little deeper under his blanket, obviously quite comfortable."
