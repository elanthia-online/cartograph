    "The walls of the wagon have been painted in homage to a bright spring day, with green trees leafing out toward the ceiling and pastel flowers blooming beneath.  The floor underfoot is colored and textured to appear as grass.  On one side of the wagon, an ivory female mannequin and a green male mannequin are settled beneath the verdant overhang of a river willow with a picnic blanket beneath them.  Across the way, a violet female mannequin is seated on a swing mounted to an overhead beam, while a blue male mannequin seems frozen in the act of pushing."
