    "A single wax taper set into a rounded porcelain bottle provides the only source of illumination to this tiny room, the flame curving sharply with the currents of air blowing through the corridor.  A quartet of stained glass bottles stands upright upon a badly warped ebonwood table, their labels ripped and covered in fingerprints of ink and other unknown substances.  Drawn upon the floor of the room is a circle of flowing chalk runes, the colors bleeding together along the burnt edges of wooden floorboards."
