    "The trail dwindles to nothing, engulfed by the gentle swells of deep snow drifts that surround the trunks of the conifers like a stark, frozen ocean.  Here and there, animal tracks mar the snow's surface, leaving deep indentations.  They create an erratic pattern that circles and backtracks, then meanders away through the drifts as if following an invisible path."
