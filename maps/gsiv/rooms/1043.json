  "description": [
    "The moist cold slips inside clothing at every opportunity, uncomfortably wetting skin and miserably soaking anything not immune to its liquid touch.  Bright lights flicker on somewhere out in the mists to both sides of you, accompanied by a raucous fit of high-pitched laughter.  The lights move along with you as if held by something paralleling your course, not approaching nor receding.  Then, one by one the lights disappear in the matter of a few seconds leaving only the quiet, wet grassland and mist."
