    "Tallow candles set in tin pans light this table, their heavy scent mingling with the smells of roasts and ales in the Inn's air.  A moth, having fluttered too close to the flames, has fallen onto its back in one of the pans.  Little thraklings are painted beside egg-shaped knot holes, as though they are emerging from their nest."
