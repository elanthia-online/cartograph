    "Glowing a dull red in the night, a row of brick kilns squat as close to The Beacon Ring's ancient retaining walls as their builders could manage.  Where the ground drops away and the windak platform takes its place, row upon row of brick molds and large mixing tubs lie between piles of sand and sacks of powdered clay.  The plank roadway that is Beacon Circle curves from the north to the southeast, dividing the brickmaker's lot from the small cottages opposite."
