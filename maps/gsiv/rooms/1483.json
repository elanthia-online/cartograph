  "description": [
    "Lighters and barges tie up along the north side of the quay, loading supplies and cargo for the larger carracks and cogs moored further out in the bay.  The south side of the quay descends in a broad stretch of steps to the water, providing easy boarding for the passengers of the many punts, gigs and skiffs plying the bay between the shore and the anchored vessels."
