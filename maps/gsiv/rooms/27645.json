    "Moonlight lends the dusty hallway a silver cast as it seeps through the greasy window that occupies a small space where the wall and roof meet.  Bookcases dominate the narrow causeway and are topped with oil lamps that flicker and sputter in the chilling draft that trickles down from some unseen fissure in the rafters.  A single staircase along the western wall provides access to the lower levels."
