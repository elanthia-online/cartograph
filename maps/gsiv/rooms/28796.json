    "Swathes of beige gauze surround the quilt-covered bed.  A painted porcelain box sits on the bedside table.  Clothing pegs of linden wood match the dresser, its top scattered with candles of various sizes and shades.  Brown and tan stripes decorate the walls, and a tan fringed rug tops the gleaming linden floors.  The gauze-covered window overlooks an expanse of white-tipped conifers."
