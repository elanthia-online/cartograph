  "description": [
    "Open to the elements, the roof of the Baile Dragan tower offers a good vantage point for watching the lights of town, as well as a superb place for observing the night sky.  A large telescope is prominently placed in the center of the rooftop, its brass fittings gleaming softly.  Affixed to the floor around the entire circumference of the area, is a brass plate that shows the constellations visible from each of four quadrants during every season.  A small garden is illuminated by moonlight."
