    "Gentle hills of clay and sand form a semi-circle that overlooks a perspective on a small port set against the east wall.  People line the streets going about their daily business, and the wharf looks quite busy with merchants.  Ships in the harbor seem frozen, small figures climb about in the rigging and on deck.  From somewhere the far away clop of horse on cobblestone and the occasional ringing of a ship's bell dance through the air."
