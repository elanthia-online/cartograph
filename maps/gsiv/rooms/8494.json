    "A pile of wood splinters sits in the corner, covered in colored glass shards and dust.  You are forced to step over large chunks of wooden benches as you make your way through the area, careful not to cut yourself on the sharp glass.  Although the destruction in the sanctuary has left the room in chaos, the feeling of peace in the area is more than disturbing."
