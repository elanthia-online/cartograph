    "Fanciful whorls grace the riverstone slabs enclosing the spacious chamber, the patterns differing only slightly on each of the four walls.  Opposite  some arched stained glass doors, the eastern wall is largely cut away to reveal an open-air balcony beyond a heron-marked painted paper screen.  Sprawling and heavily cushioned, a curtained four-poster bed draped in swathes of verdigris silk rests by the northern wall."
