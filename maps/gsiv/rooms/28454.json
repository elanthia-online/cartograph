    "An oval-shaped smooth glass mirror is centered upon the back of the spacious pavilion and delicately silhouetted by burnished onyx and jade rosettes.  The longest of the silken walls is home to a beveled ebonwood wardrobe that rests over a tassel-tied floral tapestry carpet.  An orb-footed dark myrtle chest and a damascened glaes cabinet flank a tiered crystalline carousel, each surface crowned with a vaalin candelabra cradling tapered bayberry candles."
