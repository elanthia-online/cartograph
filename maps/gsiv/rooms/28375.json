  "description": [
    "Students of all disciplines of magic frequent this wing of the library, hoping to rediscover some long-forgotten secret of their predecessors.  Occasionally, a mumbled phrase can be heard as someone seeks to master an elusive pronunciation, but the room is largely silent, perhaps due to the conspicuously placed brass plaque that greets visitors."
