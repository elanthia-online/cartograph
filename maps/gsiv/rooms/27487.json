  "description": [
    "The prominent feature of this dim, compact space, is the short walnut bar lined with some squat bar stools bolted to the floor, providing beverages and respite along the far wall.  Behind it, shelves rise to the ceiling displaying an assortment of colored bottles in all shapes and sizes.  Rows of brass pipes run overhead and along the walls, punctuated by the odd knob or valve handle.  A half dozen ale kegs are strapped to the floor behind the bar, lashed together with thick leather belts."
