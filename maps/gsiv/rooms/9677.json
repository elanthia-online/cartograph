    "Iridescent gauze has been artfully draped above a row of comfortable chairs facing open circular windows.  Several rolling tanik stands are stocked with herbal beauty concoctions, dyes, and ceramic basins.  Attendants constantly sweep the pristine, white-tiled floor and wash the equipment and containers, keeping this area impeccably clean."
