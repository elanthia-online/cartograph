  "description": [
    "Raspberry-hued walls extend corner to corner, the paint's vibrancy enhanced to produce a slight sheen.  The central focal point is a plush and ornate four poster bed with a crimson down comforter and silky golden pillows.  There is a maoral nightstand along the right side of the bed, while a large matching trunk rests at the foot.  Across the far wall, a river stone fireplace offers the rich scent of peat and cedar, further enhancing the comfortingly tranquil feeling of the bedroom."
