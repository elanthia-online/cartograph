    "Narrow teak planks bound together by thick twine run the length of the wall.  In the rear of the room, a teak beaded curtain beckons entry.  A slightly lowered basin constructed around the floor is filled with sand and assorted seashells of all shapes and sizes.  A pair of evenly spaced palm trees leans over a simple teak weapon stand in the center of the room.",

    "The twine-wrapped teak plank construction of the walls and ceilings blends in with the sandy floor.  A low teak credenza with refreshments sits neatly by a beaded curtain.  A collection of lush palm fronds are stacked in the center of the room as a makeshift bed."
