  "description": [
    "The cavern path hooks here, earning it the epitaph of 'The Clinch'  A subtle waft of incense, exotic and musky, clings to the air, underscoring the antiquity of these tunnels.  This effect is amplified by an arresting design carved into the south wall, the meaning of its intricate swirls and spirals lost in time."
