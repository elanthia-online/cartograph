    "Cabinets line the room, their wooden bulk nearly obscuring all hints of the marble walls they cover.  The ceiling is equally obscured, festooned as it is with clusters of drying plants, some completely brittle and others still verdant and fresh from the picking.  Bits of greenery are scattered over the floor about a low marble-topped table that sits in the middle of the chamber."
