  "description": [
    "The neglected battlements rise and fall along the dilapidated wall as it runs perfectly north to south.  Random gaps in the battlements and loose stones underfoot increase the difficulty of traversing this section of wall.  Through the gaps to the east a distant river can be seen meandering through the forest."
