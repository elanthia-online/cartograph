    "A stiff breeze sweeps the fallen leaves from the path to reveal irregular and deeply weathered blocks of native stone.  Subtle colors in the rock set off the brilliant viridian hue of the moss which grows between the stones.  A less defined path, perhaps an animal track, branches off to the southwest.",
    "A stiff breeze sweeps the fallen leaves from the path to reveal irregular and deeply weathered blocks of native stone.  Subtle striations in the rock are just visible in the moonlight which filters through the trees.  A less defined path, perhaps an animal track, branches off to the southwest."
