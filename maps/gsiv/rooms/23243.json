  "description": [
    "Darkened with wood dye, the plank table is surrounded by polished benches.  Wrought iron monkeys dangle from the sea thrak bone ceiling supports, while tiny topaz bananas are sewn into the oilcloth and canvas panels.  A lantern, carved into the shape of a tree house, is set upon the far end of the table and fitted with tiny colored glass windows that cast a prismatic spray of light everytime the candles within flicker."
