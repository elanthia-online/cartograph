    "The snowy terrain descends to the north, curving gracefully over the rim of the pass towards a rocky prominence.  Beyond it, a thick column of white smoke spirals up into the sky, whipping to and fro with the wintry winds.  Above, a short ridge stretches between the peaks to the east and west."
