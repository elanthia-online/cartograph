    "The silvery sky illuminates the slope of The Krag as a chilling wind blows down the valley formed by the eastern slope of Sentoph Mountain and the western slope of The Krag.  Below, a steeply sloped wall leads to the top of a rockslide at the southern end of the Twin Canyons, while to the southeast a trail climbs towards Krag's Peak which towers several thousand feet away.  Across the canyon Sentoph's peak reaches nearly as high into the night sky.",
    "Bright sunlight counters the cold mountain air blowing through the valley formed by the eastern slope of Sentoph Mountain and the western slope of The Krag.  Below, a steeply sloped wall leads to the top of a rockslide at the southern end of the Twin Canyons, while to the southeast a trail climbs towards Krag's Peak which towers several thousand feet away.  Across the canyon, Sentoph's peak reaches nearly as high into the sky."
