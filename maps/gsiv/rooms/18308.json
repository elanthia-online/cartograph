    "The abundance of vegetation characteristic of the untamed jungle suddenly gives way to a towering kapok tree, the giant of the forest dominating the shadows of night with its majestic presence.  Giving the massive being a wide berth, the thick carpeting of grass and fallen leaves provides a moisture-soaked home for the flourishing mushrooms and fungi occupying the clearing. Moonlight illuminates the mist infiltrating the area, glistening off of the damp, muddy soil as the smell of decay prevails."
