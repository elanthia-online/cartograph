    "[Sunken Shipwreck Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Painted onto the smooth, worn surface of the driftwood table is the image of a sailing ship resting on the bottom of the sea.  Pale blues and greens surround the once proud vessel and coral and kelp grow around it.  The ship's mast rises out of the table, and a small nautical flag hangs from it. The high-backed chairs are padded with plush blue cushions.  A single small fish is crudely engraved into the otherwise perfect surface of the table."
