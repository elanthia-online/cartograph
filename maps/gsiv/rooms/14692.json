    "An antique mahogany bar gleams softly in the light cast by hurricane lamps placed at either end.  Near the large window to the west, a long, narrow table displays a wide variety of treats favored by the more elite citizens of the lands.  On the eastern wall, your attention is drawn to a handsome long mahogany shelf bearing a collection of colored crystal goblets.  In the shadow of its forerunner, a short mahogany shelf holds a single cut glass goblet."
