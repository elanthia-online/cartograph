    "Tall and graceful, this triple-step waterfall cascades from tier to tier, moving down the cliff wall in gentle leaps.  Rock shelves extend out, catching the thin streaming spray in a shallow pool that spills over the downsloping side.  Twice more the falls are snagged, until it washes down the remaining canyon wall, to constantly renew the clear basin."
