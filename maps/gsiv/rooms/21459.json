    "A pair of elaborate bronze braziers flank the entry of the tent, illuminating the interior with a soft glow.  Threads of smoke drift upward from censers placed along the floor.  The right side of the tent is embroidered in numerous Liabo symbols leading towards a polished white marble altar, while the left side is adorned with Lornon symbols around a polished black marble altar."
