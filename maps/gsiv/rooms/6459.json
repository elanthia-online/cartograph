    "Towering pines ring the edge of this small island, their fragrance wafting about you on each wisp of a breeze.  Wildflowers, their colors washed away by the greying moonlight, carpet the ground, and mingle with honeysuckle to creep up the stone walls of a small shrine that stands in the center of the circle of trees.  From somewhere nearby, an owl calls out its strange song, and is answered by another deeper in the forest.",
    "Towering pines ring the edge of this small island, their fragrance wafting about you on each wisp of a breeze.  Wildflowers in vibrant hues of pink, yellow, red, and blue carpet the ground, and mingle with honeysuckle to creep up the stone walls of a small shrine that stands in the center of the circle of trees.  From somewhere nearby, a loon calls out its strange song, and is answered by the chirping of other small birds of the forest."
