    "A moonlit pond stretches away to the west, bordered by shadowy banks on the opposite shore.  Tall reeds and cattails crowd the water's edge, interspersed with stretches of beach where frogs sing loudly to the night.  The lane curves toward the pond, giving access to a wharf extending out over the water on round pilings.",
