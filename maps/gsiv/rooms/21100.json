  "description": [
    "Cracked cobblestones jut out of the ground at odd angles where a stream has eroded part of the courtyard on its meandering path to a pond at the center.  Ruined walls of sandstone ring the eastern and northern walls, broken only by a section of intact building where a window and an alcove have been refurbished.  Swaying in the gentle breeze is a rope bridge leading over the jungle paths to a cliff."
