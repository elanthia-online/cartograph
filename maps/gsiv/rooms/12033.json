    "The irregular shadows of night darkened ruins spread out to the southeast of the pyramid.  Wide stone steps lead down to the streets below.  Another set of steps leads further up the sides of this pyramid.",

Wide stone steps lead down to the streets below.  Another set of steps lead up to the second story of the pyramid."
