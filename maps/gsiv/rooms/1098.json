  "description": [
    "The trek continues around the edge of the plateau with no sign of ending anytime soon.  The sky holds a black expanse filled with stars, but it is difficult to spend time examining them and not walk off the plateau's edge.  The Dead Plateau is uninteresting, displaying its flat, windswept surface with myriad cracks and crevices, and the hills below are a uniform shade of dull grey.  If one did not die here from the cold and lack of water, it is conceivable that one could die of boredom.",

The Dead Plateau is equally uninteresting, displaying its flat, windswept surface with myriad cracks and crevices, and the hills below are a uniform shade of dull yellow brown.  If one did not die here from the cold and lack of water, it is conceivable that one could die of boredom."
