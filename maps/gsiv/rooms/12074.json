  "description": [
    "A beaten animal track parallels the edge of a huge granite boulder, moving north, then circling around to the west.  To the south spreads a wide meadow.  The grassy expanse is unmarred by evidence of the former inhabitants of the city, except for an occasional, unnaturally straight mound of dirt running like a giant mole tunnel across the surface of the ground."
