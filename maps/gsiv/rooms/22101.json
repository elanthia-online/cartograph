  "description": [
    "The walls and ceiling of the large auditorium are crafted of thin beams of honey-colored oak, all assembled in an elegant design calculated to enhance the room's acoustics.  Rows of benches march down the floor's gentle descent, toward a stage at the far end of the hall.  Indigo blue runners muffle footsteps, matching dark blue velvet curtains framing the stage.  A row of lanterns sits across the stage's lip, like gargoyles guarding a tower's heights."
