    "A ruddy glow filters down from high above, casting the room in a bright crimson light.  To the north stands a large altar of thick blue glaes, its face set with a large stylized sun of pure gold.  Behind the altar is a statue of a man whose etched features bespeak of absolute confidence, and his hair is crafted of the same gleaming metal as the sun.  A radiating sunburst pattern is set into the floor, the wavily-rendered flames tinted a fiery golden scarlet by the glow above."
