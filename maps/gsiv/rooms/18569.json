  "description": [
    "A burst of brilliant foliage draws attention to this small stand of artichoke plants that seem to be the jewels of the otherwise bland field of green that they reside in.  Large purple flowers burst out in a bright purple floral display couched in the silvery green foliage of the artichoke plants.  This particular area of the field has obviously been cultivated for display rather than harvesting for food."
