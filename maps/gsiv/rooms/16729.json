    "Turbulence heaves the water into a nightmarish beast, smashing against the rough rock walls, before rolling over itself in a roaring fury.  It is extremely difficult to maintain balance and equilibrium in the maelstrom, and the strong current threatens to suck you away to a watery demise.  The only refuge lies on the floor of the ravine, either to the the north side or the south side of the river."
