    "From here, the greying base of the northeastern river guardtower dominates the landscape.  The massive structure overshadows the plain house by the side of the path, as it looks out, brooding and purposeful, over the town's river gates and the bay to the north.  A handpainted sign hangs in front of the smaller dwelling."
