    "A set of enormous planed oak doors lead into the hull area, the top half of each door set with mullioned panes of glass etched with a stylized wave and anchor pattern.  A giant, cast iron replica of the Wavedancer is overturned in front of the doors, blocking passage.  Barely visible through the murky waters above, the crow's nest is still perched at the top of the submersed main mast."
