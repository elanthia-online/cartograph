    "This intersection teems with movement, though the atmosphere is quiet--even contemplative.  The bulk of the traffic consists of serious-looking elves in clerical robes who move in a business-like manner between the various professional establishments in the neighborhood and the Hall of Patrons, visible just a short distance to the north.",
    "A few elves in clerical robes wander through the intersection, their weary looks suggesting that they are heading home after a long day's service to their patron.  A few younger elves congregate in small groups, making dinner plans or discussing some finer point of theology.  A light scent of incense wafts down the wey from the Hall of Patrons, visible just a short distance to the north.",
    "Stone slabs and bronze sculptures wall in the wey, their faces the memorials to elven families lost to time.  Nearly all have at least one crest and most are marked as well with the seal of Ta'Illistim.  One white marble obelisk is set apart, piercing the sky from atop a raised pedestal of purple porphyry."
