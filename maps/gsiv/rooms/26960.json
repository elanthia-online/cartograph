  "description": [
    "Smooth gold-veined tiles line the narrow lane, their edges inlaid with red, blue, green, black, and white circles that overlap in labyrinthine designs.  Verdant cypress trees sway in a breeze that hints at the scent of the sea, heady roses, and delectable cuisines, while the star-spangled night sky enhances the soft glow of the distant travertine spire."
