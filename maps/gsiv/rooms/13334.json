    "The low walled lane travels around the perimeter of a large ornamental pond, its border a scalloped edging of smooth stone.  Lily pads dot the calm surface of the water and dragonflies dart back and forth on their translucent wings.  Peacocks stroll on a lawn in the distance, their progress punctuated by displays of plumage.",
    "The low walled lane travels around the perimeter of a large ornamental pond, its border a scalloped edging of smooth stone.  Lily pads dot the calm surface of the water, their blooms closed against the moonlight.  Frogs send their hoarse serenades into the night in a raucous din."
