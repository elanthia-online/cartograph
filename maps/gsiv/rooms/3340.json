    "Wild roses scrabble for a purchase on a tall iron fence topped by an imposing array of spikes.  An immense padlock guards the gate entering the long-forgotten garden, the owner long since vanished in circumstances that at best could be considered suspect.  A simple gravel path leads back from the fenceline into the tangled overgrown bushes."
