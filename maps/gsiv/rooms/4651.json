  "description": [
    "Cresting the top of the hill provides an ideal vantage point of the snow-capped mountains that tower in the distance and the town common spreading out below.  The wan glow of a moon peeks out from between two of the largest mountains, their perpetual misty clouds breaking apart to allow a thick beam of light.  Illuminated by the faint moonlight is a small clearing surrounded on three sides by thick ancient forest growth and a steep mountain slope in the remaining direction.",
    "Cresting the top of the hill provides an ideal vantage point of the snow-capped mountains that tower in the distance and the town common spreading out below.  The glowing ball of the sun peeks out from the perpetual mists that surround two of the largest mountaintops.  Off to the side, a small clearing is host to some ancient ruins and abandoned buildings."
