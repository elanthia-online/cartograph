    "The smell of oiled leather and dust lingers in the air.  Three raised wooden beams cross the stone floor in parallel.  Each beam, intended for kneeling upon in contemplation, is topped with an assortment of small, razor sharp pieces of glass and metal.  Numerous whips and crops hang from a set of hooks on the eastern wall and a single torch provides light from its sconce next to the door."
