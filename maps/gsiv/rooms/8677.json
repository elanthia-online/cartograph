    "Heavy velvet curtains are partially drawn in this room, allowing some light to filter through the sheers behind them.  Near the window is a small sitting area containing a sofa, a chair, and a writing desk.  Just inside the carved maoral door, a feather bed stands next to a double-doored wardrobe closet."
