    "Cramped and crowded, the small room appears to be a warehouse with brick walls and a knotty oak floor.  Stacks of boxes and containers are piled to the ceiling in many places and create a labyrinthine maze of packed goods.  Incredibly faint light leaks out from behind one particular short stack of wooden crates, while light from the alley also filters in through the open doorway."
