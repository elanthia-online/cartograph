    "Water rushes swiftly over the smooth stones at the bottom of the water, torchlight from the courtyard casting golden tracks across the surface.  Trout sway their fins back and forth as they maintain their positions under the shadow of a nearby tree.  The water feels cold and refreshing and is loud enough to drown out nearby sounds.  A turtle considers you from head to toe from the top of an especially large stone sticking out of the middle of the stream.",
