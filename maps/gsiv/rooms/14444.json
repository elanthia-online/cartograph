  "description": [
    "Tiers of bronzed lobster lanterns banish all the shadows from the tiny gift shop.  A particularly brightly lit corner houses crustacean-themed artwork in the form of a giant statue and mosaic.  Numerous tacky souvenirs lay sprawled out upon a rickety counter, adjacent to a pair of warped tables and a dusty stack of crates."
