    "Footsteps echo noisily off the red marble floor, the sound amplified by the immense glass-and-oak ceiling that arches high overhead.  Carved walnut chairs and polished walnut tables scattered about the lobby do little to reduce the lobby's cavernous impression.  A golden pine, twenty feet high, thrives in a circular brass planter in the lobby's center, and hundreds of framed portraits, apparently of famous Ta'Vaalor citizens, occupy the varnished walnut walls.",
