    "Hardwood planks extend from the salle into the office, only to snake underneath the rugs scattered on the floor.  Resting in a corner is a small wooden desk with an upholstered chair sitting behind it.  A large, white vultite shield hangs from the wall behind the desk.  Tall bookshelves, overflowing with records and books, stand against the eastern wall."
