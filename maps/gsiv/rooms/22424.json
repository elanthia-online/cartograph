    "Curving to the east, the narrow room has a packed dirt floor and an arched ceiling that gradually culminates to a point in the east.  A long, low counter stretches across the middle of the space and offers a glimpse of the wares that are on sale, while a plethora of bronze lanterns above offers ample illumination for the space.  Bits of colored glass create prismatic sprays upon the walls as they gently rotate upon the wire that they are hung from."
