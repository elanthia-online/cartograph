    "Golden votive candles line both edges of the path at regular intervals.  Vines of wisteria and honeysuckle sprout from small soil beds behind the candles, weaving around each other and framing the path both north and south.  Several sheer gossamer panels stretch overhead on tall iron poles from the rampart to the keep, creating a shifting canopy and holding the fragrance of the vines close to the ground."
