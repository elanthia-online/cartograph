    "The head of the bluff is rampant with flowers, a heady mixture of fragrant rhododendron blossoms, snow-white trillium, purple violets, and the delicate ruby bells of bleeding hearts trembling on their arched fronds.  Overhead, the wide boughs of the trees block all but a subtle beam of the moons, creating an otherworldly, ghostly light within the copse.",

Overhead, the wide boughs of the trees shelter the delicate blooms from midday sun and offer an otherworldly, green-tinged light within the copse."
