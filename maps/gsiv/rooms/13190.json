    "A tall black iron and white imflass fence encircles the grounds of Fasthr's Lance to the north.  Winding through a spade-topped stygian steel gate, a broad flagstone road leads from the esplanade toward the stone bulk of the tower.  Whitewashed and tall, the tower rises from a courtyard atop a green hillock."
