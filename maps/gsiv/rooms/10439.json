    "Pale haon walls set with brightly-trimmed windows make for a light and airy waiting room.  Neatly arranged next to one of the large openings is a sitting area with a view of the street.  Fresh gardenias gently float in a round glaes bowl sitting on a low counter, adding their sweet fragrance to the room.  Towards the back sits a desk with two wire baskets that overflow with paperwork, the only contrast to the otherwise tidy office."
