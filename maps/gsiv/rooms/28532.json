    "Kidney-shaped tidal pools pockmark the black sands that stretch to the north, while boulders and rocky formations create a barrier that protects the tranquil waters from the waves beyond.  Every now and again, moonlight breaks through the heavy mist that clings to the beach and dances upon the white sands at the bottom of the tiny pools.  A rack of racks and nets is built against a set of rough oak steps that leads to a canopy in the east."
