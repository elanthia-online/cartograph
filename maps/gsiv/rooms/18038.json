    "Just like the trees on the west side of the neighborhood, a large earth, ice, and snow berm provides a windbreak against the fierce storms that roll across the frontier.  In some places on the outer slope, icicles have grown upwards due to the constant wind, giving the hill a set of frosty teeth."
