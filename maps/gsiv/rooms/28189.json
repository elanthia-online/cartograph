    "Polished monir floors are stained a light, golden hue to complement the painted dark blue walls of the wagon's entranceway.  To one side of the door, a wooden rack is crowded with outerwear, and on the other, a multitude of footwear is arranged beneath a padded bench.  An elaborately rendered map of the Empire is framed in gilt and hung above the bench."
