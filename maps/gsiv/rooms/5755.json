    "The tunnel opens out into a large, open, hemispherical space.  Extending from the wall is a building facade with the words \"Mraent Granite Quarry\" carved above a rounded archway.  A heavy iron door, smashed by some tremendous blow, hangs precariously from its hinges, no longer securing the hallway that leads deep into the darkness beyond."
