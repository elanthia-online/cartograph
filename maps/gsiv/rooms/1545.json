    "Low-built cottages shingled to the ground line the west side of the road, while a tall building with expansive glaes windows stands opposite them.  Dozens of oak-staved tuns are stacked along the front of the building, and polished metal surfaces distorted by the bevelled panes can be glimpsed through the windows.  For such a large building, there seems to be little activity around it."
