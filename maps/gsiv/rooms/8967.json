    "Ma's Court is scarcely more than an alley, yet the quaint charm of the buildings along it give it a decided appeal.  The lane runs near to the Tuckered Inn, and that edifice's imposing facade can be glimpsed over the rooftops of the houses bordering the court.  From somewhere close by, the melody of a mandolin can be heard, its double strings singing a harmonic air."
