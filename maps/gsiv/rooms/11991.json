    "A grey tower thrusts itself up from the pinnacle of the hill like a finger pointing toward the stars.  Each block of granite making up the wall of the tower is carved with varying sizes of eight-pointed stars. Etched into the keystone of the arched entrance leading into the tower is the rounded orb of a full moon.  A flight of broken stone steps leads back down the side of the hill.",

Each block of granite making up the wall of the tower is carved with varying sizes of eight-pointed stars. Etched into the keystone of the arched entrance leading into the tower is a multi-rayed representation of the sky.  A flight of broken stone steps leads back down the side of the hill."
