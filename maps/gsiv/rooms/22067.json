    "Rays of sunlight shine through the tall window, giving the wood trim a lustrous golden shine.  A wide writing desk is placed to once side, and a variety of instruments displayed on a rack leans against the wall.  Carved from dark mahogany, a gold-inlaid music stand is placed in the center of a bright carpet, while several sheafs of sheet music are haphazardly piled all about."
