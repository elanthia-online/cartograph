    "Loud thuds and dull explosions fill the air as meteorites explode across the dome above, each impact creating a lightning-like flash of silvery light that cast the area in startling, grey relief for brief moments of time before darkness floods back in.  Ivory walls rise high upon the enormous basin, their faces pitted and cracked where cosmic rocks have laid carnage to their natural beauty.  Pulsating at a steady, heartbeat-like pace, a nearby glass-lined ring offers a modicum of illumination to the golden tiles."
