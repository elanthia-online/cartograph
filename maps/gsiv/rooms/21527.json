    "Patched walls of rugged canvas are secured by solid oak corner posts.  Intricate cast iron lanterns hang from each post, casting a warm glow over the large space.  A massive center post supports the gathered fabric of the ceiling.  Several nails protrude from the central support, holding various goods for sale.  A curtain is hung across the back of the tent, partitioning off some work space."
