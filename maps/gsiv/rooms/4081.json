    "One of the legs of a rickety chair is shorter than the others are; to help compensate for its imperfection the leg rests on a square piece of wood.  Occupying the chair, an abandoned stuffed steel golem with pieces of jet for eyes sits limply.  The warped oak floor is covered with a light dusting of straw.  Along the back wall, a pile of cushions takes up space in front of a gaping hole."
