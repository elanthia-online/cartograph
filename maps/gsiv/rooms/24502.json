    "Rectangular panels of polished witchwood, set with several veil iron sconces, enclose three sides of the room, while the fourth is made entirely of glass.  An enormous window, with its wide bench, provides an unobstructed view of the majestic greens of Melgorehn's Reach and the multichromatic Lake Eonak.  Dark walnut flooring is softened by a thick silk rug, accompanied by several dark leather armchairs.  In a far corner, a set of straight ko'nag stairs lead downward, and through an open doorway a few bar stools against a countertop are visible."
