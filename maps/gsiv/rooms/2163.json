    "The trail meanders between pools of lava and a precipice that falls away to the northwest.  Around the magma pits, ridges of cooled lava create striated parallel rings.  An excretion of still-cooling molten rock has collected in spots within the ridges, like smoking discharge around the eyes of some great lizard."
