    "A trio-bladed mounted vellum fan hangs on one of the rough white stucco walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A miniature Solhaven Bay model sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is a brass treasure chest on one side of the shop and a glass-covered box case on the other."
