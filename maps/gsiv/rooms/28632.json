    "A gentle, rain-scented breeze pouring in from the huge bay window ruffles your hair.  The leaves of the herbs growing in pots near various other windows in the room wave in the wind, nourished by the fresh air and the warmth from the still-glowing embers in the stone hearth.  Over the fireplace you notice a fine portrait of a dark elven empath and half-elven cleric kneeling over a slain body in a forest. In the center of the room is a huge, neatly made bed full of soft pillows."
