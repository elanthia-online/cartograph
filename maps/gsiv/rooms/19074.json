    "Perched here on the jib-boom just behind the bowsprit cap, one has a close-hand view of the beautifully crafted figurehead.  Gentle eddies of sea water caress the ship's bow, but beyond the harbor mouth, whitecaps stretch away to the horizon.  Where open sea begins, flying fish cavort, leaping from the crests of the waves."
