    "Laid out in millions of tiny glaes tesserae, the domed ceiling is tiled in silver and green, its pattern a canopy of forest boughs.  The mosaic flows down the walls as tree trunks, before stopping halfway to meet a register of wooden panels.  A carpet of woven silk is laid out, creating a soft, natural-looking floor.  Several open archways fan out to other parts of the chancery.  Paneled with wood, a large door stands across the room from a tiny one of modwir."
