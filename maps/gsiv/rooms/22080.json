  "description": [
    "Gazing out from the balcony you can see the southwest corner of the Town Square.  The bustle and clamor of the town seems blessedly far away.  A rose-covered trellis climbs up to the balcony from the grounds below.  The subtle smell of roses mixes pleasantly with the rich smell of ale from the pub."
