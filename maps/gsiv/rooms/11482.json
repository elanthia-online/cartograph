  "description": [
    "A deep layer of muck covers the curve of the starboard bulkhead underfoot.  Overhead, the arc of the port bulkhead is buckled.  A massive gash in the wall now formed by the hull is surrounded by huge, jagged splinters.  A smashed hatchway that once would have led to the deck now acts as a window, blocked by the coral reef.  The broken staves of barrels, turned almost blonde by the saltwater, float overhead against the port bulkhead."
