    "Crushed leaves and broken grasses mark the passage of beasts, demarcating the line between the interior of the rainforest and the rest of the island.  Banyan, rosewood, and teak tower into the sky, hung with liana vines suspended downward from the limbs above.  Closer to the earth, ferns cluster.  The smell is damp and musty, ripe with the odor of decaying vegetation, a testament to the constant regeneration of the deep forest."
