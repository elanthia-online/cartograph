    "On one side of the room a young couple speak earnestly with a clerk while their two children run in and around the long row of shipping crates.  The pale wood crates are marked with exotic runes and common lettering alike.  Nearby, another clerk whistles tunefully while he studies a long list of figures.  The mixed scent of wood dust and salt air wafts on the warm breeze that rolls in through the large open door."
