  "description": [
    "Three slender trees grow up beside the artichoke field, their limbs graced with only a handful of pale green leaves.  Their willowy builds bend slightly with passing breezes, unlike the artichoke stalks, which seem to have hardened themselves against the wind, in the neighboring field.  Underfoot, the soil from the field, which is a rich, brown color, splatters across the dusty trail that edges several like fields."
