    "These dim chambers serve as the private offices of the temple's monks.  Dark gray robes hang limply from tarnished brass hooks fixed to the wall.  A small urn burns some relaxing incense in the far corner.  The only luxuries are a hard wooden bench running the distance of the far wall, and a simple wooden table.  Near the back of the chamber sits a small wooden staircase.",
    "Lurking beyond a brass crested arch, the dim chamber serves as a sanctum for the monks of the temple.  Violet-hemmed grey robes hang limply from a series of tarnished brass hooks affixed to the western wall.  Within a small crystal urn in the far corner, some grey-green wormwood incense incense burns and fills the air with its cloying scent.  Near the back of the chamber sits a small wooden staircase."
