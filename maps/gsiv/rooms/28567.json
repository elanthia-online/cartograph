  "description": [
    "Standing on either side of a curved arch passageway that leads to another room of this modest abode are a dark stained wood dresser and tall brown wardrobe.  A large multi-colored quilt covers a bed residing near a red-framed window on the far wall, while two smaller bunk beds dressed with green knit blankets occupy the space on the other side of the room.  In the far corner, a white porcelain bathtub joins a small driftwood table bearing a matching pitcher and wash basin."
