    "The canyon twists and narrows, ascending to the northeast and descending to the west.  Nothing grows in the canyon, neither on the ice nor on the sheer mountainsides.  Perhaps the snow's constant downward slide scrapes the rocks clean of any moss or vegetation that might attempt to take hold there.  The moon reflects brightly off the snow on the southeastern wall, eliminating shadows and bathing the area in a solid, eerie glare.",
