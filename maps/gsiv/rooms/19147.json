    "Twining vines creep along the walls, creating a pattern of overlapping verdant leaves dotted by the occasional splash of color, courtesy of tiny yellow and crimson flowers blooming even when indoors.  A bare wall at the back of the room is elaborately painted with shadowy animal silhouettes that are depicted in spirited poses among lush flora."
