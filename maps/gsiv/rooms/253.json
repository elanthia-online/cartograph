    "Here Riverwind Street leads to the West Crossing, where traffic over the bridge moves off in all directions.  Carts, wagons, pedestrians, and wayfarers of every stripe pass by the busy intersection, no matter how late the night.  A flagstone path leads away from the road, passing out of view through a lattice arch covered with dark ivy.",
    "Here Riverwind Street leads to the West Crossing, and bridge traffic in all directions chokes the road.  Carts, wagons, pedestrians, flocks of poultry and herds of livestock, and wayfarers of every stripe compete for territory.  A flagstone path leads away from the congestion, passing out of view through a lattice arch covered with dark ivy."
