  "description": [
    "Stretching across the rocky shoals and interrupting a cliff-hugging oak railing, a sturdy oak catwalk links the land to a sprawling network of piers where boats lay at anchor.  To the north, a market of brightly colored tents sprawls across a blue and black cobblestone courtyard against the backdrop of towering cliffs.  Built in the middle of the road, a black shop has an incredibly wordy sign posted on its front door."
