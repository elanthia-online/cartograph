  "description": [
    "Wedged between the two adjoining buildings, the cramped shop measures only a few spans wide, the claustrophobic aura enhanced by the thick beams supporting the ceiling.  In contrast to the drabness, light trickling in from the window set in the narrow door reveals an abrupt end to the packed dirt from outside and glints off various metallic wares displayed along the plastered walls.  A squat little stove, crackling with burning wood, serves to keep the few refreshments on top piping hot and the shop's patrons warm."
