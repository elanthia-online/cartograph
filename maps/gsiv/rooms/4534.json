    "Tapering slightly from the central post, the ceiling in this section of the tent is only slightly lower from the main entry chamber.  Durable cords of hemp draw the walls outward at an angle to create a free flowing space that is riddled with crates, boxes, and footlockers.  Unpacked wares mix with sealed ones along the back of the tent, where a young dwarf sporting a new beard growth works furiously at polishing a slender runestaff."
