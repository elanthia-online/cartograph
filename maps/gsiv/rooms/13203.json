    "Three tents share a firepit here.  Large enough to bunk ten or twelve people each, the tents appear to have seen better days.  The westernmost tent has been patched so many times that the original fabric is no longer discernible.  The northern tent was once gaily striped, but now is so faded that it is striped in dull grey.  The easternmost tent is a sun-bleached, drab green.  Standing near the firepit is a tall pole with a shield strapped to the top of it."
