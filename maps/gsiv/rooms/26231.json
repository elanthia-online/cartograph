    "[Inside Weffinait's Wagon]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The inside of this large wagon is even more spacious than it appears from the outside.  A long wooden counter stretches the length of the interior, with packed shelves behind it, reaching from floor to polished wood ceiling.  Boxes upon boxes of wares are stacked neatly in the corners, each with its contents labeled by a clear hand.  A set of stairs leads back outside."
