  "description": [
    "Windows decorated with colorful stained glaes look out over the countryside.  Jutting out slightly from the rest of the building, this alcove provides a pleasant place to sit and read, or simply daydream.  Fluffy pillows covered in soft velvet line the padded seat, and a small wooden ledge thoughtfully offers a spot to place a drink or light snack."
