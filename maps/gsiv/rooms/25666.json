  "description": [
    "The Drumsong table has been carved to resemble a large kettledrum, its head fitted with maple in place of skin.  Small drums of various types are depicted in a ring around the edge, all fashioned of tiny pieces of inlaid wood.  A lantern occupies the table's center, casting a cheerful glow through its ruby-stained glass sides."
