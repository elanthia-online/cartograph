    "[The Alliance Jail Cell]"

  "description": [
    "A heavy mithril hatch secures the jail cells from the rest of the outpost.  The only source of light is a small griffin-shaped lantern sitting on top of a desk.  On the rear wall a large notice board is covered with warrants and wanted posters.  The port side is lined with two sturdy iron holding cells.  A collection set of chains and shackles are on display at the rear of the room, while almost hidden away in the far corner, three skeletons still dangle from their restraints."
