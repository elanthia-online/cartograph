    "The spines of countless dozens of books greet the visitor to a rectangular space north of the hallway.  A large highback chair is situated next to a small fireplace set with three equally small logs, ready to provide heat and illumination.  A pair of dust-covered reading glasses sit on a table adjacent to the chair, while behind the chair rests a scroll rack filled almost to capacity with rolled up pieces of vellum and paper."
