    "A medley of enticing aromas dance and mingle, filling the air with a fragrance that teases the palate.  Pots of soup burble on the stove, freshly baked breads await tasting on a wobbly sideboard, and pies cool upon the sill of an open window.  A trail of scraps and tiny pawprints leads into a curtained pantry."
