    "The silence on the ledge combined with the heavy mist isolates the area.  The only features are a light grey wall of fog to the west and the solid dark grey of the mountain to the east.  A nearly imperceptible breeze floats past occasionally, adding to the eerie atmosphere.  The ledge leads off to the northwest, and the cliff below looks scalable."
