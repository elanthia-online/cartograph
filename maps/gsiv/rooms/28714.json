    "Across from a curtained opening, a cushioned bench rests in front of a long counter, its top a masterpiece of marquetry using glowbark, lor, and dark heartwood to depict a pair of elf owls hidden amidst a chaos of leaves.  A silvered glass mirror in one corner reflects a trio of graduated crimson orbs overhead which softly illuminate the polished wood floors."
