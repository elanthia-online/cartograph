    "A few patrons walk the cobblestones of the bazaar at night, their faces illuminated by glaesine-paned lanterns set before a row of storefronts.  Several of the shops have closed for the evening, thick curtains concealing the merchandise within.",
    "In an attempt to draw customers, a quartet of musicians have set up in front of a row of storefronts.  Their effervescent music draws a small crowd and enthusiastic applause after every piece.  Several merchants watch appreciately outside the doorways of their cozy shops."
