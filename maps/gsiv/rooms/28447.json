  "description": [
    "This corner of the workshop is less cluttered than the rest, and there are intricate sigils etched into the floor in a circular pattern.  The chandelier overhead contains only a single candle, but its light is reflected towards the floor by a variety of large mirrors mounted to the edge of the chandelier, bathing the area in intense light.  Scorch marks can be seen marring the walls in various places, and there is what appears to be the imprint of a taloned claw on the ceiling."
