    "Rough wooden walls with knotty holes make up this small cramped wagon.  The inside is devoid of decoration, save a tiny window with crystal-beaded curtains.  A rusty-hinged travel trunk sits on the floor, near a beat-up wooden table that is using a stack of books to make up for the missing leg."
