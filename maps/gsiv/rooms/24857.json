    "A pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the polished oak walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  Some puffed raw silk pillows sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a flexible willow woven basket on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
