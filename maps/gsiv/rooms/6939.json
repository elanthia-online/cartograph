    "Lancets, needles, razors, and scalpels have been laid out in tidy arrays atop a narrow chest of drawers.  A solid oak chair fitted with many leather straps is pushed up against the flimsy wooden screen.  The sole nod to cleanliness appears to be a bowl of wine used to soak the instruments between uses."
