    "Small rocks skip down the wall, making a clattering noise for several moments before finding a place to rest.  The remaining wall appears highly unstable and the source for the majority of rubble that comprises the rockslide.  Not far above, the rim of the canyon is visible against the silvery night sky.  Sloping steeply and containing many loose and jagged rocks, the wall beyond this point appears to be an impossible climb.",
