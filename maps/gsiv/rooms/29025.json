    "Protruding from the face of the southern cliff, moss and bracken cling to fractured clasts of a conglomerate of deep red stone.  The bedding plane juts into the roadway at an angle that forces traffic around it, while also preventing the sturdy wooden railing from continuing westward.  Copper beech trees stretch their long limbs to the sky, casting irregular shadows throughout the area."
