  "description": [
    "Murky water stretches into the haze in all directions.  To the south the island curves away in a long rocky spit.  To the north a lower hill rests beyond a row of natural stepping stones.  Moss covers the island from one end to the other.  The top of the hill is split open revealing a mossy cave below."
