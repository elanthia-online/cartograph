    "The broad sweep of the golden oak floor is interrupted by a serene golden wyvern fountain.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, an old elven war banner hangs on one of the textured blue silk walls.  A floral-etched ceramic case and an intricately carved ebonwood stand are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
