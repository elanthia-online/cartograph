    "This richly painted room is a stark departure from the construction and decor of the entry.  Each of the walls is painted a rich purple color with bright golden accents at both floor and ceiling level.  In the center of the room is a wide desk of gleaming mahogany, and underfoot, the oak floor has been polished to a high sheen.  Brass sconces line the walls, each one highly polished, allowing them to gleam from nearly every angle."
