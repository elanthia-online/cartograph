    "The silvery moonlight gives this tidy little side yard garden plot a mystical glow.  Vines, laden with cucumbers in various stages of growth, twine on a series of low wooden trellises.  A gardener's bench occupies one corner of the plot.  The walls of the surrounding shops block the noise, making the small garden an oasis of quietude.",

A gardener's bench occupies one corner of the plot.  The walls of the surrounding shops block the noise, making the small garden an oasis of quietude."
