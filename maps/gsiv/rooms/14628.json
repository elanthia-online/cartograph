  "description": [
    "Somewhat dimmer than the main tea room, the recessed alcove provides a quiet place for intimate conversation.  A colorful floral painting hangs on the wall in a plain wood frame.  The soft murmurings of the popular tea room and bakery are just barely audible in here.  Plush cushions look inviting and the fresh picked wildflowers in a vase add color as well as charm to this out of the way rendezvous."
