    "The windmill towers over the city walls at the southwestern corner of town, and the gentle creaking of the mechanism competes with the whistling of the wind through the great western forest to fill the air with a constant din.  Off to the east stand the arms and armory shops, from which a great smoke and noise rises night and day."
