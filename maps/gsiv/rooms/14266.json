    "Sunlight peeks under the single door to provide scant illumination for the empty and windowless room, while above the high ceiling is lost in darkness.  Green felt-covered tables house ash-filled shells, which adds to the scent of stale tobacco smoke and spilt beer.  A fresh smattering of rushes covers the floor around a highly polished modwir bar and several sturdy oak bar stools.",
    "Swirls of tobacco smoke eddy about the high ceiling of this windowless room.  A highly polished modwir bar surrounded by several sturdy oak bar stools, does brisk business along one wall of the room.  Inconspicuous guards are perched at either end, their eyes inspecting the crowds with an unrevealing air."
