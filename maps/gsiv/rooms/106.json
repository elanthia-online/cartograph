    "Far above and to the north you see an unusual mountain peak silhouetted against the sky.  It is divided into four nearly equal prongs, each one perilously steep and doused in snow.  This ridge trail curves around toward it and looks like the only navigable path, at least until you sprout wings and learn to fly."
