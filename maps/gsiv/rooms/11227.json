    "You jump, startled as the silence is broken by the howl of a not so distant wolf.  It's possible that this walkway once led to a sally port or gateway in the castle walls.  But if so, it is lost under the tons of rubble left when those walls were destroyed.  Now, the walkway disappears under a long mossy mound of huge stones."
