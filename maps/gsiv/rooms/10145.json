    "Small islands of waving cord grass surrounded by black marsh water dot the landscape, most of them overhung with dark clouds of gnats and mosquitoes shimmering in the light.  Orange-gold mushrooms shaped like miniature goblets are interspersed throughout the cord grass, while a dark brown saddle-shaped fungus sprawls across tree branches.  Rising from one of the larger islands, a moss-covered ivory pillar glistens in the sparse rays of the sun.",
