    "Wall to wall shelves house a variety of crates and casks, their sides labeled with the various vintages held within.  Brightly glowing frosted orbs are suspended from wrought iron posts that connect to the ceiling, their light strong enough to read by, while a narrow passage lined with a pale blue runner connects this room to the other portions of the shop."
