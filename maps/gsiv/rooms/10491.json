    "A snarling war griffin painting hangs on one of the painted emerald green walls, and a stained mahogany ceiling rises overhead.  A hanging suit of brigandine armor sits in one corner of a dark oak parquet floor.  There is a long mahogany rack on one side of the shop and a wide faenor-trimmed table on the other."
