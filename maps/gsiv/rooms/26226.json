    "The ground floor of the store is visible through precariously wide gaps in the planks of the floor.  The strong scent of freshly cut lumber emanating from a thin layer of chunks and grains of sawdust covering the platform pervades the room.  Thick wooden pegs protrude from a sloping beam, and a set of uneven stairs heads down to the first floor."
