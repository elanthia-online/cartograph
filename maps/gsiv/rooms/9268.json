  "description": [
    "Footfalls, voices and lanternlight reflect off the polished brass and steel panels of the gemshop's wainscoting, making it a bright and noisy room.  Behind the low, steel-clad counter, Tolruk Stonebiter rests atop a three-legged stool -- jeweller's loupe, black velvet pad and pan balance ready to appraise the next gem or piece of jewelry."
