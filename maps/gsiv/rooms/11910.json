    "The sound of burbling water echoes in darkness, whispery faint, muffled by the surrounding trees.  Deep shadows hug the trunks of the closest trees while night breezes sigh in the darkness beyond.  A glimmer of moonlight filters from the canopy above giving dim life to a few blades of grass scattered across the muddy earth.",
    "The sound of burbling water echoes from the north, whispery faint, muffled by the surrounding trees.  The path is shaded by the trees and a chorus of birds trill from the branches overhead.  Filtered sunlight seeps through the canopy above giving dim life to a few blades of grass scattered across the muddy earth."
