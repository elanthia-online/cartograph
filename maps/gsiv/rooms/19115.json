  "description": [
    "Plain wooden planks form the bulkheads of this room.  Several crates are piled up in the corners with any stray markings scratched or burned off hastily.  Oily smoke from a pair of lanterns provides dim lighting and more than a few shadows.  To the east and west small cramped corridors lined with boxes and bales lead away."
