  "description": [
    "The broad expanse of dirt before you slopes up to the north face of a hewn granite rock incline.  Atop the incline rise the sturdy stone walls of the inner keep.  Ancient masons seem to have planned every bulge and outcropping to impede any attack on the inner ward walls, and yet offer no protection to the attackers from the defenders on the top of the walls."
