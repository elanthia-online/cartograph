    "A painted silk wall panel hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is a series of low oak shelves on one side of the shop and a plain wooden table on the other."
