    "An owl follows you for a while, hooting loudly as it flies from branch to branch, well out of reach.  Perhaps it is hoping you will scare up a rodent for it to devour.  For no apparent reason it turns and disappears back the way it came.  Other night birds call from far back among the trees. Their songs differ in volume, tone and pitch, with some being melodious warblings and others being grating caws.  Every so often one flies across the path or darts out from a bush upon your approach.",
    "A blue jay follows you for a while, raucously shrieking at you as it flies from branch to branch, well out of reach.  Then it quietly turns and disappears back the way it came.  Other birds call from far back among the trees. Their songs differ in volume, tone and pitch, with some being melodious warblings and others being grating caws.  Every so often one flies across the path or darts out from a bush upon your approach."
