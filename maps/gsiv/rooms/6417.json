  "description": [
    "Here amid the thick grass and lush forest of this serene valley, you happen upon a small crystal clear lake.  Two large willow trees bend gracefully in the cool night breeze, their long boughs dipping down to trace delicate patterns on the surface of the moonlit water.  Near the center of the lake, a small, dark island covered with a thicket of pine trees draws your attention.",
