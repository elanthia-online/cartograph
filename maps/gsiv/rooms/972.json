  "description": [
    "A rock-strewn trail descends into the valley, its edges bordered by sparse patches of melting snow which send finger-like rivulets of icy water running down the hillside.  Overhead, a chill wind whistles among unseen crags and caverns, emitting high-pitched squeals and dull moans as reminders of its passage."
