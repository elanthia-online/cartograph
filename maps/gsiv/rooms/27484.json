    "Dominating the space is a large, especially tall painting of an elf, his features bearing hints of Ardenai ancestry, with long, flowing hair formed from silvery eels.  As if mimicking the props in the painting, the black-cushioned chairs situated around the space here are similarly upholstered and appear to be exact replicas of the one the elf sits upon.  Suspended in the center of the area from above by a pale blue swathe of fabric is a gold-framed mirror."
