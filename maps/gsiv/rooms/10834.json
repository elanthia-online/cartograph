    "Something has died just off the road.  It is far enough out in the swamp that moving off the road to investigate would be foolhardy at best, but close enough that the flies and odor are very much apparent.  This, combined with the oppressive humidity, mist, sucking mud and monotonous vegetation suggest that there are probably far more interesting places one could occupy.  The road, as best as can be ascertained, continues to forge northwest and east."
