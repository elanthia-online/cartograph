    "An open stone fireplace stands by the side of the road here, between the cottages in the shade of a small oak tree.  Judging by the rough wooden benches arranged nearby and the lingering smell of roasted meat, it probably serves as a neighborhood barbecue of sorts.  A narrow dirt lane leads north."
