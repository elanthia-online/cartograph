  "description": [
    "Massive columns of limestone formed by the joining of stalagmite and stalactite climb to the ceiling far above.  Sparse patches of moss cling to the side of the columns and shed a faint illumination through the area.  Several large pools and puddles have gathered on the floor and reflect the dim glow, which does nothing to further illuminate the cavern."
