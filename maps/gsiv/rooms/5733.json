    "The scent of drying marshgrass hangs heavy in the air, one of the four tall haycribs that take up this platform looking newly-filled.  Evidently filled in a regular order, the haycribs overflow with marshgrass that ranges from dark green through a pale golden-brown.  A half dozen square-prowed johnboats are moored to the platform's sides."
