    "Making your way along the path between the huts, you are momentarily distracted by the sharp, flapping sound of a hide curtain over the doorway of the hut to the east.  The tattered, patched skin is stained and streaked with years of exposure to the elements.  The rest of the hut reflects a similar degree of neglect."
