    "The office here doubles as a warehouse, as evidenced by the stacks of wooden crates and large boxes that fill nearly two thirds of this room.  Workmen can be seen, handling various crates with care as they move them in and out of the area.  A well maintained sign with rates hangs on the wall near the entrance."
