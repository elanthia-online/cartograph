    "A snarling troll king mask hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and a mosaic tiled ceiling rises overhead.  A bronzed drake sculpture sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is an engraved copper bin on one side of the shop and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on the other."
