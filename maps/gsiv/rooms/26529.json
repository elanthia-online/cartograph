    "Mismatched rows of stalactites drape diagonally along the rock-laden path, the icicle-like formations creating tapered conduits for the droplets of water that mix with the dusty floor below.  A small line of footprints has been imprinted into the muddy puddles, disappearing entirely before the trail ends."
