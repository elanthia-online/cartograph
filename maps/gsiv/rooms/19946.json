    "The walls glisten as water slowly drips down, creating a musty aroma to the shadowy cavern.  Corroded black lanterns provide a soft diffused glow, faintly illuminating a cracked crystal fountain resting between a stack of old crates and a waterlogged bookcase.  A broken chain snakes around a cluster of tarnished bins which are positioned next to a pile of rubble."
