  "description": [
    "An outcropping of huge, jagged boulders extends from the cliff, home to the nest of seemingly hundreds of screeching fenvaoks.  The stones are cluttered with ragged nests of weeds and branches, and the huge birds soar to and fro, bringing food to their young and viciously defending any attempt to approach their haven."
