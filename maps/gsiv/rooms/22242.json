  "description": [
    "Tall wooden stools with criss-crossed backs are arranged in front of a polished cherrywood bar.  Geometric patterns of teak decorate the bar's surface, the names of outlying towns etched elegantly into the wood.  A grey-bearded dwarf tends bar, his oversized belly nearly knocking over the bottles of spirits that line the shelf."
