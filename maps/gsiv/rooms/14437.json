  "description": [
    "Small, dark and lit only by black iron sconces mounted on grey stone walls, the small chapel is austere in design and furnishings.  Two short columns of benches leave room for a rosewood catafalque covered with a simple square of white linen.  Providing a backdrop to this stark scene is a large tapestry rendered in muted hues, illustrating demise at sea."
