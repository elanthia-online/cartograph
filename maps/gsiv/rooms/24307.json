  "description": [
    "A soft melody played on a flute floats through the room, the ranger playing it pausing only to smile at those just entering the lounge.  Large windows set in the west wall give a beautiful view of the forest stretched out below the guild.  A small bar rests in one corner, with small tables clustered before it for those wanting to sit.  Potted plants stand to either side of the double doors leading out."
