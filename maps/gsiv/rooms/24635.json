    "Long, draping walls of pale green silk cascade down from the tent's ceiling, where the material is held up in place by silver pole supports.  Covering the ground are plush layers of dark green rugs that run right up against the walls, and well-placed candles flood the area with light.  A long, pristinely clean glass case displays a selection of masks.  Atop the case's right edge, a silver plaque is perched over a neatly handwritten note."
