    "[The Rift]"

  "description": [
    "Two crippled men, limbs horribly deformed and faces covered in pox, hobble past a grand cathedral.  All about them the street is littered with the dead and dying, moaning and writhing in pain as the epidemic wracks their bodies.  Glittering from the eaves of the church are five gold coins, casting golden motes of light upon the diseased men as if mocking their tortured existence."
