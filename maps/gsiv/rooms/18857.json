    "Warm and relaxing, the room looks quite comfortable -- a small wooden table and two soft chairs sit next to a large bay window that looks out over the lights of town.  One wall is completely taken by a fireplace framed by a marble mantelpiece, and you can see a cauldron simmering over bright orange flames within the hearth.  Piles of neatly organized maps rest neatly on one arm of a long sofa, and a broken harp string is draped carelessly over a wooden cabinet that stands next to it.",
