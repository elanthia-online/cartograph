    "This triangular room is airy and light.  The space smells remarkably crisp and fresh for having no windows.  The tent walls and ceiling are made up entirely of layer upon layer of sheer white fabric.  With no discernable light source, the room still manages to be blindingly bright.  Intricately woven chains of verdant ivy have been used to lovely effect against the diaphanous material.  High-backed, white fabric covered chairs have been placed artfully throughout the room.",
