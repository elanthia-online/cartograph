    "Many branches converge here at this space near the apex of the canopy.  Where several larger branches intersect, a platform with raised edges resides.  Up here the swaying of the trees is pronounced, and the platform moves with every breath of wind as the leaves that create the ceiling rustle gently.  Large gaps in the canopy here offer windows where moonlight streams through in thick beams, illuminating the wooden floor.",
