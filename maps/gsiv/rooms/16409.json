    "The road bends to avoid a gracile stone tower, its slender spire topped with a ring of peacock blue silk pennons.  A larger white silk banner is placed centrally within the cluster, embroidered with an oversized Ta'Illistim peacock and scroll.  A pale blue light leaks out of arrow slits in the tower, the glow diffuse and hazy. Around the base of the tower are flowering beds of white roses, growing in abundance, though manicured to avoid spilling into the lanes of passage.",
