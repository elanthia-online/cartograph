  "description": [
    "More a glorified closet than a storage room, the small room has a low ceiling fitted with a single brass lantern.  Brooms are arranged in a hap-hazardous pile in one curving corner, while cleaning rags and polishing cloths fill a deep blue urn to overflow.  Dustpans and brushes are scattered indiscriminately around a rattan dust bin that shows signs of recent repair and an overpowering scent of mildew fills the air."
