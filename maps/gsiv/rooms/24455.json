    "Circular in shape, the floor is completely made from square-cut sections of black marble.  Large, blackened marble pillars line the walls, ending with a domed glass ceiling high overhead.  A narrow gap on the far side of the room leads to a sweeping stairwell with a mithglin-plated door beneath it."
