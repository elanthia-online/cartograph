  "description": [
    "At the top of the tallest peak around the rim of Stormbrow the view is far and wide.  To the north a verdant isle rests on the surface of a surrounding ocean that spreads out as far as the eye can see to the west.  To the east, the blackened crater of Stormbrow cradles a roiling lava cauldron that hisses and spews sulfurous gas clouds obscuring a view of anything beyond.  Kharam Dzu can be seen to the south, split by the glittering river Maugh before it empties out to sea."
