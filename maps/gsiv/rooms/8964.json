  "description": [
    "The cobblestone lane makes a turn around the base of a stone statue.  Residences crowd around the circle's circumference, separated from the street by fitted paving stones which provide a promenade.  An enormous statue stands in the center of the circle, and with its up-raised hand and animated expression it appears to hold the audience of buildings in thrall."
