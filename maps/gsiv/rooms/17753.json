  "description": [
    "The base of the guild complex is sunken some ten feet below the ground, where a huge black ring-wall of coralline limestone frames an ornately arched doorway.  The great arch is delved in the stone wall, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron and mithril.  They are wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, so that when unbarred, they could be moved easily by a single man."
