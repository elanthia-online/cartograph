    "Perched high above the main decking, the view offered from the polished brass railings of the forecastle stretches off many leagues toward the horizon.  A tall, cypress foremast dominates the space, while a long cylindrical bowsprit extends out over the choppy waters below.  To each side of the spacious decking, a set of coral-dusted stairs descends further into the vessel's depths."
