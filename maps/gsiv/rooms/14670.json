    "Large blocks of black-veined red granite form a semicircle here.  Each has been carved with images from ancient history -- drakes aloft battling ur-daemons, Arkati walking the land as teachers, the peoples of the land beginning their civilizations.  In the center of the stones is a small steel and brass fountain."
