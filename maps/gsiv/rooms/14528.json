    "An umbrella thorn acacia spreads its wide, flat-topped crown across the path, creating a large spot of shade.  The tree itself is covered in long, straight spines and smaller, hooked spines, both which grow side by side in erratic patterns.  White puffball flowers dot the ends of gnarled branches, hidden within the leaflets that sprout from long central ribs."
