  "description": [
    "A nauseating stench permeates the fetid air in this section of the cavern.  Algae mats and a layer of black mold make the steep pathways here treacherous.  Only a few widespaced handholds carved into the limestone surround make the return climb to the higher levels possible.  A bright and glittering light to the southeast makes a vague promise of a more inviting environment."
