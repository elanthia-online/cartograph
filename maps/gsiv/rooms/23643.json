    "Rising above the rest of the ship, the sterncastle allows for an overview of the entire upper deck.  The large ship's wheel stands above the tiller and is bolted to a blackened iron plate.  Copper bands set into the wheel-spokes shimmer softly in the ambient light and show signs of recent polishing."
