  "description": [
    "Rounding a curve, the tunnel shrinks into a passageway barely wide enough to accommodate a single giant.  The ceiling is low as well, with sharp stones projecting down from it.  In the half-light, they take on the appearance of jagged teeth.  In many places the protruding stones have been carved with faces, the features distorted and grotesque.  They gaze down from above with expressions of despair, horror and outrage."
