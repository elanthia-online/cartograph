    "The odor of wet mud and mold fills the chill air, and the sound of flowing water echoes through the cavern.  Two stalactite-stalagmite pairs bracket the trail.  The stalactites have been hollowed out, polished, and inset with a glowing sunstone each.  The stonecrafted spotlights shine down upon statues carved from the stalagmites beneath them: pair of dwarven warriors, one bearing a clawed gauntlet and the other a two-handed morning star, guarding the trail."
