    "The long cabin is paneled in polished modwir and shining brass lamps hang from the ceiling, their reflective surfaces adorning the dark interior like jewelry.  Along the portside bulkhead is a low bar, finely crafted in the same richly veined wood and being polished by a halfling.  Heaping baskets of tarts are spaced at regular intervals along it.  In the chamber's center sits a small wooden platform, looking for all the world like a performance stage."
