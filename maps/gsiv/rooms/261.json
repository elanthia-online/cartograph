    "Loud clanging noises come from the yard to one side of the road.  The yard is enclosed by a tall iron gate, welded to which is a peculiar sign in the shape of a horseshoe with crossed hammer and tongs upon it.  Along the side of the street, dumped unceremoniously by the gate, is a heap of coal and a pile of dark-colored rocks."
