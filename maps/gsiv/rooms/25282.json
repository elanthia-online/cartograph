  "description": [
    "The light from a single torch and a couple of candles illuminates this medium sized room decorated in rich maoral wood.  Across from an unmade giantman's double bed, a bookcase filled with books on healing arts takes up nearly the entire wall.  To the left of the bookcase a complete skeleton hangs, its jaw slack.  To the right a wood-framed picture hangs slightly off center.  Beyond, a window has been left open, its curtains dancing slightly in the breeze."
