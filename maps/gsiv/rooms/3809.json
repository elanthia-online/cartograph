    "The blended odors of ale, sweat, leather, perfume and hearty stew fill the stifling air of the tavern.  Disheveled regulars and road-weary travelers rub elbows at the wooden bar, which looks recently varnished but already bears a variety of stains and grime.  Helga, the ancient, obese proprietor, moves behind the bar, wiping glasses with a dirty towel as she keeps a beady eye on the patrons.  A small fireplace in one corner burns feebly, adding little light or warmth to the room."
