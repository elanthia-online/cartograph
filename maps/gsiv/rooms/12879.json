    "The break in the fence and the broken lantern post mark the end of the road to the south.  The path that leads north to the orchard has become overgrown with the thick, blighted foliage that creeps ever closer to the town.  A tipped-over wheelbarrow has been shoved off to the side of the road, its wheel chipped and cracked."
