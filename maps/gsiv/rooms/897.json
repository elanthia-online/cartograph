    "Bits of gravel and small stones have been cleared to the sides of the tunnel in a nonsensical fashion, their origin unknown.  Although uneven, the walls of the tunnel are mainly smooth, with a small protrusion or shallow pock in some places.  A few old, yellowed bones, perhaps from a large rat, lie amidst the rocky debris."
