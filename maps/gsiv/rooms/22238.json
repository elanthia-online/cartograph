    "A cobblestone walkway forms a circle around a magnificent granite hawk statue that dominates the center of the plaza.  Visitors kneel around the sculpture and murmur hushed prayers, while others lay sticks and branches around its base.  Clay pots filled with blossoming foliage decorate the area, and small wooden benches offer a place of rest."
