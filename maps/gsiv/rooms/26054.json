  "description": [
    "Careful cultivation made this willow into a functional platform.  The trunk and its adjoining branches grow right into the wood plank edges.  Silk pillows have been scattered about the lofty retreat to add a touch of comfort.  Looking out across the landscape, Seethe Naedal rises high to the west, its domed observatory aglow in the moonlight.  To the east, a pair of bridges, one light and one dark, hover in the air above the city, creating visual markers that lead directly to the Sapphire Gate far below."
