    "A twisted iron sconce hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a mistwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  An elegantly dressed maiden statue sits in one corner of a mistwood plank floor.  There is a series of low oak shelves on one side of the shop and a brass treasure chest on the other."
