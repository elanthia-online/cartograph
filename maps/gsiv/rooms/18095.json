    "Saffron silk sheets alternated with azure line the walls in this section of the tent, which is separated from the showroom by a beaded tent flap.  Copper lanterns fitted with stained glass windows twirl from their anchor in the rafters and create a prismatic spray of bright light that dances upon the ceiling and walls.  Beneath the dazzling display is a ring of plump tangerine cushions and a low maoral table with carved floral legs."
