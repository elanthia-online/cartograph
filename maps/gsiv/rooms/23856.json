    "Nestled into the large trunk of a hollow cedar tree, this small space is surprisingly cool and inviting.  Several iron-latticed lanterns hang from the smooth walls, casting a warm glow around the room.  Along the back wall are a row of wooden pegs and a shallow niche.  The floor is covered in a thick layer of cedar shavings, the slightest disturbance sending their heady scent into the air.  Several depressions have been carved into one side wall, creating a ladder which leads upward."
