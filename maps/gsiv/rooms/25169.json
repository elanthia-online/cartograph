    "Swathes of ebon silk, more akin to tattered ribbons than to banners of any sort, run the length of the sandstone walls like ragged fingers of shadow.  Loose grains of sand and broken pieces of turquoise lay in a scattered pile along the ground.  Whistling wind tears at the compound from outside, hissing shrilly in through a small crack in the glass dome above."
