    "The broad sweep of the mahogany floor is interrupted by a brass flowerpot.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the blue watered silk walls.  A vine-carved mahogany table and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
