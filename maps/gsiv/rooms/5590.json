    "A large, arched doorway framed in polished monir leads to the interior of the guildhall.  To one side a staircase with an ebony-and-brass banister leads up to the second floor.  An elegantly painted sign resembling a brilliant cut ruby the size of a melon hangs above the foot of the stairs.  A small notice is posted next to the stairs."
