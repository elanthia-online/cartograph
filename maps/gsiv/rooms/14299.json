    "A scant few sparkles on the shadowed ground reveal shards of stained glass scattered in front of an abandoned cafe.  A twisted brass stool lies in a heap in the middle of the road, having apparently been thrown through the second story window.  Only the building's boarded up facade remains, as the red bricks of its other walls have long since fallen to the unforgiving ground.",
