    "Heaps of trunks, cartons, and chests are tucked between large cases around the perimeter of this ample, circular room.  As the torchlight plays upon their surfaces, the warding runes upon their bindings glow softly.  A long, low counter is set in the midst of the clutter, on which rests a collection of pens, inkpots, and ledgers."
