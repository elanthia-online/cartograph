    "A cobbled walk meanders through an imposing arch.  Across the arch's top are living quarters featuring multiple chimneys and windows with diamond-shaped panes, some tinted rich shades of ruby and blue.  Trees frame the stone building and high stone walls stretch away to either side.  The bottom of an iron portcullis is visible at the top of the archway.",
