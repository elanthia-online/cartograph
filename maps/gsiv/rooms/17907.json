    "Smooth marble walls speckled with mica that glimmers slightly in the ambient light form a sharp curve in this section of the hallway.  Situated in the corner are several heavy pots filled with lichen and toadstools, creating a tiny subterranean garden that is luminescent in varying shades of blue and green.  A shadowed alcove harbors the small landing to a dark, descending stairway."
