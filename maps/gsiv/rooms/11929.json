    "A large patch of shriveled vegetation is encircled by a guard of blackened tree trunks.  The tallest of the trees has been split in two by the lightning bolt that scarred its neighbors.  Half the trunk remains standing while the other half rests, twisted and rotting, in a cradle of burned out undergrowth."
