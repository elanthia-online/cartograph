    "Banyan trees and verdant flowering vines ring the cobbled flagstones of a small glade.  Half obscured by foliage on the glade's far side stands a tall stone wall that frames an arched, vultite-banded door.  The vultite is not the door's only guard.  Perched on a stone outcrop above is a large, black-plumed hawk.  His demeanor appears as menacing as his impressive size and talons, as he surveys the glade's perimeter with a predatory gaze."
