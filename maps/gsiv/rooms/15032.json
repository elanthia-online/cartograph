    "A fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the polished oak walls, and a varnished golden oak ceiling rises overhead.  An alabaster bathing maiden statue sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a carved oak table on one side of the shop and an elegantly carved oak armoire on the other."
