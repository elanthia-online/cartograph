    "Abandoned machinery, clearly decades old, lies scattered about in this chamber.  Apparently, their owners just dropped them where they stood as they hastily vacated the area.  Along the western wall, a small, mostly rusted cart lies on its side.  Hordes of small gelatinous creatures slither and squirm about on the inside of the cart.  An old, woebegone door stands slightly ajar."
