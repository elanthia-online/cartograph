    "Naturally formed, a ragged scar provides egress from the small alcove and stretches from the rough granite floor to the distant, dripping ceiling.  Tangles of vines, rubbery kelp, and barnacles reflect the ambient light that spills in from the outside world, while tiny scratching sounds hint at tiny denizens amid the craggy rocks.  A splintered bit of driftwood is imbedded into the wall, its rough body too distant to reach."
