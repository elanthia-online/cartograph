    "Numerous counters and boxes prominently display colorful dyes in varying hues and shades in this pristine white room.  A large colorfully spotted rug is central to the room, where many colors may have been tried out to see if the color was the perfect hue.  Large vases filled with a plethora of iceblossoms are set in each corner, adding to the coziness of the room."
