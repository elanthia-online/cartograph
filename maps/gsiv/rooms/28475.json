  "description": [
    "Tiny chains dangle from the ceiling, suspending several metal skeletons in various states of completion.  An extensive assortment of metalworking tools are haphazardly stored in steel trays set upon the stacks of boxes arranged around the workshop.  Hastily scrawled design sketches have been tacked along the walls, covering up most of the space.  Resting upon a wobbly, three-legged stool is a pile of sweat-stained rags."
