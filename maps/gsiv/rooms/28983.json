  "description": [
    "Mother-of-pearl is inlaid into an enormous seashell that acts as the backdrop to a copper and porcelain fountain that is built into the southeastern corner of the alcove.  Navy and cerulean blue hues blend together upon the surrounding walls to lend the space a wavy appearance, while frosted globes can be glimpsed from their position behind a gauzy midnight blue sheet tacked to the ceiling, their flickering lights reminiscent of sunlight dancing in water.  A faint scent of lotus blossoms dances through the air."
