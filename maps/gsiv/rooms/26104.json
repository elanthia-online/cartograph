    "[The Blue Phoenix Pub]"

  "description": [
    "Grey brick walls comprise the foundation of the spacious tavern, where oak tables and chairs are set up around the common area.  A plump boar is set near a large red brick fireplace, the roaring flames roasting the pig and warming the tavern.  Mounted on a far wall is a huge silver tapestry depicting the image of a rising blue phoenix.  From behind a brass-railed countertop, a scar-faced bartender pours drinks for the guests."
