    "A look to the cavern ceiling above reveals a few odd rippling masses of lichen overhead.  The huge growth glows with an eerie green tint, and the illumination creates some very odd shadows upon the ground.  All in all, it's a rather serene spot save for the half-buried skeleton protruding from the sand."
