    "A distinct path cuts across the small cavern, leading to a massive iron gate framed by banners.  Every stalagmite in the area has been carved into an animal form, creating a menagerie of Elanthian fauna.  Towering, luminescent toadstools line the outer wall of the guild in alternating hues of white and blue."
