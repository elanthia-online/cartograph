  "description": [
    "Flowing swiftly by the bank, the fast-moving river sweeps past, carrying debris and floatsam away and out of sight.  A cool breeze blows constantly through the narrow confines of the ravine, tugging at the leaves of a brown weed clinging to the surface of a small ledge.  Piled up at the base of the ravine's walls are small drifts of sand, intermixed with broken limbs and large stones."
