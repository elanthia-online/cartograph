  "description": [
    "All but the most diminutive of races are well advised to duck their heads while traversing the sodden sand beneath the low-to-the-ground pier.  The shallow footings of the short pilings struggle to support the weight of the walkway overhead.  Carcasses of wharf rats lay exposed upon the gravelly sand, inviting flies and scavengers to feast upon the corpses."
