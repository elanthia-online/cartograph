    "The pebbled path leads you to a grassy hillock overlooking the creek.  The creek bank here is rather steep.  At the water's edge is a small half moon of pebbles...blue, green and brown...flanked by reeds and cattails.  To the north you can see a small footbridge crossing the creek.  Tied to a limb of a tall oak tree is a length of hempen rope."
