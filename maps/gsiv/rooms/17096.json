    "Woody vines twist and turn along the redwood walls of Guild Master Haurce's office, forming shelves and benches as if commanded into those shapes by unknown magic.  Windows placed in three of the walls allow moonlight to filter liberally into the room, while torches blaze in the corners to supplement the light.  A small desk constructed from rough-hewn sheets of burl oak rests against one wall with a wooden stool sitting next to it.  Many footprints are visible on the dirt floor."
