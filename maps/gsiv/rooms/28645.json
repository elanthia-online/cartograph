    "Water pools around you, caressing your skin like warm silk.  Bits of silver set into the tub walls flicker in and out in the candlelight, and the golden flames play across the water's surface like a sea of fire.  Sponges, scrub brushes and soap all sit within easy reach along the edge, and the back of the basin slopes gently, making a perfect place to lean and soak."
