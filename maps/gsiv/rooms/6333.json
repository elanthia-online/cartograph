    "A brass candelabra and small fireplace light up the small comfortable room.  A few comfortable chairs and a small sofa are arranged to catch the warmth of the fire that dispels the night chill.  Except for quill and ink, there is only a brass lamp upon an otherwise immaculate desk.  The floor is covered with plush carpets and the walls with rich tapestries.",
