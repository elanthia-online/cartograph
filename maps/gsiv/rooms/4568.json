    "The night chill gives the always-cold air a cruel bite that stabs through your clothing like a knife.  Pale moonlight bounces off sheets of ice, elongating shadows and illuminating drifts of opalescent snow.",
    "Harsh sunlight blazes here, though in this rarefied air it provides no heat.  The unforgiving cold and the whipping wind stave off any warmth the sun could provide.  The bright light itself is painful as it bounces off the mirror-intensity ice and snow."
