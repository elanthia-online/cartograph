    "Bright yellow and orange flowers, their colors muted by the lack of sunlight, grow abundantly from window boxes attached to each dwelling that lines the street.  The display is almost overdone, as each resident attempts to best his neighbor in the display of color.",
    "Small houses crowd together along the var, each one small but neat.  A few tiles on one building's roof have clearly been replaced, as their sapphire hue is an order brighter than the rest of the street's lapis.  The stoops are clean and the cobblestones are tended, despite the center of the road being slightly more worn than the edges."
