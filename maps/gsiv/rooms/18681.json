    "Dwarf evergreens lend their shade to the delicate twists and turns of the garden.  Large boulders draped with pink-budded fetterbushes stand out amid white-striped lily turf and crimson monkey grass along the northern edges of the pebble path, while a narrow streambed trickles into a koi pond lined with tufts of dwarf bamboo.  Splashes of color generated by the flowering presence of azaleas and crimson ginger blossoms create interest near some smooth round stones.",

Large boulders draped with pink-budded fetterbushes stand out amid white-striped lily turf and crimson monkey grass along the northern edges of the pebble path, while a narrow streambed trickles into a koi pond lined with tufts of dwarf bamboo.  Flanking a series of smooth stone steps, bright azaleas and crimson ginger blossoms bloom on one side, while a stone-lined bed of colorful flowers dominates the other.  Resting on the edge of one pale step is a small earthenware bowl."
