    "This section of hallway is fitted with richly-veined marble and oak floors that complement the polished oak wainscotting.  Pale shafts of sunlight pass through the deep blue glaesine windows, casting this space in an otherworldly hue.  A plain granite arch has the beginnings of some carvings near the floor, but it appears that the stonemasons stopped work soon after beginning.",
