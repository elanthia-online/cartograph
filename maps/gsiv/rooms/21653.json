    "Sets of bunk beds and small tables are lined up against the western and eastern walls of the room and take up fully half the space available.  In the remaining area are a variety of chairs, couches, and cushions scattered around haphazardly.  A long fireplace occupies the south wall, radiating its warmth far into the room."
