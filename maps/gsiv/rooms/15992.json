    "You are in a small circular stone landing.  Dripping copper colored stains adorn the walls looking as if someone had thrown buckets of blood on them.  A cut-stone spiral staircase wraps around the circular walls leading further up into what must be the castle keep.  A rusty iron ladder leads down a passage cut into the floor.",
