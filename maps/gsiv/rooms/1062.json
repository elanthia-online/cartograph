    "Thick grass grows as far as the eye can see, which isn't very far in the gloomy mist.  The grass extends several feet high and is a dark grey broken here and there by small patches of lighter grey blades.  Brighter spots on the glowing mists overhead indicates the positions of the moons, and enough light filters down to make it easy to see the partially trampled path that serves as a trail across this moor.",

The grass extends several feet high and is a deep green broken here and there by small patches of light green and yellow blades.
