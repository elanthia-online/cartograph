    "A chandelier provides sufficient visibility while the light plays off the vaulted ceiling.  An iron balustrade spans the wide balcony overlooking the gallery below.  Heavy cherrywood bookshelves span the full length of the wall opposing the balustrade, their repository of texts accessible by a rolling ladder.  The stucco walls are embedded with fragments of colorful sea glass and striated clam shells.  A pair of red velvet chairs, separated by a modest low table, are stowed away at the far corner."
