    "This long, covered passageway, entered at either end through carved ironwood gates featuring a pair of intricately carved dragons, runs between the road and a large inner courtyard.  The space is lit by rush lamps set into the whitewashed walls, and shadows flicker along its length.  A faint, though not unpleasant, musty odor permeates the night.  Sounds from outside are muffled by the walls and the enclosing darkness.  The faces of those who pass by are barely discernible."
