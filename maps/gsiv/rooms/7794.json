    "A large cave spider scurries into an attack position far above your head.  Though not nearly as big as the great spiders that can be found near the sea, it is still of sufficient size to inject a lethal dose of venom.  Bound securely in its huge web are the silent corpses of several creatures that learned this lesson far too late."
