    "Sunlight streams though the branches of four weeping willow trees that provide a canopy for the natural pond.  An abundance of verdant ferns and colorful wildflowers circle the edge, broken by a flat, table-like rock and a small cobblestone pathway that leads back to the garden.  Wisps of steam rise up from the naturally heated pond glistening as rays from above hit the surface.  Situated about the bottom are several stones, perfect for sitting and relaxing in the mineral rich warm water."
