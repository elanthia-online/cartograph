    "A small cliff, perhaps produced by an earthquake long ago, stretches along to the east.  The trail moves alongside this obstacle as if searching for a way over it or around it.  The forest is sparse and open to the sky in many places, allowing the moons to shine brightly through.  Patches of dandelions cover the ground in many areas, their light grey flowers clustered closely to produce the appearance of grey throw rugs tossed randomly throughout the woods.",
