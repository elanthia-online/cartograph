    "Spanning several feet, a long wooden plank has been repurposed and painted into a blue and seafoam green shelf supported by empty rum barrels.  A thin teakwood tray rests atop a wave-painted table along with a glass jug filled with seashells.  Beyond a rather plain-looking steel rack, a cuphea-edged layered linen curtain obscures what lies to the west."
