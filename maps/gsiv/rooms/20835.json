    "Secured by a massive stone wall, this spacious courtyard is a welcome retreat.  A deep fire pit encircled by black stones fills the area with warmth.  An old, dried-up cobblestone well sits alongside a stone bench.  Posted near the gigantic drawbridge is an oak signpost staked into the ground.  A massive gnarled oak tree with grey threadlike moss hanging from its branches rests in the midst.  A winding cobblestone path guides travelers to the torch-lit stairs, the entrance to the Dreadnaught tavern, and beyond."
