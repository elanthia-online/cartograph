  "description": [
    "Flowing curtains of oxblood and obsidian velvet cover the walls of the wagon, leaving lit black iron sconces to cast macabre shadows across the spire-framed rack set against at the back of the shop.  A tall jet marble altar, framed by sanguine-stained bowls, sits within the center of the room, carved with flora in various stages of decay."
