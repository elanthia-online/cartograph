    "A distinctive manor stands well back from the var, set off by a low greystone wall.  Constructed of polished, dark grey granite, the circular structure has dozens of round windows at various heights along the wall.  A palisade of black granite pillars circles the building, holding aloft a gently sloping slate roof."
