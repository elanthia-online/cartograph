  "description": [
    "The hall of arms ends here, with each parallel wall subtly converging into a semicircle marked by a heavy wooden door with dark metal hinges and reinforced with darkened studs.  The flickering light emanating from the sconces on the empty walls barely reaches the door, giving it a slightly foreboding appearance."
