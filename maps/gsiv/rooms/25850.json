    "Crushed white shells wind a sinuous path through the foliage to the distant docks, their pearly interiors glistening in the sunlight.  Cultivated vines twine up trellises along the northern edge of the island and provide a protective barrier that guards against the dangers of the cliffs beyond them.  Bushes, surrounded by small fences, produce a variety of berries that are ripe for the picking."
