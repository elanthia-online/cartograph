    "White silk-paneled walls rise from an intricate patterned floor.  Just above a glass-fronted bookcase hangs a wrinkled parchment gown pattern, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling completes the picture.  A heavy lead glass display case and a silk-covered dress mannequin stand side by side in the middle of the room."
