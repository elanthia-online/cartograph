    "Deep shadows have collected where one of the braziers bolted to the slab walls of the hallway has fallen dim, creating a pocket of darkness upon the stone slabs of the floor.  Overhead, the high ceiling is lost to view.  The hallway stretches away to east and west, its expanse a hollow cavern that would dwarf a mammoth."
