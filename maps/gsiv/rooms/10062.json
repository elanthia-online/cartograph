    "The walls of the tunnel are marked with deep mars and scratches, as if someone had once tried to extend the passage in a hurried and disorganized manner.  Narrow crevices break the hard-packed soil of the floor, emitting wisps of the same unnaturally glowing mist that drifts over the moors above.  Bones of various types lie scattered across the floor, in a random fashion which suggests that they were not buried here but died here."
