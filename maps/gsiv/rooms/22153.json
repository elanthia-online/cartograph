  "description": [
    "Covered in white sheets, several pieces of large furniture are stored along the walls.  The sizes and shapes suggest beds, tables, chairs and a lumpy, misshapen sofa.  The pile's stair-like pattern leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.  Tiny prints in the dusty floor suggest that a family of mice have taken up residence in the small spaces and hidden nooks of the attic."
