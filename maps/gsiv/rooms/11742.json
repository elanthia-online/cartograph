    "Somber murals surround this chamber where the stone paved floor has sunk several feet below the doorway leading back out into the vaulted room.  All but for a few paces of floor remain, the rest has quietly succumbed to a rising pool of black water that dominates most of the room.  Occasionally, something causes the water to ripple as unseen things stir beneath the surface."
