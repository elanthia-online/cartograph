    "Built into one corner of the garden is a wide marble fountain that is supported on two sides by the corner of the inn's walls.  Parakeets and larks bath within the bright blue waters amongst the water lilies that grow within, while sunlight glitters off of the curves of the statue that rises out of the basin.",
