    "[First Mate's Cabin]"

  "description": [
    "Smaller by half than the captain's quarters beside it,  the cabin of the first mate is still roomier than that of the average sailor aboard.  A quilt-covered bed with turned oak posts takes up one wall, while an inviting sitting area, a small desk, and a collection of map cases are spread throughout the rest of the space.  A soft, blue woolen carpet covers the floor boards with a perfectly porpoise-shaped hole cut completely out of the middle of the weave."
