    "This high chamber is a madman's travesty of a throne room in purgatory.  On a dais sits an eldritch throne inlaid with the ivory of human bones.  The walls are carved with gut-wrenching scenes of sub-human figures dancing and gibbering with hellish glee under constellations you have never seen.  Behind the throne is a tapestry whose subject turns your stomach."
