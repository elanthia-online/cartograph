    "Dappled sunlight filters through the tall leaded-glass windows that illumine the narrow corridors between the bookshelves that fill this long room.  Volumes fill each shelf, ranging from tiny part-books on the uppermost shelves to giant folios at the bottom.  By the door, behind an immaculately tidy desk, sits an old bespectacled elf who appears to be engaged in some obscure exercise in alphabetizing."
