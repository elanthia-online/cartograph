    "The low ceiling of this small establishment is painted a pure white, its immaculately polished surface inlaid with golden runes in a circular pattern.  Ivory tiles are set into the floor, leading north toward a large brazier set upon a raised circular ledge that continually casts the scent of lotus to the air.  Dark wooden shelves line the walls, filled with various potions and other items of religious interest."
