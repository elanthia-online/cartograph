  "description": [
    "A broad angle of limb forms a natural perch in the lower reaches of the beech's crown, though the ground is still an alarming distance below.  Yet, with its smooth bark, stately posture and oval leaves like soft green eyes, there is an air of comfort in the tree, as though being cradled in the strong arms of a friendly giant."
