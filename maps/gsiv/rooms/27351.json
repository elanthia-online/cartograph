    "The scent of pine is strong here, but works in concert with the decor of this efficient store.  A dusting of snow covers every flat surface, falling off the edges in a frozen tableau.  Wide green shelves line the walls, festooned with nooks and crannies of every imaginable shape and size.  Despite the amount of storage, not a single space is unoccupied.  Halfling attendants scurry about, assisting customers as needed, but remaining busy with any number of small tasks."
