  "description": [
    "Serving a dual purpose, this little alcove offers a small amount of respite from the flurry of activity in the main room.  Tucked in one corner, a porcelain washbasin perched on a gold pedestal rests near a white cotton cloth on a small, brushed steel hook and a cedar waste bin.  Hung above the basin, a vaalin-framed oval mirror allows for a moment of vanity.  Reflected in the mirror's polished surface is a tall closet that stands just inside the golden oak arch framing the view of the room outside."
