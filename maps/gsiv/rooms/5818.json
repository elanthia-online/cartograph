  "description": [
    "The air smells of horses, but faintly as if none have passed this way too recently.  A fine sifting of sand coats the sloping floor where it meets the walls and the rock above you is almost completely hidden by a maze of crossbeams.  Metal bolts holding the beams to the ceiling and to each other reflect the wan light of distant lanterns.  The floor slants sharply down to the southwest."
