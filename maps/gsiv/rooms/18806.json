    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an uneven wooden ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of a glossy black ebonwood floor.  There is an intricately carved ebonwood stand on one side of the shop and a gold-veined black marble counter on the other."
