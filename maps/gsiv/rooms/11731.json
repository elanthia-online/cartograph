    "Smooth black stone provide the foundation for the widening walls of the hallway, rising halfway up before being replaced by roughly hewn granite blocks.  Much the ground is bathed in darkness with the only light coming from the north and the south.  Sounds echo off the stone walls as someone or something else stirs elsewhere in the dungeon, followed by a loud clanging noise.",
