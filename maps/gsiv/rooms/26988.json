    "Awash in tenebrous shadows, the landscape is in constant turmoil from the consistent bombardment of small meteorites that pummel the onyx energy dome above.  Lunar dust explodes in the air with each impact, the fine powder gently raining upon the protective shield and causing it to pulse with expanding rings before normalizing between each impact.  Grey and black light are at war for dominance, though the steady light of a nearby glass-lined ring keeps the golden tile path well illuminated."
