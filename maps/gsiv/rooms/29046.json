  "description": [
    "Lapping waves create a rhythmic sound as they slap against the support posts of the pier, the resulting spray slicking the edges of the pier's wooden floorboards.  Black rope is woven tightly about the tall tie pilings that decorate the western and eastern sides, the U-shaped clamps used to bind them to the pier clinking and clacking with the sway of the tide.  Crisp white letters adorn a black board, the concise script proclaiming \"Pier 2 - Slips 16-20."
