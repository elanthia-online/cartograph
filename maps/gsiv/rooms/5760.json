    "This enormous space was opened out of the mountain by the work of the stonecutters.  Flatbed rail cars loaded with granite lie on a small portion of intact railway, while various hammers, chisels, and other tools sit in steel buckets nearby.  An enormous sculpture fills the center of the room."
