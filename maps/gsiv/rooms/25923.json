    "A scribe's desk sits before a cushioned wooden bench in the center of the room.  Behind it, a long row of cabinets is topped by books, ledgers, and scrolls.  A tall door has been wedged open by a wooden block, though the boxes that threaten to spill out would likely be enough to keep the door from closing."
