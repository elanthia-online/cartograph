    "A tangle of rose bushes grows up from the rocks of the cliff face to the southeast.  Red roses grow amongst the bushes, protected by long, thick thorns.",
    "The ocean crashes ceaselessly against the rocks of the cliff face below, spraying sea water as high as the tops of the cliffs.  As each wave blows a spray of mist into the air, a rainbow forms momentarily above the cliffs."
