    "Stiff, cold gusts swirl through in a wild dance, lifting shriveled leaves and tossing them haphazardly about the road.  A single farmhouse stands nearby, and a small barn or shed is being constructed beside it.  A small wooden boat bobs up and down on the otherwise still surface of a small pond, its surface splotched with a black mold."
