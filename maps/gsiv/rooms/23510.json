    "With little more space than a closet, this tiny alcove holds a series of floor-to-ceiling shelves with overflow stock that likely did not fit out in the main room.  Oddly, the garments in this room have a distinctly feminine flavor, which might explain why they are not out on display.  A low opening provides escape, while a tiny glowing orb has been set in the ceiling to give a speck of lighting to this otherwise claustrophobic space."
