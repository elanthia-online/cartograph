    "Shelves line the rafters, held in place by heavy wooden braces to support the oaken barrels lined up neatly atop them.  Each of the barrels has a broken wagon wheel branded on the outward facing end, along with a date that, from this distance, isn't distinguishable.  A giant copper vat sits on the far side of building among several other smaller containers, with both straight and coiled tubing running between them.  On the opposite side of the structure is a long ebonwood table with a gold-edged runner and a black iron bottle rack."
