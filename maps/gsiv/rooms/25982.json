    "Crafted from frosted crystal, a trio of globes hanging from copper chains illuminate the room.  A large wardrobe of clothing covers one wall while a polished linden chest filled with shoes and boots covers another.  Centered on the thick ivory wool carpet is a hammered brass rack of coats, cloaks, and other outer garments."
