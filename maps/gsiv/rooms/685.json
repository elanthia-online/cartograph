    "A sturdy stone cottage rests at the end of the trail, its red tiled roof providing a cheerful contrast to the deep browns and greys of the stone walls.  A wooden cart sits to one side of the cottage, filled to the brim with wooden boxes and chests.  A brightly painted sign hangs beside the cottage's front door, illuminated by the light falling from a single window cut into the wall nearby.",
