    "Sunlight streams in liberally across the road through a large break in the conifer canopy.  An ancient fir tree has collapsed and taken a large number of lesser trees down with it.  Fortunately the old one chose to fall away from the road, rather than across it, allowing travel to continue unobstructed.  Now the huge trunk lies in the soft ground, relentlessly attacked by the elements and insects that will eventually return it to the soil from which it sprang.",
