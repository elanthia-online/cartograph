    "A plush dark green rug covers the majority of the plank flooring.  Spanning across the far wall, a wide four-poster bed carved from thick cedar is dressed with pale green and white bedding.  Issuing a shadowy, flickering illumination, copper sconces are lit with dim flames, several of which are clustered around a narrow door.  Behind a tall armchair and a rustic table, lacy curtains are pulled across a section of the solid wall, as if a window once existed in the framework."
