  "description": [
    "The eldest of the yews here have grown into a great canopy, almost blotting out the sky.  Great shadows play through their branches, dancing over the tower steps.  The dim lights on the rough exterior walls give a very somber tone to the entrance here.  A small path parts the wall of foliage, carrying the faint sound of trickling water."
