    "A powerful stench overwhelms you as you step inside the cave.  Rotting animal carcasses lie scattered about the dirt floor, below a bloodstained crude stone altar.  Pelts of various sizes and shapes cover walls marked with odd scratchings, and you shudder as your gaze falls on one that looks quite a bit like the remains of a halfling."
