    "A huge formation of gray and white rocks bursts from the ground to the north of the path here.  The base of the formation is huge, and the tops of the rocks reach as high as the tallest of the young trees in the area.  Moss and lichen grow on the rocks in damp crannies and crevices, hidden from the moonlight.",
