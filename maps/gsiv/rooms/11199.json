    "This looks to have been a very nice place to hang your hat, at one time.  Now all the furniture has been destroyed or looted, leaving nothing of value behind.  A skeleton lies on what remains of the bed, the skull crushed beyond recognition, and a dark stain covers the remaining bedding and the wall."
