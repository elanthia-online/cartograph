  "description": [
    "Large and small totems, some stacked as tall as a giantman, decorate the lawn of a small shop set back from the edges of the cobblestone road.  Twin walruses fashioned of elm hold a pine mermaid aloft in their tusks, the grinning passenger lies on her back with one hand on her stomach and the other hanging limp with a white seashell-shaped sign clutched in hand.  Lanterns are strategically placed along the lane to provide the best possible nighttime illumination, though during the day they are dormant."
