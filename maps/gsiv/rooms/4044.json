    "A large candle burns with a steady flame in each corner of this room.  Various forms of artwork adorn the walls of this chamber, each representing one of the Gods of Elanthia.  One particular object, a long black tapestry, attracts your attention.  A small chair sits next to the tapestry and seated in this chair is the hooded figure of a man."
