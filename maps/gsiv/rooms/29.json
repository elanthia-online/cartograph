    "The var widens as it meets the bustling Shimmarglin Court, its cobblestones worn smooth by ages of traffic.  Lanterns hung from ironwork posts light the way with a gentle amber glow.  On either side of the var, groupings of flowering trees and hydrangea bushes bursting with delicate blue and lavender blooms nod gently at the passersby.",

    "The var widens as it meets the Shimmarglin Court, its cobblestones worn smooth and slick by ages of traffic.  On either side of the roadway, groupings of flowering trees and rose bushes bursting with delicate white blooms cluster together, fighting for precious space.  Several vines worth of flowers have curled up and around the posts of a series of silver and glass lanterns."
