    "Chisel marks are evident in the sloping walls enclosing this space, and the air is weighted with humidity and the scent of earth.  A wide platform carved from the far wall is padded by a plush mattress, with a folded satin-covered quilt laid at the foot.  In a niche nearby, an oil lamp burns dimly, issuing the scent of valerian, and an aged teak writing desk sits on the wall opposite."
