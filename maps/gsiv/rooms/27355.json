  "description": [
    "The corner of the wagon opens to a salon exclusively dedicated to the fine art of tailoring.  Scraps of finespun muslin, spools of silken threads, and a few stray sketching papers are draped across a slender olivewood worktable at the back.  Situated nearby, an ebon rose-shaped pin cushion sprouting sharpened silver needles is poised atop a reserved collection of measuring tapes and ribbons."
