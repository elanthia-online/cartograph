    "The road snakes and winds to conform to the banks of the river.  In the distance, the low profiles of the shops and warehouses that populate the Landing's western bank can be seen.  To one side of the road, burly workmen load kegs of ale onto a flatbed wagon next to an aging warehouse, while two more wagons stand empty next to the low, cracked curb.  The span of a bridge crosses the river to the southeast."
