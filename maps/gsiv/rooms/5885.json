    "Crushed granite forms a somber path through the cemetery.  The grey of the path is in stark contrast to the verdant green grass flanking on either side.  A grave on the west side is marked by a short marble pillar.  A leafy vine winds its way around the pillar, before displaying a single white bloom at the pillar's capital.",

A grave on the west side is marked by a short marble pillar.  A leafy vine winds its way around the pillar, before displaying a single white bloom at the pillar's capital.  The bloom seems to pop out from the nighttime darkness."
