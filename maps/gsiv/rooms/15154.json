  "description": [
    "The mottled dark green and brown shell of an oversized sea turtle comprises the table in this corner of the tavern.  A chocolate linen-covered bench follows the rounded camber of the shell's perimeter, allowing for the seating of a large party.  A smaller turtle shell filled will spindly grey moss is suspended directly overhead."
