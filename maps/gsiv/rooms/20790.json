    "The floor and walls of this peaceful room are covered with white marble veined with silver that sparkles from the moonlight of an open window.  Upon a desk under the window sits a variety of reading materials, a painting of Amaltea in a heart-shaped frame and a small silver framed painting.  Two steps lead up to a landing which supports a large, four-poster bed with white silk sheets and pillows.  A tapestry hangs on the opposite wall of the bed."
