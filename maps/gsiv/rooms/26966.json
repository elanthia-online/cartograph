    "Woven together like a tapestry, the lawn that stretches from the crushed seashell pathway to the travertine walls is comprised of various species of plant.  Yellow yarrow, manicured to remain short, mingles with carpet bugle and short daisies to form the higher tiers of the sprawling lawn, while closer to the ground dog fennel, ground ivy, and creeping violets add color and texture to the mix.  Despite the plethora of plant life, nothing is sturdy enough for cultivating but the air carries a rich aroma."
