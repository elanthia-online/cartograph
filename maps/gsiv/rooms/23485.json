    "A tall fel pole stands in the center of the pavilion, supporting the silken canopy high overheard, while a plush crimson rug covers the ground below.  A polished linden display runs the length of on side of the pavilion, while a carved mahogany rack stands along the opposite side.  The back portion of the pavillion is partitioned off by an amber-beaded curtain."
