    "Trees densely covered in leaves and creeping vines surround the river as it meanders through the thickening jungle.  The riverbed of rocks gradually gives way to passable travel along either side of the foamy water, and the dampness infused into the air accentuates the ever-present mist overlaying the island.  An occasional flash of silver can be seen within the river as fish traverse its depths."
