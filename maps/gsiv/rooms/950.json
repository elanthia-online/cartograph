    "A few shriveled, scrub bushes and tufts of dying grass cling to small crevices in the rock wall, their effort to survive hampered by the chill winds and dry conditions of this desolate region.  Their bony limbs bare of fruit or leaves, the small plants have been picked clean by the foraging inhabitants of the mountain."
