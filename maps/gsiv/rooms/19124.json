    "The hold space is made to feel small with its low, concave ceiling and the chaotic arrangement of items.  A tin bucket is on its side in the middle of the floor, just next to a wide, red-patterned rug that is home to an assortment of fishing poles.  Nearly blocking the hatch leading out, a short table with stunted, uneven legs seems to defy all sense of the real world by standing completely upright."
