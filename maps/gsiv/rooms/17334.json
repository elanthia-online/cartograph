    "Thick wooden rafters the size of a troll king's arm run beneath the high arched ceiling of the great hall.  A series of pennants and battle standards hang from the beams above.  Below, a long oval table bisects the stone floor.  Rushes are thrown beneath it, and a small puppy, apparently some motley mixture of hunting breeds, lies curled up amidst them."
