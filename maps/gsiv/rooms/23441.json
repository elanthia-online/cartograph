  "description": [
    "A large, multi-colored rug covers the smooth pine boards that stretch across the floor.  Swathes of colorful linen tapestries line the walls, dappled with silvery beams of moonlight seeping through a small porthole.  A pair of female mannequins, one slender and one rotund, stand opposite a curtain-draped doorway.  The air has a vaguely perfumed scent, which doesn't quite cover the smell of the salty sea air."
