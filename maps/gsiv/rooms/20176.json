    "[Dilapidated Party Boat]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Grand in its day, the party boat is in complete disrepair.  Most of the white paint has flaked away, and the exposed wood is mildewing.  A busted string of lights enclose the main area that once served as a dance floor.  The wooden floor sags and creaks even with the lightest of footsteps, providing a shaky barrier from the swamp underneath.  A thick, twisted rope provides both mooring and a means to venture back to the muddy road."
