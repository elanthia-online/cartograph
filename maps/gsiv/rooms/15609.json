    "Long, thin ivory columns encircle the room, marking the borders of a round disc of pure white marble, its surface streaked with veins of pale crimson.  A deep crimson rose serves as a central mural upon the lustrous marble, its dark petals crafted of thick stained glass.  A sweeping staircase adorned with rich velvet rugs leads further up, while hallways branch off to the east and west."
