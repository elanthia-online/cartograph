    "A timbered nook opens up from the hallway into a compact area.  Near the end is a heavy black iron stove with a soot-stained chimney going into the wall alongside a small woodpile.  An array of battered steel cookpots hangs above a row of hooks holding an assortment of jam-stained satchels.  A much-scarred oak chopping block covers a nearby counter, with a paper sign stuck to the wall behind it.  To one side looms a high-shelved pantry full of sacks, bottles, and crates, including one on the floor, possibly used as a footstep."
