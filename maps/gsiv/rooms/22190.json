    "A wide cobblestone walkway leads across a cultivated green lawn directly to the doors of Guardian Keep.  Flanking the walkway on either side are rows of meticulously trimmed hedges, expertly shaped to resemble a variety of creatures.  The keep itself soars three stories high, its crenellated granite walls anchored by an immense tower at its northwest corner.  To the east and west, a path leads to row upon row of dazzlingly colorful flowerbeds.  A massive iron portcullis exits to the gatehouse."
