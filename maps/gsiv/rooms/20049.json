    "A murky grey cloth-covered workbench sits against the back wall of this narrow rectangular room.  The walls are pristine and white, as is the marble floor.  At the intersection of the two, a narrow gully flows with dark red lava.  In the center of the high ceiling is a square window, through which the day's light enters."
