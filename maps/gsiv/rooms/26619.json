  "description": [
    "The planks of the pier are warped from the continuous spray of water, the rotting wood covered in a variety of pale-colored worms and slugs gripping tightly to the grains.  The immense drop-off looms along the edge of the pier, the distinct lack of light making any other direction difficult to discover.",
    "Emitting an ethereal glow, a graveyard of modwir gondolas stand out against a murky haze-filled backdrop created by the lack of proper illumination, the consistent sea spray, and the invading mists.  Pale-colored worms and slugs dig into the planks of a warped pier that sits before the lapping waves of an inky black water devoid of light.  Stretching upward and away, an uneven limestone ramp provides egress from the relative gloom of the area."
