    "Small and cramped, this cabin is brightly lit by several hooded lanterns.  A carved modwir vanity sits along the ship's hull, flanked by two small tables.  Richly embroidered wool rugs cover the rough planking of the hold, providing warmth and color.  A full-length mirror stands at attention nearby, as if ready for the Captain's inspection."
