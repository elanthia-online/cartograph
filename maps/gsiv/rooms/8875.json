    "A broken wagon wheel lies right where it fractured, in the middle of the road across a large beam it partly shoved away towards the side of the street.  Open yards come right up to the edge of the pavement, large rounded bushes marking the corners of each property.  Several houses sport bird feeders and birdbaths out front, and several feathered guests take advantage of the thoughtfulness."
