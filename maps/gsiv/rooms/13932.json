  "description": [
    "Silvery hoarbeam rafters support an intricate reed fan system over the center of the room, its wide blades turning slowly to circulate air.  Armor stands arranged throughout the small shop are set to face either each other, the counters, or the shelves, which display leather wares and fashions.  Glaesine windows framed in dark thanot stand open to the sunlight, which glints off of the vaalin latches and hinges set into the dark wood."
