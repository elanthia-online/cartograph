    "As you enter this room, the first thing you notice is that it is incredibly plain.  The walls are adorned with only a painting, an old sabre, and an old stone fireplace.  Sitting in the middle of the room is an oak table surrounded by four chairs.  The most elaborate piece of furniture by far is the bed pushed into one corner.  It looks quite comfortable and well used.  Its posts are made of an unidentifiable wood that seems to have an unnatural sheen."
