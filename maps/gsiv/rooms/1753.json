  "description": [
    "The lakeshore meets the mountainside just to the north, closing off travel in that direction entirely.  The snow pelts the area relentlessly, floating down thickly from the massed clouds and driven by the incessant wind.  The trees bend and sway, but their thick trunks have adapted to the constant motion, and they are in no danger of falling.  The sound of water lapping against a shore reaches your ears, but it's difficult to see much through the blizzard conditions."
