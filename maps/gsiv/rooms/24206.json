    "Honey-colored flames dance above braziers at the four corners of the dais, illuminating the massive sandstone altar and the nine-rayed black marble starburst that form the dais' backdrop against the enormous chamber's west wall.  Beneath the high domed ceiling, and close alongside the dais, a narrow set of marble steps leads down to the south gallery.  A set of marble stairs hugging the west wall leads down to the north gallery, and a semicircle of golden steps descends east to the main hall."
