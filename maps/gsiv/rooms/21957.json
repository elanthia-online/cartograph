    "The stone ledge rises up about the darkness of the tunnel below, opening up into a wider chamber of blackness.  No light exists, save for the eerie pale glow from the slimy worms snaking up and down the cavern walls.  Out across the ledge and the open pit of shadows, another narrow ledge is visible."
