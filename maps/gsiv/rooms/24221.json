    "The interior of this tiny hut looks more than anything like a hollowed-out stump, with chunks of decaying wood placed to cover the gaps between the rotted boards and moss hung to obscure the corners.  In bright contrast, an oil lamp hangs from the ceiling, its multiple wicks producing a glow that fills the snapdragon blossom-shaped body of the lamp and spills over to light the center of the room.  Within the pool of light rest some free-standing shelves, a small modwir rack, and a tiny wooden bin, laden with an assortment of goods.",
