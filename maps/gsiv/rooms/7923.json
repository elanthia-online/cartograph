    "The mountain trail ends here, in a peaceful glade dotted with elegant fel trees.  The beauty of their dark trunks is enhanced by silvery-green leaves which dance with each gentle breeze caressing the branches.  Thin rays of moonlight stream through the trees, grazing the tall grass like delicate fingers probing for treasure.  From somewhere nearby, you can hear the music of water tapping against stones, in an endless serenade that must surely be dedicated to the sylvan splendor of this place.",
