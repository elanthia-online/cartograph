    "A ramshackle booth stands to one side of the path, long since abandoned.  The wood of the booth is splintered with age, and it leans precipitously to one side.  The path underfoot is more gravel than dirt, and not all the rocks are rounded.  The sky overhead is dark and filled with stars seen through the treetops."
