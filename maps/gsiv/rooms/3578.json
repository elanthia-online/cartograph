    "Set before a massive stone stronghold is a landing shaped like a crescent moon.  An enormous stone altar reigns over the landing, leaving very little room to maneuver.  The wind tugs at you, forcing you to hold onto the altar to steady yourself.  The landing below you appears small and forlorn, the ancient stone stairs their only lifeline.  Behind the altar, a set of massive intricately carved ora double doors stand guard over the entrance to the stone stronghold."
