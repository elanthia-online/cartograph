  "description": [
    "Ice blue walls surround this small room that is little more than a spacious closet.  Leaning up against one wall, a small table stands beside a curved frost white doorway that leads out of the room.  Nearby, a young attendant stands ready to serve.  The focal point of the room is a swirling white and green portal framed by an oval of wrought silver.  Myriad snowflakes have been etched into the metal, each one different from the last, much like their icy inspirations."
