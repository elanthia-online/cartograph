    "The source of the loud roar of rushing water stands before you.  A waterfall, tall and majestic, plunges down from a great height into a large pool at its base.  The water cascades over the cliff face of a rocky ridge to the north and over two lower tiers, emitting a spray of mist that is carried on the wind."
