    "Snow is packed tightly between thick wooden support beams, creating a cocoon of warmth inside the snowdrift.  Several oil lamps hang from the beams, providing small pools of golden illumination on the packed snowy floor.  The sounds of music drift upward from the darkened depths of a broad curving staircase, occasionally punctuated by bursts of laughter."
