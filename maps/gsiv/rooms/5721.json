    "A pure white snowflake against a jet black background covers the floor within the semicircle formed by the three display cases in this upper chamber.  The central display case is flanked on the right and left by two glaes-paned display cases that enclose the room.  The tight woolen pile of the carpet absorbs the sound of footsteps and creates a sense of inherent luxury.  A carpeted stairway leads down to the first floor."
