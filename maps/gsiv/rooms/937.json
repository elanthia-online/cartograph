    "The tunnel opens up suddenly as the ground drops away into a deep gorge below.  Rushing water rumbles down the gorge, the sound thundering in the tunnel's mouth and bouncing off the stone walls endlessly.  A rope bridge extends across the gorge, to a ledge just visible at the bridge's far end."
