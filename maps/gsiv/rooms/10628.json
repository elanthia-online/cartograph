    "The trail climbs out of the depression, and up a steep rise, only to come to an abrupt end at a thirty-foot high wall of hawthorn.  Armed with five-inch, razor-sharp spiky thorns, the thicket prevents further travel through the forest.  From within its depth, a variety of scratching and snuffling noises suggest that small animals thrive within the brambles' protective embrace."
