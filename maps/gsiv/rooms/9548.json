    "Vertical, black walls hem in the area on the east, south and west sides. The flow of bones descends from the north and northwest but does not quite reach the boundary walls.  The granite floor of the cavern is exposed here and proves to be no different in composition than the walls.  Many of the bones lie scattered across the floor instead of neatly bunched up with the others, as if someone or something has come through, kicking the bones around as it proceeded."
