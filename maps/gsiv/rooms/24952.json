    "Prickly shrubs camouflage a large hole in one side of a cramped, one-room jail cell with iron bars fitted across the windows.  Cater-cornered to some sturdy, wooden stocks, a rough-hewn oak platform supports a podium hung with a faded banner.  A well-traveled path leads away from the square and into a thick copse of trees at the bottom of a steep hillside."
