  "description": [
    "Entwined with slender vines and leafy tendrils, a half-obscured wooden totem stands just to the side of the broken path, its base surrounded by moss-coated cobblestones and a thick mass of creepers.  Although nearly invisible within the dim light and heavy growth, the totem appears to be of nearly human height and of the same thickness as a heavy lance.  Cracked and upturned, the cobblestones are more prevalent near the engraved symbol.",
