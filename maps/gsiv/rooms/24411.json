    "The trunk of the massive oak tree has been hollowed out to form this small office.  Dim light peeks through the knot holes in the trunk of the great oak, in addition to the light produced by candelabras on either side of the Guildmaster's desk.  Bear-skin tapestries and mounted animal heads adorn the dark wooden walls of solid oak."
