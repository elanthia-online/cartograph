    "A fine layer of white pottery dust covers every flat surface in this shop.  Tall vases filled with wilted yellow ferns flank the doorway in a failed attempt at elegance.  Lanterns cast their warm yellow light across the shelves of pottery and blown glass behind the counter.  A slight breeze blows through a window set high in the east wall, cooling the shop.",
    "A fine layer of white pottery dust covers every flat surface in this shop.  Tall vases filled with wilted yellow ferns flank the doorway in a failed attempt at elegance.  The only window is narrow and set high on the western wall, but sunlight shafting through still brightens the room slightly, and a light breeze drifting through eases the heat of the room.  Shelves filled with pottery and blown glass line the wall behind the sales counter."
