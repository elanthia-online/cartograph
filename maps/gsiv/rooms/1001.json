  "description": [
    "An overpowering odor of fresh meat mingled with a hint of decaying flesh fills this bend in the tunnel.  A dark red swinging door set into the northeast corner of the tunnel springs open every so often, and a dwarf pushing a cart loaded with a variety of cut meats hustles her way to the west.  When she returns, the cart is empty save for bits of flesh and a bloodstain or two.  A burnished steel sign affixed to the wall to the right of the door announces the ownership of the premises."
