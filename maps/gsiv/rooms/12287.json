    "Wide windows, paned with rainbow glaes, glitter softly as the daylight strikes them and create swirls of color upon the polished teak floors that spread outward in into the various directions of the shop.  Brightly painted signs hang upon the smooth white stucco wall opposite the entry, their flat surfaces describing the various areas of the shop.",
    "Wide windows, paned with rainbow glaes, ring the front of the shop and are lined with broad sills housing brightly burning candles that illuminate the polished teak floors.  Shadows flicker across the many signs that hang upon the wall opposite the entry, their painted surfaces describing the various areas of the shop."
