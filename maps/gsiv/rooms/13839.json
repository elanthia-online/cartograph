    "Beneath a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling, a trio-bladed mounted vellum fan hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls.  Some hammered copper display hooks and a Vornavian silk-covered table sit in opposite corners while a thin gold-edge black runner rests on a black-checked white tile floor."
