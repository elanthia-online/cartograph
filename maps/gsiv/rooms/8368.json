    "The passageway twists like an immense stone serpent, and as it curls back over itself, the cant grows steeper and less fraught with debris.  On the walls, the glyphs grow smaller and more intricate, the higher one climbs.  Fragments of whispers tug at the consciousness intermittently, as if the mountain itself is trying to communicate the dangers it embraces."
