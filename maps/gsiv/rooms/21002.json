  "description": [
    "Careening almost violently over the stones in its path, the river crashes downstream, falling off suddenly in the nearby distance, though it could merely be the dense foliage creating an illusion.  A dull roar fills the air, though the overwhelming sounds of rushing water and insects at work is much more distinct here.  Lofty and wispy, stringy ferns attached to tall trees drop down over the path, their mossy green overshadowed by darker ferns that lean over the path from further up above."
