  "description": [
    "The broad sweep of the sand floor is interrupted by an open-mouthed giant white clamshell.  Halfway to the seaglass ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the blue-speckled sea glass walls.  An aqua-hued seaglass display and a warped treasure chest are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
