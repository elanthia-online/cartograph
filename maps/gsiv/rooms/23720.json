    "Secreted away amidst towering cedars and firs, this quaint garden has a simple, wild charm.  Decorative hedges line a moss-lined cobbled walk as it winds its way towards a short flight of steps that lead up to a white clapboard house.  On either side of the walkway, a quartet of evenly spaced raised planting beds teem with wildflowers.  Cutting through the grid of abundant color, a faint footpath leads to a side yard."
