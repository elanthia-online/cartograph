    "The deck of the ship is rotting away in some places, but is oddly pristine in others. Doubling as a hat stand, the bow area contains a miniature foremast. The main deck houses a table for accessories and a trunk for footwear, and the quarterdeck utilizes the ship's wheel as a clothing rack. Replica deck hands are seen fighting an intimidating dragon eel on the starboard side. Leading to the captain's quarters is an ornate wooden door, and moving to the stern of the ship reveals the exit.",
