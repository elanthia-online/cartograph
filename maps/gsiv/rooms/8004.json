    "Dark and damp, this small cavern is silent save for the eternal sound of water, dripping and flowing, echoing dimly as it seeks the depths of these caverns.  Columns of rust-tinted limestone form a lifeless and grotesque forest that waits endlessly for the ages to pass, hoping for a Spring that never comes."
