    "Surrounded by a semicircle of multi-hued alabaster tiles, a small shrine rests beneath the protective boughs of an old black oak.  At the center of the shrine, mottled by the shadows of the overhanging branches, sits a solid block of silver-laced white marble, its top hewn to create a shallow bowl-like depression.  A mat of woven river reeds lies in front of the marble block.",
