  "description": [
    "Brass and glass display cases line the walls of the tidy room, their polished surfaces reflecting in the candlelight.  Bright blue walls provide a sharp contrast to the dark brown floor and ceiling, while standing candelabras hold court amongst stools in the corners.  A dark brown archway provides egress and allows fresh air to permeate the windowless space."
