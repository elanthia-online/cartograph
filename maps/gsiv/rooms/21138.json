  "description": [
    "Shadows and candlelight vie for dominance as they dance across the domed ceiling of the alcove, their silent battle making visibility tenuous at best.  Uneven cobblestones cause the lone table to wobble awkwardly upon the floor, though the chairs seem to have little difficulty.  Rounded stones line the wide entry providing an excellent view of the bar, while some white chalk scriblings on a nearby wall stands out in the dark."
