    "To the northwest the Locksmehr River splits as it rushes around a large island, most of the water diverting into the western channel with the remainder slowly making its way past you down the eastern channel.  Someone has cleared a trail to the northeast, moving away from the river and into the surrounding deciduous forest.  To the south the trail follows the bank of the eastern channel of the river."
