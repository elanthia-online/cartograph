  "description": [
    "Large deep green tapestries flutter softly along the walls, each of the simple cloth banners stitched with a design of a different healing herb.  Narrow channels filled with rich soil house a collection of small plants and flowers, each basking in the sunlight that streams through two large windows overhead.  A statue of a man with a gentle-mannered expression on his face stands to the southwest, behind a wooden altar crawling with vines."
