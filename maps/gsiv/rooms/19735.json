    "Stone benches surround a long oval table in the center of this room.  Torches burn brightly and illuminate the table for reading or study use.  Small vents near the floor allow the ocean air to circulate, taking the torch smoke out through several chimneys in the ceiling.  The walls are covered from floor to ceiling with shelves crammed full of scrolls.  Interestingly, the majority of the shelves appear to contain information on honing one's will, meditation, and combat prowess rather than healing."
