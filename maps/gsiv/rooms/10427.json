  "description": [
    "Gilded molding, brilliant with black-flecked gold, outlines the doorway and front windows of this elegant little shop.  Ebonwood walls polished to a magnificent sheen are inset with panels of striated white marble.  Faenor sconces shaped like scallop shells curve slightly outward, and flicker with a warm light, the fragrance of their gardenia-scented oil filling the air.  Wide marble stairs lead up to the second floor, gold wrought-vine railings on either side."
