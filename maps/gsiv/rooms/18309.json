    "Clusters of fireflies gather upon the low-laying fronds of moriche palms, twinkles of glowing light blinking in and out amongst the tall grass that impede passage between the palms and the vine-laden trees as they crowd for space in the jungle.  Shadows dance about the thick vegetation sprawling over the damp jungle floor, and the quiet of night is broken by the rustles of nocturnal creatures within the dense surroundings."
