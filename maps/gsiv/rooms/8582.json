    "The grassy field widens here, providing a cool spot to rest and a good point to ponder the keep and its mysteries.  Peering out over the moat through the steamy haze above, you can see the entrance and a half-lowered drawbridge.  Below in the moat, small eddies froth and gurgle.  A dilapidated catapult stands forlornly on a clear swath of ground, silent witness to past battles."
