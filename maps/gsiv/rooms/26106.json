    "[Sienna Wing Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A reddish maoral table dominates the setting, especially with its rather impressive handiwork displayed so elegantly.  A trio of thick wax candles are placed at the center, giving the immediate area a soft and intimate illumination.  Seat covers of sienna velvet stitched with gold threading cover each chair, leaving only the natural wood legs and arms visible."
