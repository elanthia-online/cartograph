  "description": [
    "Glass-fronted lanterns dangle from wrought iron rings anchored to the ceiling to provide uniform lighting throughout the vestibule.  Several hallways branch outward from this point, each decorated with either navy blue or cerulean rugs that help to cut down on the echoing of voices and footsteps off of the stone walls.  An etched bronze sign is tacked to the lower half of the northern wall, while above it the towering image of a large black kraken being skewered by a bowsprit is painted in brilliant detail."
