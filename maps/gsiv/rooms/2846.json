    "Snow covers the top of this large rock, and large footprints mark much of the surface. A small, fist-sized hole sits almost in the middle of the boulder, and snow and ice have been cleared away from it. The snow at the edge of the top of the boulder looks as if it has been flattened by the passage of many climbers."
