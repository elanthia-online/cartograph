    "The craftsmanship of skilled stonemasons is evident everywhere as the path winds its way upward.  Although the trail is steep at points, each step is carefully carved from the dense stone, and the occasional handhold affords the heavily burdened a measure of safety.  The view in either direction is restricted by the continually twining path, but a warm, sweetly scented breeze flows downward from the unseen summit."
