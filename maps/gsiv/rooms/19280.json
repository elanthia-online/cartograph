  "description": [
    "Pure alabaster lines spread out within the dark, mottled stone walls, where candelabras adorned with white candles highlight the spiderweb-like patterns.  A curtain of climbing vines spreads across the ceiling and, despite the underground setting, is dotted with tiny crimson and violet blossoms.  A plush rug of dark blue partially spreads over the fel and willow flooring.  In between a carved willow writer's desk and a stone pedestal holding a small basin, four-poster bed is lavished with soft blankets."
