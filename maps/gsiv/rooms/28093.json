    "Perched at the edge of a towering aspen glade, a blue and purple pavilion holds court in the snow-covered alpine grass.  Lilac alpine asters bloom amid the heavy iron support spikes that bind the structure's walls close to the ground, their pale heads nodding in the heat that permeates the canvas walls.  Moonlight illuminates the white bark of the surrounding trees, while glaesine globes bath the flame-hued leaves in prismatic hues."
