    "Dimly lit by a mere few candles placed throughout the room, the walls of this small chamber feature bas-relief panthers and other cats crouched and ready to pounce.  A pair of luminous emerald green eyes to the southeast belong to a statue of a man reclining in a comfortable chair, his shadowed form recessed in a small alcove.  A claw-footed altar of deep red marble is set below the man's gaze, which seems almost indifferent."
