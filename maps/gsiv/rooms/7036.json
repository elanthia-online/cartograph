  "description": [
    "Once elegant, but now ruined, stained glass windows show this was once a chapel.  A smooth slab of obsidian seems to suck up all the faint light that falls upon it, and gives back only darkness.  On the slab, in sharp contrast, sits a statue carved of glittering crystal that bends and twists the few glimmers of light left into a mockery of beauty.  The question remains as to just what has been worshipped in here of late and you like not the thoughts it stirs."
