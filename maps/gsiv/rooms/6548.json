    "The fog drifts quietly through the lower branches of these trees, the trunks covered with moss.  Scattered underneath the boughs are small mounds of dirt, signs of some sort of small creature digging.  Chittering comes from above, the scolding noise making it clear they are unhappy that their haven has been disturbed."
