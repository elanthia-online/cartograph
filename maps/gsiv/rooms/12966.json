    "A tumble of rough granite boulders forms a craggy cliff along the north face of the hill.  Deep shadows fill the crevices between boulders and outcroppings.  A worn track follows the curve of the hill to the southwest, spiraling steeply upward.  High above, the top of a round stone tower can just be glimpsed at the crest of the hill.",
    "A tumble of rough granite boulders forms a craggy cliff along the north face of the hill.  Sunlight dances across the exposed stone, sparking white off the flecks of mica imbedded in the mottled granite.  A worn track follows the curve of the hill to the southwest, spiraling steeply upward.  High above, the top of a round stone tower can just be glimpsed at the crest of the hill."
