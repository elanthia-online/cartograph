  "description": [
    "The canyon's slope is strewn with loose stones, making the climb extremely perilous.  Very little grows in this desolate area.  Only a few brown lichens cling to the underside of the rocks, perhaps nourished by dew in the few mornings when the air is slightly humid.  Above the canyon ends at a thin shelf, while below it spills out into a rather woeful-looking forest.  Neither direction looks particularly appealing, but either is preferable to this spot."
