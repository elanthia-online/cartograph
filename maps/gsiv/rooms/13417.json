  "description": [
    "A small hill ascends to the southwest, and growing atop it is a small dogwood tree -- its arcing branches swept with immaculate pale pink leaves that flutter like feathered wings with each passing breeze.  Dark violet windflowers sprout along the ground, their numerous petals glimmering with a faint velvety sheen.  Pale crimson leaves litter the ground, mere droplets of color upon a carpet of healthy green."
