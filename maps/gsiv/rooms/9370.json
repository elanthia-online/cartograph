    "A small fire burns here, illuminating the room.  The remains of a modest meal lie on a scarred table in one corner, and iron shackles have been bolted to the far wall.  A small shrine lies in one corner, strewn with candles and other tiny objects, but as a whole it pulses with restrained power."
