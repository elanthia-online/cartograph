    "Dust-covered tables and broken chairs litter the room, along with some overturned crates, discarded peanut shells, and bits of broken glass that crunch underfoot.  Displayed on a long mahogany bartop is a small collection of weapons.  A ripped canvas curtain is draped behind the bar, and muddy boot marks lead up to a rough-framed opening in the far wall."
