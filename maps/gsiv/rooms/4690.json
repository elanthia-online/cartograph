    "Ornamental trees rise like natural pillars towards a clear crystal dome and a picturesque starlit sky.  A lush grass pathway leads towards a rock-enclosed waterfall that soothes the airy chamber with its perpetual flowing melody.  Padded benches and cozy rattan chairs are arranged neatly around the lovely indoor garden, promoting quiet conversation and peaceful relaxation among guests.",
