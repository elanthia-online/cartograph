    "Gasping for breath, from the climb down and from knowing how shaky your perch is here, you pause to wonder that the whole platform has not crumbled into the sea lurking below your feet.  At high tide, this entire ledge would be several feet under water to judge from some of the more spectacular examples of barnacles, mussels and larger, less easily identifiable things growing here.  Many bulky cylindrical shapes, each topped with numerous thin tentacles, are clustered at the perimeter of the ledge."
