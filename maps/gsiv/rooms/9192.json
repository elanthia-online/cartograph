    "A delicate bridge constructed of rose-colored crystal spans the entire keep and leads to a garish tower of coral and shells.  Light glittering off the bridge's glassy surface reflects so brightly that it is difficult to look at for any length of time.  The bridge has been built with no visible seams or flaws and appears crafted from a single gemstone of gigantic proportion.",
