    "One of the four table legs has been utterly destroyed in some past bar fight.  As a replacement for the missing leg, three mismatched pieces of linden wood have been attached to the table with rusted nails.  The makeshift table leg is shorter than the original three and is resting on a square piece of maoral wood, making the table tilt alarmingly.  As a centerpiece, a single wilted daisy droops over one side of a broken mug, which now serves as a vase and has water seeping slowly from its jagged crack."
