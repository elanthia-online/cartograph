    "Hugging the edge of a tiny cove, the dock follows the narrow jetty that protects the inlet's waters from maritime traffic and the native aquatic life.  Several whitewashed pedal boats bob up and down with the rhythmic pulsing of the tide from where they are anchored to pillions along the edge of the wooden protrusion.  Meandering through the moonlight-dappled verdant foliage along the northern edge, a slender shell-lined walkway provides access to the distant villa."
