    "The tunnel crooks sharply around an outcrop of stone, its diameter narrowing considerably due to the 'teeth' of rock jutting out from the wall.  Fog creeps around the obstacle, threading back and forth through the protrusions like surf crashing against a rocky shore.  The odor of decay is especially pungent within the cramped turn, where crevices and cracks in the walls could conceal menace or the by-product of mortality."
