  "description": [
    "A sturdy carved oak sideboard, laden with selections from the bounty of the sea, lines one wall of the spacious galley.  Beside it, a long table with some cushioned bench seating offers guests a relaxing spot to partake of the delectable morsels.  Along the far wall, a massive cast iron stove keeps the area toasty warm despite the gusting sea winds outside.  Mounted securely to the teak wallboards beside the stove is a tall whitewashed cupboard with twisted silver eel handles."
