    "[Stryos Home, Smithy]"

  "description": [
    "The ground floor of the smithy is one large room with an open back wall.  Hammers and tongs hang from the walls while chisels and other tools lay arranged neatly on wooden benches around the room.  Four grinding wheels of differing coarseness, two sturdy anvils, and three quenching barrels are spread around the stone floor.  Braziers in each corner of the room glow brightly, casting shadows around the room.  A cobblestone path leads back to the front of the house."
