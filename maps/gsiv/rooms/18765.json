    "Canted ceilings of green-tinged glaesine sheets rise high overhead, held in place with verdigris copper mullions, and a few intrepid vines wind across the outer panes, having clambered up from the cloister columns below.  Luminous moonlight drifts through the vines and ceiling, highlighting a pale acantha green limestone floor with blue-washed linen carpets.  An apple wood staircase curves downward, and an array of shadowy viridian ferns clusters along the walls, almost obscuring a narrow door.",
