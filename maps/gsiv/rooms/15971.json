  "description": [
    "The trail makes a lazy circle around a cluster of houses tucked on the edge of the bluff.  Pines give them shelter from the wind and the mountains give them timeless grandeur on which to gaze.  Next to the trail, a pine log has been carved in the shape of a bear, its paw lifted in welcome."
