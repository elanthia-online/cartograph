    "Bordered in travertine, cobalt, and pink soapstone, several tiered garden beds rise from the pathway's bright red cobblestones towards the garden's high walls.  Red sunflowers nod their dark heads from the upper tiers, while a bed of autumn-hued verbena holds the middle ground.  Coral-hued coneflowers give way to the ruffled spikes of canna buds upon the lowest basin."
