    "Nestled behind the pond, this covered gazebo offers a quiet retreat while still providing a grand view of the back yard.  Two wicker chairs and a loveseat rest inside the gazebo, letting guests find a natural setting to enjoy some solitude or have a friendly chat.  Copper lanterns hang from the shingled roof, their light swaying gently through the climbing roses and lattice, casting a soft amber glow across the pond while the soothing scent of lavender and the croaking chorus of toads rise from the surroundings."
