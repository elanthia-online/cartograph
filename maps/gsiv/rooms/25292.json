    "Glass sconces descend from the ceiling on silver chains, casting light upon a polished grey marble floor.  Centered upon it, a flawless alabaster basin stands surrounded by a multitude of bookshelves crafted from varnished kakore.  Tomes, vials, and supplies cover every shelf, but the room is immaculate despite the clutter.  A carmine velvet stool is tucked behind a large writing desk made of the same russet wood, and a small disheveled pallet of firecat furs rests against the wall."
