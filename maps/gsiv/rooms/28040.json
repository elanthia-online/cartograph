  "description": [
    "Shields and swords of every shape and size -- some wood, though the majority of metal -- are situated around the interior of the partially tented blacksmith's stall, the majority of the work noticeably inferior in quality.  A light breeze trickles in from the front, though the heat wafting in from the collection of furnaces behind the stall, which is somewhat obscured by a virtual wall of forging tools that drip down in hanging formation from several lengths of rope, is nearly unbearable."
