    "Shielded lanterns dangle from exposed rafters by slender bronze chains and provide ample illumination for the windowless office.  Floor to ceiling bookcases hug the circular walls and house hundreds of books, scrolls, maps, and tomes, which are arranged in tidy order and kept dust-free.  A single desk is ringed by sturdy oak chairs and are arranged to face the foyer to the west."
