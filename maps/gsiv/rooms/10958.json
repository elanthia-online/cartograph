    "Fresh cooked meats and herbs beckon you to have a seat at one of the many tables here and enjoy some of the towns finest meals.  A servant passes you with a smile as she continues to a nearby table to deliver a feast for some of the hungry customers.  From a door to the south you hear an occasional rattle of pots and pans."
