    "A rough trail winds down a rocky slope from the bridge above, passing through a stand of willows.  The trees' lacy fronds move slowly at the prompting of a light breeze off the river.  They stand together, growing more dense the closer one gets to the bank.  The path meanders between the trunks, running at an angle from the swift current of the water with its constant susurrus and sparkling reflections of sunlight.",
