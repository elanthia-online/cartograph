  "description": [
    "Tangled and twisted vines ensnare local shrubbery in a cultivated method that forms an organic wall around a small mud and twig village.  Looming conifers shroud a dirt road framed in high blue-green monkey grass in deep shadows, their entwined limbs and thick foliage blocking most of the sunlight from filtering through.  A deep silence settles over the area, only occasionally broken by the sound of guttural squabbling."
