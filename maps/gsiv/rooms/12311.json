    "Bright streams of sunlight make their way into the entry through a white-shuttered front window, casting dancing shadows across the bleached driftwood floor.  Sets of framed images line the bamboo walls, hand-drawn charcoal scenes from around the Four Winds Isle.  Below the skylight-set ceiling, abalone-trimmed shelves have been built along the tops of the walls, each arranged with tropical floral baskets and seaside mementos from the island.",
