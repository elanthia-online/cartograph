    "Trees fall away as the trail wanders along the edge of a large meadow.  Tall grasses sway in a light breeze as wildflowers of all colors spring up in a vibrant display.  The throaty voices of frogs can be heard as bats flit and dart through the air.  In the distance, the silhouetted outline of mountains can be seen.",

The low hum of bees can be heard as swallows flit and dart through the air.  In the hazy distance, snowcapped mountain peaks can be seen."
