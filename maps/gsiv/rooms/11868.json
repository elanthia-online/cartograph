    "The tunnel ends at a sheer granite wall.  A sparse amount of green light filters in from the south to barely illuminate the walls and floor in this dead-end.  Apparently whoever dug the tunnel decided there was no need to go any further.  The answer, perhaps, is on the floor.  Water bubbles up liberally through several large cracks that cross the floor from wall to wall.  The water fills the area to about a foot high or so, and then flows off to the south."
