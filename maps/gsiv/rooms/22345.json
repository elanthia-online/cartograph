    "Small homes line either side of the tiled street, the cabins simple in construction, but appearing to be comfortable enough for a small family.  A few squirrels skitter across the rooftops, their tiny claws clattering on the wooden shingles.  With the exception of the nervous animals scurrying about, the neighborhood is silent."
