  "description": [
    "Panels of silk are arranged in layers around a central support ring to form a peaked roof that is swirled with color.  Each panel branches off into one of five directions in a solid color of either green, blue, yellow, violet, or crimson and forms fabric-swaddled tunnels that lead further into the shop.  A circular velveteen settee is set at the center of the room beneath frosted, mutihued glass globes that are suspended from twisted wrought iron poles."
