  "description": [
    "A wide walkway encircles the fighting pit.  Carved into the stone walls are seats for spectators to view the contests of bravery and honor below.  The stones of the walkway are worn smooth from years of stomping as the observers cheer for their favorite combatant.  The only decoration on the chamber's circular wall is a finely made tapestry."
