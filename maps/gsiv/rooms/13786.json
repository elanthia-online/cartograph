    "A snarling war griffin painting hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling rises overhead.  A woven Vornavian silk rug sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is an intricately carved ebonwood stand on one side of the shop and a dovetailed oak table on the other."
