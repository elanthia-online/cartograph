  "description": [
    "This walk, crossing the battlements protecting the gate, gives a shielded vista of the castle yard.  It also offers an exceptional view of the surrounding countryside outside the castle environs.  The cold waters of Lough Ne'halin encompass the fortress's feet like a steel-gray carpet.  To the west, a dark forest approaches the lake's edge and stretches inviolately to the horizon.  On the wall's east end, narrow stairs lead down into the castle buildings."
