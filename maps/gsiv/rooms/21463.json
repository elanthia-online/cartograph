    "A thick oak pole in the center of the pavilion, adorned with a series of hooks, supports the silken canopy overhead.  A large fel table runs the length of the northern wall, while a rough maoral rack stands at the eastern wall.   Along the southern wall rests a varnished beech display, with a polished oak stand by the western wall."
