    "Several colorful booths and tents are scattered throughout the empty fields, which lie in the center of the otherwise verdant growth of artichokes.  At one corner of the area, particularly bright displays of purple flowers pop out of several artichoke plants.  The scents of the flowers, which are mutedly aromatic, drift through the night air.",
