    "An outside fruit bar consisting of a long wooden counter and some tall wooden chairs is partially covered by a bright yellow and blue canopy.  Behind the counter sit dozens of baskets of fresh picked apples, peaches, mangos, and bananas.  Small lanterns hang from braided rope attached to the tall trees that surround the stand, giving a bright glow to the evening darkness."
