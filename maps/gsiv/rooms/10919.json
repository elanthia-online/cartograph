    "The crowded bazaar assaults with sensation: heat, exotic smells, the din of voices raised in peddlers' hawk.  Facades of buildings around its perimeter catch the clamor and send it back on itself.   In every direction, the surrounding skyline is a jumble of soaring minarets and buildings crowded together so closely, one could stroll easily from roof to roof.  Interspersed are the tops of tall lebbek trees, their thin foliage jutting up over the architecture like jaunty plumes in a patchwork hat."
