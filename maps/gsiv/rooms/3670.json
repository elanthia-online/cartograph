    "Exotic potted palms line the walls, their fronds gracefully reaching out creating a canopy of leaves that tickle the ceiling.  Between the trunks of the palms, a hint of the rich mahogany wall peaks out.  Handwoven imported grass rugs cover the wood floors.  Patrons come and go irregularly, a small group occasionally stopping to mill about in quiet discussion before continuing on through an intricately carved maoral arch that leads farther into the bank."
