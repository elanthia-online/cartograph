    "Plush velvet carpeting spreads from the top of the staircase throughout this cozy sitting room.  A long settee upholstered in pale ivory silk sits near the small curtained window with a sleek ebonwood case resting on its wide sill.  A massive ebonwood bookcase built into the far wall frames a small marble fireplace, and the cheerfully crackling fire within casts a warm flickering light over the contents of a velvet-lined basket set out on a small accessory table nearby."
