    "The canopy over the four-poster bed hangs in tatters.  A shutter bangs noisily against a window, the glass cracked and broken.  The wardrobe stands open, its contents relatively undisturbed, though showing the ravages of time.  A large dresser has been ransacked, each drawer opened and its contents hanging out.  A portrait over the fireplace has been slashed, though the picture is still discernible."
