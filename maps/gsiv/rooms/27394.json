    "A great expanse of glacial rock and ice rises up, the naturally domed structure braced in curved, polished pine beams designed to embrace the frozen stalactites pitching down in crystalline brilliance.  Thin paper lanterns float from glaes-linked suspensions, glowing with pale lilac and blue hues of the phosphorescent orbs nestled within."
