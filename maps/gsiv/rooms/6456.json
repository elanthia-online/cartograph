  "description": [
    "Tall columns of limestone surge upward from floor to ceiling, mingling there with splendid formations of multicolored stalactites that drape like a magical canopy over this enchanting forest.  At the very highest point of the expansive ceiling, a large cluster of crystals have formed, and each flicker of light passing through the natural prisms splits into thin beams that dance across the cavern."
