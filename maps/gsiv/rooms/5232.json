    "Dozens of barrels, some still intact, litter the larder, which once held the food supplies of the crew.  Most of the barrels are stained with soot, and some have burst from within to spill their rotten contents on the deck.  Some of the whole barrels bear the names of nearby port cities, including Kharam Dzu and Vornavis."
