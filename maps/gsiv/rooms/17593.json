    "Separated from the main dock by a pair of steps, the pier is slightly lower and stretches out into the waters of the harbor.  Mushroom-headed moorings line both sides of the platform, which is constructed of oil-treated oak, while blown glass globes are strung in a straight line from the tall pilings."
