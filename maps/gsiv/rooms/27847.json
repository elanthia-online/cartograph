  "description": [
    "An expansive dome looms above the space, the curved ceiling reflecting the Winter Constellations marked by glowing green glimaerstones and thin veins of glowing lichen.  Makiri and Tilaok are set in close orbit around Liabo, whose bright glow provides ample lighting for the room below.  A smaller, yet quite substantial Lornon looms darkly in the stone sky above.  A reclining padded circular bench sits in the center of the room allowing visitors to gaze up at the dome above."
