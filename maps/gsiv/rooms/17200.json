    "The paintings hanging on the wall are not paintings of the ordinary type.  They seem to portray a series of visions, each one containing creatures and beings not known to Elanthia.  They are hauntingly beautiful, and somewhat disturbing, but they seem to hold a message that cries to be heard."
