    "The wide ribbon of barley plants finally reaches a dead-end in the middle of the spiral.",
    "The wide ribbon of barley plants finally reaches a dead-end in the middle of the spiral.  The farmer displays a slight bit of design sense here.  The rows do not just end, though.  Instead the inside rows connect to each other.  Then the next row on each side makes a curve to connect.  This occurs again and again until finally the outside rows arc around and join, giving the end of the ribbon a symmetrical, rounded appearance."
