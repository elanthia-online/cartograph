    "An enormous stone hearth dominates an entire wall, where a roaring fire burns within, warming the entire area.  Above the hearth's mantle are ancient and battered shields, each one decorated in the symbols of every dwarven clan.  Tables and chairs are set up around the front room while uniformed barmaids meander about, refilling drinks or cleaning up empty plates."
