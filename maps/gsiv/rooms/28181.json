  "description": [
    "Flowering brushes and various greenery surround the giant oak trees that enclose the clearing.  Some carved wooden benches are arranged about the area, their surfaces carved with a variety of woodland creatures.  Bright ribbons crisscross back and forth from tree to tree, creating a canopy in bright hues.  Colorful crystal lanterns hang from the silken ceiling, throwing vibrant shades across the glade."
