    "Freshly painted white walls surround this stark room.  A strangely designed lantern at the center of the ceiling washes the room in a bright and remarkably steady light.  No dirt or other debris can be spotted anywhere.  A workbench, a sales table and a display stand have been crammed into one corner of the room, somewhat haphazardly."
