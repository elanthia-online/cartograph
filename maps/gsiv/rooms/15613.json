    "Darkness envelops the long, winding hallway, only a few sputtering candles casting their dark crimson light into the clinging shadows.  The vague outlines of many paintings interspersed between the ornate ivory doors can be glimpsed in the gloom, their edges traced with delicate silver filigree.  Long velvet curtains tinted a deep shade of carmine compliment the matching velvet rug lining the floor, their golden tassels tied tightly to block any view of the outside world."
