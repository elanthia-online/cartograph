  "description": [
    "Rising several handspans from the smooth floor, a cinnabar and travertine railing encircles the balcony that is exposed to the open air.  Stretching upon the horizon is a sprawling city, while nearer at hand and far below is the bright crimson Garden of the Planes.  An illuminated teleportation disk recessed into the ground flashes with a steady pulse and fills the air with a gentle humming sound."
