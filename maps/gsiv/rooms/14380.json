  "description": [
    "A series of two-dozen cast-iron bells, in sizes ranging from halfling height to giant height, fill this steeple chamber, leaving little room for walking.  Metal rods, pushing up through fitted openings in the floor, are attached to these bells.  The ceiling tapers up toward the tower's uppermost spire point, its interior painted a glossy black and embellished in silver-leaf with images of the stars of the Elanthian constellations, the mariner's directional guide since first he ventured out upon the seas."
