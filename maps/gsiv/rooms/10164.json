    "A slight bend in the gully here has allowed the trickling stream to gather into a small pool before it continues over a small dam of rocks and a rotting tree trunk.  Verdant moss has overwhelmed the surface of the fallen oak, and a small hole near the wide end nurtures the growth of several fiddlehead ferns."
