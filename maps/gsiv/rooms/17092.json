    "Under the table, a rough wood box holds a mother cat and her three kittens safely out of the way of the patrons.  To accomodate the box, the chairs have been pushed a bit farther back from the table than usual.  Nearly invisible among the usual jumble of chicken bones and bread crusts on the floor is a bowl of milk."
