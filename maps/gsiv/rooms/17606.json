    "Sunlight peaks through the verdant leaves of the hibiscus plants that have been coaxed into growing along the overhead trellis that shields the white and cobalt blue tiled patio.  Natural-hued wicker chairs and couches are arranged in small social circles around tables topped with glass and sport decorative cushion in a variety of colors.  A stove is positioned upon soapstone supports in one corner, while the other houses a fountain that feeds into a large turquoise basin.",
