    "Piles of broken bones lie stacked around the scratched and lichen-stained walls of the deep pit, their random arrangement suggesting that the osseous collection was thrown in piecemeal from above -- perhaps rejected by the designers of the bone-adorned chamber overhead.  The deep scratches on the dirt walls hint at some unknown inhabitants' long-ago efforts to escape, though a crude rope ladder now leads up to the dimly-lit barrow chambers."
