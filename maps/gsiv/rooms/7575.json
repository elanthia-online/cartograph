    "The tunnel slopes up to the north and southwest here.  Trickles of muddy water collect at your feet and run off into a large hole at the base of the wall.  The clicking noise that fills the tunnel, as well as the acrid scent that assaults your nostrils, seems to emanate from the dark hole, which is large enough for even a giantman to squeeze through."
