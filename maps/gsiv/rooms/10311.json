    "Candles blaze in sixteen brass holders to brightly light the room.  The greens, yellows and golds of harvest predominate in the carpet, walls and ceiling, and the use of wicker lends a rustic feeling to the setting.  A large bed occupies much of the south wall, and wide wicker chairs rest in the northwest and northeast corners.  A window box containing numerous potted herbs extends from the west wall, and the box's glass panes allow the sunlight to flow in and nourish the plants.",
