    "Mounted on the wall, greeting all that walk this corridor, is the gruesome sight of a stuffed Agresh troll warrior head.  Steel grey paint runs down the warrior's face in equal strips, and its mouth is frozen in a rictus snarl.  The shaggy hair of the beast moves ever so slightly on a current of air from an open window, while its glass eyes appear to track your every move."
