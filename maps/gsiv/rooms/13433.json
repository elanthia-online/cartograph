    "Rich golden brocade covers the walls, its ivy and rose pattern drawing the eye upward to where an elaborate mural, depicting scenes from various points in Solhaven's history, covers the ceiling.  The red velvet carpet continues its journey from the steps straight towards a graceful archway, its length lined by small limestone columns, each clearly intended to hold a small statue or bust, but all currently still empty."
