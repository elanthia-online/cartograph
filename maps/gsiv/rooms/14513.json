    "In the distance, beyond the trail, a mammoth nest can be seen, built in the crux of two flat stones that are braced to lean against each other.  A pair of adult griffins fly back and forth to the spot, attending to the structure itself and occasionally disappearing within.",
    "Two layers of metal fencing separate the trail from the edge of a steep cliff.  Extremely tall, thin posts topped with glowing glass orbs are strategically placed along the barrier, each radiating a nearly translucent web-work of faint red lines."
