    "Through a gap in the black curtains lining the walls, you catch a glimpse of the polished basalt that encloses the Spider Temple and spy a corner of a small window slit.  Though the plain, shabby furniture in the room is covered with a fine filigree of dust and spider webs, you have the eerie feeling that this part of the temple is far from abandoned."
