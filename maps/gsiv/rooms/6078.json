    "Weeds insinuate themselves among the wheat stalks, digging in and taking over wherever they can find an opening.  The height of the wheat discourages or kills many of the low-growing types of weeds, but the taller weeds grow as fast or faster than the wheat, shooting up to drink in the available light.  These weeds will be cut down with the wheat, separated at the threshing floor, and burned or discarded."
