    "Somewhere overhead, the ceiling of the cavern lies out of sight, shrouded in darkness.  Some of the varieties of lichen and fungi that fill the underground landscape glow with pale unearthly light that provides dim, shadowy illumination.  Molds and mosses growing on the stone spires take the place of leaves and bark that you might see in a forest of trees.  Instead of mottled browns and variegated greens, everything here is a dull, washed-out grey with only a hint of color here and there."
