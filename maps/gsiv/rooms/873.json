  "description": [
    "After a strenuous climb, the rocky shelf levels off high on the mountainside.  The opposite wall of the canyon falls away, following the incline of the mountain to the north, opening up a breathtaking vista.  A series of snowcapped peaks are visible in the distance, standing silent vigil in the frigid winds of the DragonSpine."
