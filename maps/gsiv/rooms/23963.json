    "Just visible above the overgrowth of the river road are the remains of a small river port, a mixture of skeletal stones and intact structures.  Jutting only a few feet into the river adjacent to the port are the remnants of an old stone dock, now silt-covered and the perching place of dark green moss.  Just beyond the port and commanding a view of the surrounding terrain is a prominent mound."
