    "A massive circular table fills the room with some large padded chairs next to it.  Hanging from the domed ceiling above is a golden chandelier, illuminating the room.  The walls of the room are painted with a mural depicting Icemule at night, with hundreds of small candles near each burrow.  Sequestered beneath a carved marble arch is a steep stairwell, leading back to the foyer."
