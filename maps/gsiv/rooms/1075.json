    "The wind howls across the high plateau in chill, dry gusts, trying desperately to suck the moisture out of everything it touches.  The plateau's surface is dustless, scoured clean by the wind's relentless journey and left to gleam with a grey dullness in the moonlight.  The interior's cracks rush toward the plateau's edge, only to close before reaching their goal, leaving the edge passable to both the northwest and southeast.",
