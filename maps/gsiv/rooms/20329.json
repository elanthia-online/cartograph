    "An eerie quiet pervades the swamp.  Not even a hint of a rustle of life comes from beneath the poision ivy vines and shoreline brush or the overhead branches.  In the water, bald cypress trees form a loose semi-circle around the shore, the water within completely still.  Splinters of moonlight from above streak down on the black water to illuminate the single, ghost-like water lily that floats on the otherwise shadowy, unreflective surface.",
