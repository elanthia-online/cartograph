    "A large chateau stands beneath the branches of an ancient oak, enjoying the shade of its expansive boughs.  Children run pell-mell around the structure, dodging dogs and geese.  A number of doors leading into chambers within the stronghold claim small gardens fronting them, full of roses and day-lilies."
