    "Here the olive trees are younger and smaller than those in the rest of the grove.  Growing only about 20 feet in height, they appear to have been deliberately planted in roughly straight rows.  The moons illuminate a wooden sign set firmly into the ground by the nearest olive tree.  A few pastel-colored stucco buildings line the pathway.",

The trees have been carefully tended and pruned.  A wooden sign is firmly set into the ground by the nearest olive tree.  A few pastel-colored stucco buildings line the pathway."
