    "Crates and a few volumes are piled up in the back of the room, most of them holding a thin layer of dust.  Tall oak bookshelves line the paneled walls, their shelves bowing under the weight of the stuffed manuscripts and parchment that overflows its space.  Despite the flickering of a nearby candle-filled globe, the quintessence of silence fills the air of the library at night.",

A few robed figures move about the back of the room, carefully marking on pieces of parchment they carry as they categorize inventory."
