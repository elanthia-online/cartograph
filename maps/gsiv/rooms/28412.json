    "Despite the best efforts of the pair of pierced iron braziers limning the entrance of this narrow alcove, shadows cling to the ironwood bookshelves tucked into its back corners.  A brass-hinged footlocker, its padlock still closed but attached to a battered and dangling lockplate, stands opened and resting on its side near a small puddle of indeterminate origin."
