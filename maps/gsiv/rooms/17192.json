    "A small black marble building is set against the walls of the courtyard, its diminutive form shaded by a large willow tree overhead.  The willow's vines sway slowly every few moments, obscuring the dark walls of the building as stray winds pass by.  A pair of golden doors lead into the small structure, their surfaces engraved with a detailed rendition of keys.  The very air seems to muffle all sounds, imparting a strange pervasive silence to the area."
