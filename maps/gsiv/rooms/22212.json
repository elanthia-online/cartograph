    "Sword aloft, a hulking Vaalor elf is remembered in statue at the end of the low-ceiling chamber.  Runners of golden and crimson velvet soften the tiled floors below, the hues reflecting in the burnished marble of the ceiling.  A lustrous mosaic-tiled arch gleams from the southern wall at the hallway's midpoint.  Near the corridor's end, the simple entrance to the armory and a swinging oak door heading into the kitchens stand opposite one another."
