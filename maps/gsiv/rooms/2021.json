    "Several thin saplings quiver in the shadows, thrilling to some breeze too faint for any but their papery leaves, and their whisper creeps between the roots of their ancestors.  There are no words to this mysterious language, only hope and promise.  From the north, the sound of running water echoes in reply.",
