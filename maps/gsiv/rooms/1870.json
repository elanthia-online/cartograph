    "Clanging bells, steam whistles and hoarse dwarven shouts crowd the air of this busy port.  Squat ferryboats wallow in from a gaping hole in the mountain just to the south.  They are piled high with lumps of raw ore and pick-bearing dwarves.  A large building to the northwest belches forth great clouds of black soot, and everything here has a layer of grime."
