    "A long line of tall tall birch trees stands slightly into the grasslands just behind the stone wall.  Planted closely together, the narrow, leafy trees slow down the air currents, turning them from brisk winds into gentle breezes that merely caress the tops of the stalks.  The line of trees marches west and east, and the trees are positioned well to filter the prevailing winds that sweep down from the north.  All the birches are upright, straight, and appear to be in excellent health."
