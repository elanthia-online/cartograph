    "Grossly misshapen crabs scramble along the rocks of this shoreline, scattering at even the slightest disturbance.  Moving far too fast to catch, the shelled critters have numerous cracks and crevices to hide in.  A jagged purple growth of coral seems to be the favored spot to hide for the speedy crustaceans."
