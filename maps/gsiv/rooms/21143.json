  "description": [
    "Opposite the set of double doors leading in, the stage stretches from one end of the room to the other, beyond the proscenium arch with its dividing burgundy curtain.  Facing the stage, row upon row of opulent rowan benches, covered in soft burgundy velvet cushions, stand upon the black marble floor.  Torches around the room serve to light the space, and can be snuffed or lit as needed.  The proscenium steps on either side of the stage are each flanked by a small oak door leading out of the room."
