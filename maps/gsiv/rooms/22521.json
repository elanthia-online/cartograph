    "The walls of the room are painted a soft red and are illuminated by the soft glow of some ornate gold sconces evenly spaced along the walls.  At the front of the room is a long etched glass jewelry case that guards several female mannequins locked in alluring poses.  There is a slender emerald green arch with a wall-mounted statue of a beckoning female hand next to it."
