    "Windowless lanterns frame the open gate, their vacant skeletons eerily dark and silent.  Destroyed barricades lay in scattered, scorched chaos about the area as if taunting would-be defenders with their uselessness.  Glinting in the moonlight are the half-buried shards of rainbow glaes panes."
