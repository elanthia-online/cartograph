  "description": [
    "Flat marble walkways lead northeast and southeast to the inn's rooms.  A towering marble fountain dominates the courtyard's center, and its cascading waters change their flow patterns regularly to create different appearances and effects.  Six tables surround the fountain, keeping a safe distance from the fountain's watery spray, and freestanding torches occupy places near each table to await the coming night.  An immaculately dressed lady supplies food and drink from behind a polished brass bar."
