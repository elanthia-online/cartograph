  "description": [
    "Ornate balustrades define the hall's central aisle toward the east but end in the center of the room, where a double-arc of columns faces the dais that rests atop a semicircle of golden steps near the chamber's west wall.  Each column has been carved into a stylized species of demon that both supports the high ceiling and stands as a mute witness to whatever transpires at the stone altar atop the dais."
