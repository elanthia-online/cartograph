    "Flowering vines tenaciously climb their way across the bordering white cliff face, digging tiny green tendrils into each crevice and crack to gain a secure hold.  Rounded petals of sunburst orange and brilliant red bloom along the length of each vine.  The ocean far below throws angry waves crashing against the shoreline, erupting into a frothy spray before subsiding once again."
