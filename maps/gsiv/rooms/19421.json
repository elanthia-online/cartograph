    "Ceiling-high shelves crammed full of books, parchments and scrolls fill this small library.  Interestingly, the majority of the writings address the honing of one's will, meditation, martial arts and weaponry rather than healing arts.  The shelves press so closely together that there is no space to sit down.  Rather, upright lecturns allow places for standing reading.  Two large iron pipes gurgle and hiss as they heat the room, and several bright oil lanterns hang from the ceiling rafters."
