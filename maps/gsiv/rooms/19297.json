    "On the flat roof of the Great Room is a garden, ingeniously crafted to resemble a natural meadow.  A light breeze ripples the long grass, causing moon shadows to flicker across their rippling surface.  Higher stories of the hall border the southern edge of the expanse, and a row of bungalows can be seen lining the eastern section.  Bright lights shining from the buildings' windows cast shadows behind a trio of malachite benches holding court in the surrounding sea of grass.",
    "On the flat roof of the Great Room is a garden, ingeniously crafted to resemble a natural meadow.  A light breeze ripples the long grass, intermittently hiding patches of wild flowers.  Higher stories of the hall border the southern edge of the expanse, and a row of bungalows can be seen lining the eastern section.  A curling ribbon of fragrant smoke lifts from the roof of the west wing, wafting past a trio of malachite benches holding court in the surrounding sea of grass."
