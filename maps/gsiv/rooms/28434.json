  "description": [
    "Black stone gives way to earthen walls as the surroundings shift from structured dwelling to natural grotto.  Near the edge of a large crystal-clear pool, a stone outcrop rises slightly above the water's surface.  A notice board hangs behind an old and pitted anvil in a darkened curve of the cavern.  A gentle moan is caused as air enters the shop via a stone-lined opening and through a yawning hole in the wall."
