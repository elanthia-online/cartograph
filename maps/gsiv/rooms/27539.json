  "description": [
    "Perpetual and pervasive, the roaring sound of the ocean striking stone is thunderously loud as it tumbles over the shale walls and heralds an ambient breeze that plucks at the tattered fabric of tapestries draped from high rafters.  Wrought iron cages bind fitful torches in place, the constantly moving flames creating dancing shadows throughout the dank space.  Antiquated chairs surround a trivial firepit burrowed deep into the gravel and sand-covered floor, while a warped and waterlogged cupboard occupies a small space on the eastern wall."
