    "Footprints lead up the side of a snowy hill, ending a short distance away.  A string of snow angels sits at the top of the trail, having frozen into semi-permanent shapes in the smooth white surface.  Above the makeshift artwork, a thick shelf of snow partially shields the area from being covered up by inclement weather."
