    "Light and airy, this half-circle room has been converted into a small shrine.  Woven meditation mats are spread across the hardwood floor, offering a place for restful repose.  The curved, pale green painted wall sports an open window and thin, sheer ocean blue curtains that flutter in the occasional breeze.  A low oak and seashell altar stands beneath the window, opposite from both a rounded oak arch that leads to the next room and a narrow set of stairs that heads up through an opening in the ceiling."
