    "This room is spherical in shape, save for the smooth black floor underfoot.  The walls, floor and ceiling are composed of obsidian, and the effect is not unlike being trapped inside a giant black bubble.  Standing in the center of the room is an enormous obsidian stone, flat and thick at the top and spreading wider to its base, which appears to have melted and fused into the floor.  A staircase, cut into the stone at the perimeter of the room, spirals out of sight below you."
