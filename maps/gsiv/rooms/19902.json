  "description": [
    "Gilded mesh encloses a piece of the night sky, and you are lulled by soporific birdsong.  Owls continue their low-pitched inquiry of the nightingales who sing amidst the branches of the potted trees, but the raucous parrots and fenvaoks are asleep.  The moons seem nearer and worldly matters much more distant from this eyrie."
