    "An immense, seamless slab of polished black, silver-flecked granite forms the primary horizontal work surface for this utilitarian room.  An elderly elven seamstress, spectacles perched upon the bridge of her nose, works on the hem of a red-checkered sundress for the naked ragdoll beside her.  On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the seamstress is actually a life-sized doll, and that her sewing needle has not moved."
