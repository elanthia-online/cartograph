  "description": [
    "A squat structure built from thick ironwood stands just ahead, its double doors open.  Warm, moist air wafts out to freeze solidly on the trees in this courtyard.  Ivory bars gleaned from mammoth tusks are placed in between the ironwood beams and siding, breaking up the monotony of dull brown wood with polished white rectangles.  To the left of the squat structure a four-story tower rises, and a chimney extends thirty feet up from the tower's roof, belching steam that freezes to fall as gentle snow."
