    "A towering gate stands outside of the castle, while a gold-embroidered crimson rug leads deeper inside.  Perfectly spaced apart on the walls, a row of golden candelabras burn with heatless ethereal flame, casting a bluish white radiance across the entry.  Placed onto a marble podium in the center of the annex, a picture of a family clad with ornate royal jewelry and clothing proudly sits between a greatsword and embossed shield."
