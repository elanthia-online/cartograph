    "Ominous creaks from the cedar planks below are heard with every footfall.  The black water below is eerily still, without so much as a ripple disturbing its obsidian-like smoothness.  The walkway continues westward, but a broken handrail and bootprints on a hillock just beneath show where less prudent souls have stepped off to venture through the southern swamp."
