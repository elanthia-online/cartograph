    "A rough angled ceiling of thin ironwood plates arcs overhead, supported by thick poles of ironwood that continue down to the ground that is far below.  Planks of wood make up the sturdy albeit rough floor, and a few small notches are cut into the dark walls.  The countryside expands out beneath you, its terrain easily visible from this high vantage point despite the icicles growing here and there."
