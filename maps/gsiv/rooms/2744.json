  "description": [
    "A desolate blanket of snow stretches out endlessly, interrupted only by an enormous mountain far to the northeast.  Swirling winds quickly cover any irregularities on the lifeless plains. The snowdrifts lapse to allow passage to the north and west, and an opening in the ice to the south offers some protection from the elements."
