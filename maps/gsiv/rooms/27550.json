    "Cramped and musty, this space is cluttered and disorganized; scraps of leather lie in disarray on the floor amongst various bones.  A yellowed skull lantern with several missing teeth sits on a bone-braced wooden shelf, the flickering light from its eyesockets casting dim illumination across the room.  A rickety bone bench is set up against one wall, the surface surprisingly clear of debris.  The humid air is filled with the periodic rattle of the bone walls as the wind shakes the structure.",
