    "You are on a broad limestone cliff between a towering wall of sheer rock and the deep river ravine.  The distant howl of wind and surf echoes dimly from outside.  It reverberates and booms until it sounds like the wailing of the damned.  The cliff curves around the wall to the southwest.  A crevice in the wall opens a passageway heading northwest.  The natural stone bridge provides a convenient way to cross the river.",
