  "description": [
    "Numerous rolls of bright fabrics on racks take up most of the space in this small shop.  The remaining area is taken up by sundries, rolls of trim, and drawers filled with small accessories.  Pins, needles, and buttons are carefully sorted into small racks, as are spools of thread and skeins of yarn.  A tiny desk almost hides the diminutive halfling shopkeeper from view."
