    "The glaesine windows of a nearby cottage are thrown open, and voices rich with laughter float out upon the breeze.  Workers pull and push carts bearing cargo towards the airship docks.",
    "The windows of a nearby shop are thrown open to catch a breeze.  Next door, a stone warehouse has been converted into multiple family dwellings, each home demarcated by its individual door.  One door is sapphire, another lapis, a third azure and a fourth a peeling dark blue."
