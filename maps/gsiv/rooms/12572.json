    "The branch extends through the canopy like a moon-dappled thoroughfare, edged with a complex pattern of vines inset with orchids on either side.  Beams of moonlight penetrate the foliage here and there, dappling the fig tree's smooth bark.  Around the branch's sides, the forest floor is lost in darkness.",
    "The branch extends through the canopy like a shaded thoroughfare, edged with a complex pattern of vines inset with vividly-colored orchids on either side.  Rays of sunlight penetrate the foliage here and there, dappling the fig tree's smooth bark.  Around the branch's sides, the forest floor can be glimpsed far below, overgrown with mounds of bromeliads and forest cucumbers."
