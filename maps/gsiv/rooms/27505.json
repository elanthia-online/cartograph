    "Dark shadows stretch the length of this dusty hut, with half-rotted planks nailed haphazardly across the walls.  The entire structure appears to have been built with little care and great haste.  Along the back wall, an oversized black oak chest sits open and appears to have been stuffed haphazardly with various articles of clothing.  The faint outline of a trapdoor can just be made out in the dust piled in the back corner of the room."
