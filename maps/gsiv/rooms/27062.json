    "A decorative linden branch wreath hangs on one of the painted emerald green walls, and a cerulean cloud-painted ceiling rises overhead.  A sphere-topped black marble fountain sits in one corner of a buffed cherrywood floor.  There is a large oak table on one side of the shop and a painted red cedar rack on the other."
