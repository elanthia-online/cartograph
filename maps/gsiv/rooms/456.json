    "Three large modwir trees stand in a north-south line and split the trail as it passes from west to east.  The northeast branch runs up the side of a long winding ridge while the southeast branch disappears in the brush that grows along the base of the ridge.  The two trails come together and form a wider trail that runs off to the northwest."
