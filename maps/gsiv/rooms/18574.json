    "Tall and short mannequins are arranged in descending order along the back wall of the shop, and are kept just far enough away from the open window to prevent fading from the moonlight that trickles in.  In one corner of the shop a mirror has been set within a tripod so that guests may view themselves, while the other holds a black iron display rack filled with bonnets, hats, and shawls.",
