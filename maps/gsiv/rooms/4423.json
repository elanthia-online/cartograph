    "A golden glow from glass lanterns fills this small, natural cave.  Earth-toned wool rugs cover the dirt floor in order to keep dust to a minimum.  The shop is neat and tidy, with all the displayed wares having received a recent polishing to make them shine.  A curtained narrow passage can be seen to the rear of the cave."
