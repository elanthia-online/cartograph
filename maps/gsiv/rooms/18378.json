    "Bordered to the northeast by trimmed rose bushes is a meadow littered with red, yellow, and the occasional blue-petaled flowers.  Long stalks of gold-green grass reflect the sunlight, evoking an image of a rippling golden pond.  The meadow runs up against the green-veined riverstone wall that extends around the monastery.  A path cut into the tall meadow grass runs along the wall up to a narrow riverstone arch."
