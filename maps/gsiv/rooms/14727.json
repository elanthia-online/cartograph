    "A raised platform of stone with a steaming hole of simmering water in its center blocks off further progress to the south.  Standing in a semicircle beyond the mound is a grove of stark, pointed pikes, the remnants of trees now petrified by a rain of silica erupting from the depths of the cavity over countless years.  Underfoot, deep rumbles can occasionally be heard, the restless growls of underground water pressure threatening to emerge like a dragon from its den."
