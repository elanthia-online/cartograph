  "description": [
    "In the midst of this small clearing stands a long table topped with six evenly matched troll king skulls.  A fist-sized hole has been bored into the top of each skull, and the skulls appear to be lined with some sort of slimy bladder.  The spongy ground squishes with each footfall, an unpleasant boggy scent oozing to the surface through the mud."
