    "Colorful bursts of wildflowers sprout up alongside the dirt path as it slowly curves west through the meadow.  Occasionally a small herd of spotted deer stop here to graze, lazily nibbling at grass.  Behind them is a watchful buck, his stunning antlers held high as the sunlight glints off his shiny russet coat.",
