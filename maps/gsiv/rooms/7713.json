    "Weblike trails of what appears to be long-dried seaweed hang from the craggy walls and ceiling, swaying gently in the chill breeze that permeates the curving tunnel.  A few scattered bits of metal lie half-imbedded in the floor, including a discarded and now rusted breastplate sealed to a narrow ledge by ages of mineral deposits."
