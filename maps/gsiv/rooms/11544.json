    "The bluff overlooks Maelstrom Bay.  The sky over the bay is dotted with grey gulls, hovering and diving for fish.  Razor grass, impenetrably thick, is mixed with the taller beach grasses that line the landward side of the path.  To the north the terrain climbs up to a steep headland.  Southward the path slopes gently down."
