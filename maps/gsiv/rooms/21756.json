  "description": [
    "Tendrils of a strange scent assault your nose as you peer around a dimly lit stone chamber.  Fading embers from a fireplace are the only illumination and a cloud of incense forms arabesques above a brazier nearby.  Coarse granite shapes the walls and ceiling and darkly polished marble flooring reflects the feeble light.  A huge grey wolf stands poised near the door and a canopied bed looms near the fireplace.  Odd weapons and strange bits of armor lie scattered about the room."
