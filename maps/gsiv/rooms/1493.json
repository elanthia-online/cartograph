    "Several fair-sized dwellings along the lane's north side have been stained in dark greys and browns, doubtless influenced by the nearness of the Lornon temples visible beyond them to the northeast.  The houses along the south side of the street, however, appear just as substantial, but have been whitewashed to preserve them against the salt sea air and are shingled and shuttered in reds and blues."
