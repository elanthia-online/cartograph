    "Walls covered in warm brown panels rise from the coral orange tiles that spread across the floor and are only interrupted by wide windows that are framed in cerulean gauze drapes.  Standing opposite the entry is a roped-off arch, which has a set of stairs leading up.  Twin counters stand in the center of the shop and flank a workbench, where various bows are being crafted."
