    "Black tallow candles on scrollwork iron sconces flank the entry, casting a tainted light across the interior of the wagon.  The matte dark purple walls, painted with glossy thin ebon stripes, reach from the black carpeted floor to the matching ceiling that arches overhead.  Small ebonwood shelves line the walls, their surfaces strewn with oddities and knick knacks.  An iron scrollwork table and chairs sits near the eastward passage, laden with refreshments to beckon shoppers further inside."
