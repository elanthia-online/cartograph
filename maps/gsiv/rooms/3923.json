  "description": [
    "A thick layer of dust covers rocks laying in heaps against the sloping tunnel walls to either side of a narrow trail.  At places, rat tracks are visible in the dust, as well as other, much larger prints with a canine configuration.  Dust hangs heavily in the air, lifted by occasional drafts of wind breathing down the tunnel.  It stirs the gritty curtain into a roiling cloud that slowly enshrouds any evidence of life with its relentless grey mantle."
