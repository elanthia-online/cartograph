    "A spacious, semicircular room curves to the west, north and east.  A steel gate interrupts the long, flat southern wall, allowing exit to Zul Logoth proper.  Openings line the curved granite walls, most of them darkened and giving no indication of their reason for existence.  Several heavy timbers anchored to the smooth granite floor support a web of ceiling timbers, which, in turn, support the wide granite ceiling."
