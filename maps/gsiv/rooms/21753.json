    "This simple monastic cell is sparsely furnished.  A small bed with plain linen sheets, a single thin pillow, a rough wool blanket.  An unvarnished oak table is flanked by a pair of spindle-backed chairs.  A tall bookcase, filled with scholarly tomes and scrolls, is the only extravagance in the room."
