    "Scampering quickly across the meadow, a sleek cinnamon-colored rabbit rushes towards a thicket.  Several small boulders, perfectly sized to sit on and relax on a sunny afternoon, are scattered about the meadow.  The soothing sound of creek water rushing over a bed of pebbles wafts through the air."
