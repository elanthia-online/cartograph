  "description": [
    "Light from flickering candles drives back the long shadows in this room.  Thick hunter green curtains rustle against partially open bay windows, billowing in a light breeze.  The walls are adorned with large bookcases containing all manner of foreign tomes and official township documents.  Beside the canopied bed are several comfortable reading chairs and a mahogany credenza with a map engraved on its surface."
