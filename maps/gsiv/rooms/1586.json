    "A sawmill stands north of the road, the muted buzz of a mechanically-driven saw forming a constant backdrop to the periodical clatter of freshly-sawn planks being handled and stacked.  Through the workyard gate, the open interior of the mill can be seen by the light of well-placed lanterns, an old, dun mule plodding in an endless circle around the center pole and driving the large wooden gears that turn on the floors above.",
