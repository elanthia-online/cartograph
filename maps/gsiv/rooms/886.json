    "A swift breeze blows through the pass, its movement accompanied by a shrill, high-pitched whistling.  Besides the chill caress of mountain air, the breeze carries the fresh scent of pine.  Gazing upward, a few tall pine trees can be seen growing along the uppermost ridge of the pass, their slender shapes blocking out thin slivers of the night sky.",
