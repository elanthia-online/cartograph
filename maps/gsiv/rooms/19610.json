    "White gossamer drapes flutter lazily in the light seaside breeze that drifts through the open birch windows that they frame and is accompanied by the spill of golden sunlight.  A full-length mirror stands beside a glass-covered wrought iron table that is covered with roses in nearly every hue of the rainbow and still has ample room for storage.  Standing at opposite sides of the room, a series of silvery ash stairs leads down into the ebon chapel, while a marble ivy-patterned staircase leads into the white chapel.",
