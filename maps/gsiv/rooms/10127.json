    "Murky water surrounds a collection of cypress trees, the broad roots sinking deep into the mud.  Buttonbush speckles the tufted sedge that borders the faint pathway forking around a small pond.  Elven moss and poison ivy lines the cypress knees sitting nearby, overshadowing the trail with their silhouettes in the dim sunlight.",
