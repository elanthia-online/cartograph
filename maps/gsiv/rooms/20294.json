    "Gold-washed walls sparkle from a spiraling floral glitter design, and ropes of faux jewels create sparkling curtains that cover the windows inside the wagon.  Two mannequins pose as if in the middle of an animated conversation.  At their center, a grandiose bouquet features ostentatious silk flowers, shimmering ribbons and an oppressively perfumed odor.  A stool and chain-link collar lay tucked in the back corner."
