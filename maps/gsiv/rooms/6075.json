    "A deep culvert runs northeast and southwest, marking the southeast border of the wheat fields.  A small amount of water trickles toward the southwest, carrying a bit of silt downstream with it.  Rocks line the culvert's sides, but these appear to be more stones that have been unearthed by the passing water rather than those purposely brought to shore up the embankments.  The farmland road runs along the other side."
