    "Most of the permanent residents of the village live here on a less-traveled section of the ledge.  A threadbare tent is tied down with crude metal spikes hammered into the solid rock.  The wind ruffles the cloth of the tent with every gust.  A patch of dirt covers the ledge's surface, some blades of long grass have taken hold in the small amount of soil."
