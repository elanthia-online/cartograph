    "The interior of the pale green wagon is haphazardly decorated with swathes of multicolored fabric to cover the otherwise bare walls.  A set of rickety old oak racks stand in the middle of the room holding a selection of wares.  In the corner of the room a makeshift fire pit has been built, a pile of applewood logs crackling within it.  The ceiling has been festooned with holly, giving the wagon a festive ambiance.  A large oak-framed sign leans against one of the walls."
