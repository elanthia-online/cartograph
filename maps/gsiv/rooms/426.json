    "The modwirs grow thick here on the south side of the hill, their scent so strong you can almost taste it.  Rustles and crackles echo from the underbrush around you.  It looks like part of the hill has collapsed, taking a trail with it.  There's a narrow path running parallel to the old trail, but it looks treacherous."
