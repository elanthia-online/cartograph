    "The stone walls are crowded with wooden bookshelves, their lacquered heights brushing the low, carved ceiling.  In the middle of the chamber sits a wooden table, unremarkable save for its top surface, which is a raised and plastered topographical map.  Similar maps, though of different areas, are piled in a corner of the room, underneath the tripod base of a brass alidade and compass."
