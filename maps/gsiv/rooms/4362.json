  "description": [
    "This earthen corner of the mine extends far into the distance, the back wall obscured by hazy smoke that hovers over the busy dwarves crowded around pot-topped cooking stoves.  Despite the close confines of the area, customers have packed themselves in, exchanging silvers with the clerk for warm food and a mug of tantalizing cider.  A few intrepid souls remain in the corner to consume their purchases, but most escape as soon as they can to the relatively cooler freedom of the passage."
