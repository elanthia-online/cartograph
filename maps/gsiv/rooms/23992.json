    "A quartz-inlaid white marble bench sits amidst a thick stand of haon that crowds thickly alongside the path, permitting little sunlight to permeate the shadows of the forest.  Tiarella and purple-edged violettas blanket the forest floor, surrounding a white marble statue with pillows of silvery pale color.  A row of tiny glaesine globes have been strung from a branch, each globe holding an unlit white candle, and gently sway over clusters of yellow daffodils."
