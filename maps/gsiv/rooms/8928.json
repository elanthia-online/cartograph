  "description": [
    "The auditorium is large enough to seat hundreds and is clearly the heart of the guild.  A mosaic of sea life surrounds the circular chamber and the light cast by girandoles containing white candles, give the undine creatures the illusion of motion.  Benches are arranged concentrically about a high dais with a lectern draped in vivid blue silk."
