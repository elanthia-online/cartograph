  "description": [
    "Blue and red arrows painted upon the smooth planks of the dock point to the northeast, while a solid green arrow points to the southeast.  A pair of sturdy steps leads down to a finger pier with five docking slips, a small sign next to them proclaiming \"Slips 1-5,\" while heavy rope woven through holes in the support posts creates a flimsy railing.  Unseen in the dark sky, circling gulls lend their squabbling voice to the air."
