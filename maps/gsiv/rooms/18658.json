    "Twelve small statues, each tinted a different shade, sit in niches in the walls.  They look out over the room, some glaring and some kind, examining each supplicant who has come to pray.  A round rug in a deep shade of aqua covers the floor, providing a bit of warmth and protection from the cold."
