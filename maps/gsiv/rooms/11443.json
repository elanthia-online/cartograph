    "The green, foam-flecked waters of Maelstrom Bay stretch out in all directions.  A powerful, swirling current prevents any movement north and west.  To the southwest, a low coral reef rises above the wide, rolling swells.  The white spray from the swells slapping against the reef appears ghostly in the moonlight.",
