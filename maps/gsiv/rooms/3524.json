    "The rich smell of chocolate drifts from the nearby shop.  The stone-clad building, its windows thrown open to the breeze, is carved about the door and window embrasures with flighty impressions of faeries and other fanciful creatures.  A hand-lettered maoral sign hangs on the shop's door.",
    "The faint scent of chocolate is barely detectible beneath the overwhelming stench of burned wood and scorched stone.  What was formerly a small shop is now merely a stone husk, all traces of its wooden door, windows, and framework completely obliterated by lightning and fire.",
    "An enticing mixture of fragrances wafts from the small, stone-clad rations shop -- the spicy scent of jerky, the rich smell of chocolate, and the aroma of freshly baked bread.  Along the side of the cottage, a small garden has been planted with an assortment of herbs and vegetables.  A hand-lettered maoral sign hangs on the shop's door."
