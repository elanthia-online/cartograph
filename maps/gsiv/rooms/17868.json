    "The corner of a playing card peeks out from underneath the edge of the runner carpet, one of the few signs of untidiness to be found in the meticulously kept building.  Serving girls pass by occasionally with trays of drinks in their hands, though none appear to be in much of a hurry and they often take a moment to smile slightly as they stroll along."
