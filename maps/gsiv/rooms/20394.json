  "description": [
    "A veritable forest of mistwood support poles fills this area, each outfitted with a descending spiral of pegs upon which wares are displayed.  Winding through the pathway between the shafts are overlapping runners in silver and blue silk, neatly covering the ground.  A silver-trimmed wood trunk is shoved up against one silken wall, overflowing with chemises, petticoats, and other feminine underpinnings."
