    "Wide windows fitted into the smooth teak walls of the building provide an excellent view of the pier and docks that jut out into the harbor.  Neatly bisecting the room, a long wooden counter separates a young elven clerk from the open floor of the shop.  Standing opposite the entry, a tall arch leads to the property's private boats."
