    "A dark gloom greets the end of the great stone stairwell as it comes to a stop at broad landing.  Pierced only by the light of a single flickering torch, the gloom gives way to a hallway leading to the east, the same direction from which flows a damp breeze thick with the smell of decay.  Footprints cover the surrounding floor in a haphazard pattern of chaotic activity, many possessing clawed toes and heels."
