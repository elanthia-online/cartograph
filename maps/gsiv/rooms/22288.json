    "To the west, the great Citadel of Barret's Gorge rises up like a giant black obelisk, its walls lined with soldiers and archers between parapets.  To the far south, the foreboding Demonwall stretches as far as the eye can see.  Down below, citizens move about their business, many keeping to themselves."
