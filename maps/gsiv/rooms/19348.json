    "Lining the sidewalks, the windows of the glass lanterns that dangle from wrought iron shepherd's crooks glitter in the sunlight.  Enormous terra cotta urns set at the base of each pole are filled with star-shaped lavender clematis, their wide, dark green vines twining about the slender crooks.  Standing out amid the verdant lawns and sprawling villas that line the cobblestone street is a palm-thatched bamboo shop that has an elegant painted sign dangling over its front door.",
