    "Bright light filters in from the north, its steady glow clearly illuminating the cobblestones of the floor, ceiling, and walls, while also casting the southern end in shadows.  Not a stitch of debris, dust, dirt, or cobwebs litters the floors or clogs the corners and the scent of fresh water mixes heavily with lavender in this section of the passage."
