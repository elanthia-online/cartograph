    "Patches of phosphorescent red fungus grow along ceiling of this circular tunnel, the invasive confines of the room tinted a melancholy sanguine by the growth.  Vertical fissures spread across the walls like jagged crackles of energy.  A light coating of moisture edges the deep scars upon the earth, the tiny drops imparting a sparkling sheen to the otherwise dismal surroundings."
