    "Armed with a large butcher knife, a priest meticulously spreads what appears to be cockroach marmalade on a thick slice of bread.  Completing the task, he picks up the piece of bread and flings it across the room against the far wall!  The bread sticks to the wall for a moment before sliding down to the floor to join the slumped forms of its predecessors, where a sizable crowd of live cockroaches appear to be helping themselves to the gratuitous feast."
