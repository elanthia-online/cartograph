    "A small stream cuts through a grove of pine and low dogwood trees.  Cottages squat in the copse with a thick, aromatic carpet of needles scattered around their foundation.  The melody of the brook is echoed by the soft sound of waves from the lake's edge.  Large stepping stones offer a natural bridge on which to cross the water."
