    "The sides of the immense hall reach upward to a vaulted ceiling.  The smooth, natural surface of the wood is broken by veins of dark, twisting structures that run along the inside of the walls.  The lighting is surreal and shifts with each passing moment, coming in odd colors and intensities, seemingly from the walls themselves.  Two looming corridors gape to the northwest and northeast."
