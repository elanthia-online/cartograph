    "Jutting out at odd angles from the edges of the tent's flaps, verdant green grass seeks the sunlight beyond and struggles to free itself from the muddy ground.  Hardened clumps of mud form lighter patches in the ground near a small brazier placed between the tent's chambers, though it does little to warm the air beyond its small domain.  A rough wooden plank rests upon several crates displaying wares, while a small brazier fitful burns and struggles to eat the dark confines.",
