    "A peculiar clearing has formed in the forest here.  A large depression in the ground is totally devoid of trees or shrubs.  In the center of the depression is a dark hole, leading down into the earth.  The trees are far too thick to penetrate into the forest in any direction from here.  A narrow path, however, leads away from the clearing into the woods."
