    "Lanterns sway slowly in the ocean breeze, dotting the length of the walkway in intervals to provide illumination for the boats tied to the posts.  Moonlight glistens off of the wooden planks slick with ocean spray, the pallid shafts of light sparkling upon the mirror-like surface of the ocean stretching out endlessly to the south."
