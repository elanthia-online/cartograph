  "description": [
    "Lit by a single candle that rests atop each of several tables, the room is dim and wreathed in a thin veil of smoke that obscures the darkened corners.  A plush forest green rug covers the hardwood floor and muffles the sounds of footfalls.  Scattered atop the rug are a few black velvet settees, each one paired with a carved cherry oak end table.  The only break in the dark, matte gold paint of the walls is a rounded black oak archway that affords a glimpse of the tavern."
