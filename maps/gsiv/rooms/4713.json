    "The taller members of the coniferous forest back away from the road slightly, allowing younger specimens to take root near the cobblestones.  The treetops sway in a soft breeze that gently filters down to brush the lower tree branches and bring a welcome coolness to the area.  A well-trodden path winds through the ferns, disappearing in the undergrowth to the northwest.  It appears to be somewhat more than simply a game trail."
