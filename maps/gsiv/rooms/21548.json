    "The cleared dirt track leads behind the wagon, where a flaking gold-painted ladder leads up to the wagon's rooftop storage area.  Tall, dark, and spindly, branches from a brittle dead tree extend out toward the wagon and have been used as a makeshift display stand through the help of numerous hanging wooden boxes."
