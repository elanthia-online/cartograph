    "This room is stuffed floor to ceiling with a variety of trunks, chests, and other packages, all sealed and neatly but indecipherably marked.  In the center of the room, two short stacks are topped with some deringo boxes and some rowan crates, all of which are open.  Towards the back of the room, the tall stacks are neatly wrapped in linen."
