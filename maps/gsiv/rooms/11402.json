    "Marking the northern boundary of the complex are the rooflines of the armory and the garrison to the north and the infirmary to the northwest.  Beyond the buildings and the surrounding walls of the Citadel is empty wilderness, stretching off toward the horizon, interrupted only by the occasional tall tree or open meadow."
