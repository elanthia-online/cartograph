    "Harsh winds howl through the narrow pass, their hollow moans dissipating in the chill night air.  Scattered stones and jagged bits of rock clutter the passage, making movement through the cleft both hazardous and slow.  In some places, the mountainous walls have deteriorated, dropping sharp stone slivers and fist-sized rocks to the ground below.",
