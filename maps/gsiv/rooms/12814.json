    "Glancing around the interior of the room reveals several sturdy looking armor stands.  Various types of armor, from leather to plate, rest atop the stands for display.  Polished shields have been hung from the walls and seem to stand guard over the room.  Somewhere nearby the distinct sound of a hammer striking an anvil can be heard."
