  "description": [
    "A single large pillar candle rests upon the glossy surface of a small black ora altar, its flame dimly illuminating the stark contours of a looming, stylized figure carved from the granite of the surrounding walls.  One arm of the statue is extended, its finger crooked as if beckoning toward the darkness beyond.  The shadows shift and waver as the meager candlelight flickers, revealing a small book lying open upon the altar."
