    "Overhead, the roof is composed of dark oak beams broken by arcs of glass that intersect in the center of the ceiling to form a starburst pattern.  Directly beneath the heart of the star, a perfectly proportioned black lacquered workbench, equipped with a gold gem lens assembly, an unglazed blue pottery crucible, and an etched glass alembic, stands atop four tapered legs."
