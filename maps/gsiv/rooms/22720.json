    "Moss-covered rocks rise into a high cluster upon the eastern edge of the pathway and are surrounded by thorn-riddled bushes that are devoid of leaves.  Ominous shadows trail across the spongy, softness of the landscape where enormous muddy bubbles rise and burst as underground gases escape from the bosom of the earth.  In tandem to the popping sounds of the mud, the wind whistles through the rocks and carries with it a fetid stench."
