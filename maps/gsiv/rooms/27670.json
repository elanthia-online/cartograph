    "Nervous energy lingers in the small space, belied by cluttered vanity mirrors and disheveled costume racks shoved off to the edges of the room.  A stone chimney stretches proudly up the back wall through the darkened timbers of the ceiling, though the slightly smoky quality in the air suggests a less-than-perfect draw, even for the timid fire presently burning.  An elaborate painting of a halfling with caked-on makeup in a tutu has pride of place over the mantel."
