    "Polished black marble peeks out from beneath the edges of a richly appointed ivory velvet carpet which stretches down the expanse of the hall.  Resting against one wall is a giant clam from the depths of the ocean with bits of a shredded locker manifest cradled in its polished, pink interior.  A single window at the far end of the hall lets in sunlight and an ever-present, albeit faint, hint of an ocean breeze and salty air.",
