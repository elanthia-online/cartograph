    "The makeshift road is little more than thick, well-traveled mud, rife with the deep grooves of wagon wheels and the slopped prints left by passing boot or shoe.  A wooden fence follows the road to the south, turning sharply from the west to the northeast.  Trees bare of leaf or fruit are scattered sparsely between the few houses and barns that occasionally dot the street to the north."
