  "description": [
    "The road opens to allow the traffic to veer off down avenues leading in a number of directions.  It is shady, sheltered by the overhang of houses crammed into every available square foot of ground not taken by the thoroughfares.  A strong odor of coffee emerges from an awning stretched over a niche in a wall.  Beneath its striped canopy, a man brews the beverage over a small fire flickering in a large brazier.  Sacks of coffee beans are stacked around him like pillows."
