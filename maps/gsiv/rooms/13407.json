  "description": [
    "Dark green vines creep along the wrought-iron fence that encloses the garden, pale white blossoms speckled among their verdant surfaces.  Small saplings grow amidst the surrounding foliage, their miniature boughs swept with lighter hued streaks.  Soft blue cobblestones are arranged in neat columns underfoot, each shadowed by the variety of long-leaved shrubberies and other flora cultivated along the edges of the gate."
