    "Nestled between two smaller cottages is a quaint gabled house.  Intricate scrollwork trims the house, the swirls and waves stained in various rich hues.  Ranging in hues from greens and blues to purples and greys, the tiles of the roof show recent signs of repair.  Sunlight slants across the landing where the entry stands beneath a sign that hangs from a wrought iron bracket.",
