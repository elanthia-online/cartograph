    "This small chamber to the side of the entryway continues the column and beam architectural flourishes from the main cavern.  A long white modwir rack and a short shield stand are the only intentional decoration in the otherwise sparse chamber.  Veins of gemstones spiral across the floor in random patterns, occasionally interspersed with sparkles of shining metal."
