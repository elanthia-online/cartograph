    "Across the low greystone wall to the north, the city stretches for a great distance until it ends in the vast expanse of BriarStone Keep.  A round bell tower, its dark lapis-tiled spire topped with a silver and sapphire pennant, marks the city limit.  The air is filled with the delightful scent of roses that grow in large bushes planted along the north wall of the inn.  Two benches covered with overstuffed eelskin cushions provide a wonderful spot from which to enjoy the pleasant aroma and view.",

A round bell tower, its dark spire topped with a fluttering pennant, marks the city limit.  The cool, night air is filled with the delightful scent of roses that grow in large bushes planted along the north wall of the inn.  Two benches covered with overstuffed eelskin cushions provide a wonderful spot from which to enjoy the pleasant aroma and moonlit view."
