    "The round tunnel makes a sharp turn here, the texture of the moist walls a mottled collection of rolling bumps.  Rich streaks of dark red and ochre flow across the earth of the passageway, the color bleeding together in languid waves.  The perpetual sameness of the area is unbroken save for small pieces of debris spread about the floor."
