  "description": [
    "Thick oak beams are nailed together to form a wide platform suspended from the trunks of massive trees.  The planks are cut to split around a particularly wide one and both sections wind further into the shadowy forest.  A sturdy rope bridge leads over a rushing waterfall towards an aqueduct, while a single oak plank leads away from the main platform and comes to rest on the edge of a hollowed out opening in a nearby tree."
