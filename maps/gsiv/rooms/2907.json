  "description": [
    "The corridor widens into a chamber that is bare except for an object in its center, a sarcophagus made entirely of ice.  The panels forming its walls are cloudy and striated with swirls and variegations.  Although the chamber is austere, designs cover walls and ceiling on every side, a veritable riot of color and form all possessing a striking sense of movement and vitality.  The playfulness of the renderings lends the somber form in the cold, icebound bed a sense of joyful transfiguration."
