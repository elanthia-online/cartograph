    "Salt-stained, thickly woven cotton carpets the ground with the image of the stork of Torre -- now a very bedraggled, tired-looking stork indeed.  A heavy chest to one side and a solid-looking shelf on the other pin the makeshift floor covering in place, though sections of torn fringe on every edge still wait to trip up the unwary foot.  Directly opposite the exit, a mildewed wooden sign with prominently painted lettering hangs from a nail on the wall."
