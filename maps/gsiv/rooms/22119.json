    "Crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling, their positioning perfectly illuminates a trio of flowery tables set about the room.  Blue and green braided throw rugs decorate the polished linden floors, their patterns swirling about creating a fanciful pattern.  Framed by a pair of blooming rose bushes, a swinging door leads out of the dining area."
