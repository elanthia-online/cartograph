    "Swathes of opalescent satin drape from the tent supports to form the walls enclosing this small area, and the trio of silver-shaded lamps dangling overhead provide ample lighting.  Along the back of the tent is a long frosted glaes counter with a thin-limbed crystal tree and a mirrored square dish resting atop it.  Nearby, a three-tiered glass display table sits beneath a silver square-framed mirror securely bracketed to a pair of support poles."
