    "Off to the southeast, a large peachbasket sits atop a tall staff, the pole topped with a flying Jolly Roger.  The landmark of the Crow's Nest Pub telling only part of the story of the rough and tumble origins of many of the burrow's inhabitants.  Drunken citizens totter towards their homes, mumbling to themselves in a crude attempt at singing."
