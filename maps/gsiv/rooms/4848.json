    "Beneath the shade of tall oak trees, several hazel trees flourish.  Smaller than the oaks, and shade loving, the hazel trees are more like tall shrubs than trees.  Clusters of unripe nuts are clearly visible among the leaves.  The distant sound of running water can be heard over the rustle of leaves."
