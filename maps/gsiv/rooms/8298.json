    "The sameness of the huts that surround you on all sides here, at the center of this broad clearing, is depressing and forbidding.  All their entrances face towards the west, where the gates of the large, black temple loom in the distance.  One hut lies closest to you, just beside the path, and appears to merit further investigation."
