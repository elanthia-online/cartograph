  "description": [
    "The wooden beams above sag with the soggy burden of age and abandon.  At the center of a room, a ship's wheel hints at the boat's former grandeur with its copper-covered handles; the once lustrous metal is now dulled by a grimy patina.  Dirt-covered windows provide only a hazy view of the outside, and damp cushions provide an awkward seating arrangement on the wood floor.  A rickety oval door leads back to the party boat."
