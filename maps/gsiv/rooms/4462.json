    "Randomly placed candles offer a dim, yet functional, source of light to this dark cave.  The flickering candlelight illuminates patches of lichen on the walls.  A mithril weapons rack has been haphazardly attached to one of the cave walls.  Two boxes, a large wooden strongbox and a heavy steel chest, have been left open to display the wares inside.  Flanking the weapons rack are two glass display cases."
