    "Tall grass sways gently in the breezes passing over the field.  Here and there, the precise furrows made by plows are broken up by more recent signs of digging.  The earthen hills of moles and gophers mingle with shoveled trenches made by the noses of wild creatures searching for burrowing insects and tasty roots."
