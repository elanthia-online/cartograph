  "description": [
    "The leafy tops of young trees peek out from under the thick ivory-hued railings that edge the balcony, and the view of the small pond below and the accompanying shrine is only enhanced by the subtle crimson oil lamps hung around the area.  The silhouette of the guardrails forms intertwined loops and arcs, converging into a single downwards-turned dagger that points to the very heart of the garden below.  Faint trickles of wind lightly caress the area every few moments."
