    "A single rusting gauntlet lies against a battlement, its fingers curled around a simple black iron chain attached to the stone floor for no apparent purpose.  The end of the chain ends abruptly in a broken metal link.  A series of hills and a deep vale are visible to the east surrounded by wilderness."
