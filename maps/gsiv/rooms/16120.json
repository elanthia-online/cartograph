    "This small room is decorated by a large bed, which has been pushed into the far corner of the room.  A fluffy down mattress sits atop the frame and has a number of folded blankets and pillows on top of it.  Across from the bed is a large, overstuffed chair with a fluffy vibrant pillow crushed into its seat.  Thick curtains drawn across a the room's single window shut out the chill and dark of the night.",
    "A large bed, overhung with a voluminous shroud of mosquito netting, rests in the farthest corner of the room.  A brassbound sea chest stands at the foot of the bed.  A single arched window allows a bright sliver of sunlight to enter the room.  Directly beneath the window is a overstuffed chair."
