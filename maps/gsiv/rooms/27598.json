    "Pale greys and soft whites adorn the workshop in decorative counterpoint to the showroom.  The paneled walls and floors are made of whitewashed ash glossed to a high shine, reflecting the light from evenly spaced brass sconces.  A small worktable with neatly arranged tools has been covered with a clean linen cloth."
