    "Entry through an ebonwood arch muffles unwelcome noises of the street.  Directly opposite, a shallow pool reveals water darkened by the black slate slabs of its inner construction.  Rising east and west out of the pool, two enormous metal sea serpents sinuously twist and intertwine in a never-ending dance for superiority.  Smoothly polished flagstones provide even footing around the open court, while tall hedges of hemlock, cut at uniquely sharp and opposing angles, lend an air of privacy."
