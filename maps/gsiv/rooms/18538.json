    "The moons above shed pale light on the path, and a slight breeze stirs the air from time to time, making a cool spring evening even cooler.  From their hiding places in the thick grass, tiny flowers shiver with each breath of wind.",
    "The sun in the sky overhead is bright and makes the air warm, with a slight breeze keeping it from being uncomfortably so.  Flowering weeds flourish at the path's edge, tiny blossoms of violet, white, and pink peeking from amid the thick, green grass."
