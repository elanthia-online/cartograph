    "Despite being large and spacious, this room's temperature is stifling, and bits of ash and dust skitter across the floor and float in the air.  A steel pot hanging from a cast iron tripod is suspended over a gash in the floor, a rush of burning air continuously gusting from it, keeping the metal pot heated.  Sealed containers of cooking supplies are scattered about the area, and a series of crudely made shelves containing food hangs from the wall."
