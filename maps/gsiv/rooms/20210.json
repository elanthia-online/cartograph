    "A large clearing beside the path is marked with signs deterring visitors from venturing too closely.  Heavy iron stakes protrude from the ground, each attached to an equally heavy chain.  The circles of packed earth surrounding each iron anchor pin show the pacing range of the animals normally staked there.  Several sleek brown dogs with massive heads and jowls are bound within the clearing, some slumbering peacefully, while others circle restlessly in the quiet night.",
