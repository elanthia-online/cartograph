    "The cobblestones turn through an area of tightly clustered cottages set across from a high wooden fence that borders the street, forming a narrow alleyway.  Some local artist has painted the fence with a fanciful mural of a group of trolls and giants engaged in some bloody sport.  Clumps of grass and a few weeds grow along the fence and between the old cobblestones."
