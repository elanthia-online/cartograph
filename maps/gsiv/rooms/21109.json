    "The sound of various birds trill distantly from outside, muffled slightly by the sound of the stream that runs beneath this raised building.  A crude wheel lashed with carved wooden cups dips into a furrow built into the floor, catching the stream water within and turning slowly.  Channels of bamboo have been affixed to the thatched ceiling, the various holes drilled into them allowing the water from the cups to cascade down in a gentle raining shower to land in a large porcelain bathtub below.  A doorway leads out."
