  "description": [
    "Dark and bright green algae clings to the floor boards of the pier along the northwestern edge where the shadows of the nearby rocky shoals prevent the sunlight from drying the accumulated dampness.  Two arrows that are painted side-by-side part ways at the heart of the pier's walking space, with a blue one continuing to the northeast and a red one dipping in a southerly direction.  An arching sign tacked to two pilings marks this section as the entry to \"Pier 4.\""
