    "Bushes of holly grow in the shade of the snow-covered pines, their leaves frosted with sparkles of ice and their bright berries glowing red against the patterns of green and white.  Low snowbanks line the sides of the walk, broken by small paths dug out to lead to cottages back among the trees."
