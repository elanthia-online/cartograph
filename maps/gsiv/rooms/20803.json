    "You hear the soft sounds of a lullaby being sung nearby.  In one corner a rocking chair rocks as if it has just been vacated.  Walls of a soft blue, painted with scenes of unicorns, rabbits and deer frolicking, catch your eye and you swear that one of the deer winked at you.  Small cribs line one wall with a changing table sitting by the window.  A huge toy chest, overflowing with colorful toys to delight any youngster, draws your eye from the corner of the room."
