    "The flaring curves of five vertical fel beams give this chamber its shape -- tapering to meet overhead in a sky-reaching point.  A myriad of horizontal fel boards has been expertly fitted to the beams and sanded to give the dome its smooth outer skin.  Radiating outward to each of the five beams, a spiderweb of brass wire is inlaid in the fel floorboards of the chamber.  At the center of the pattern, a polished blue sphere rests atop a rune-engraved brass column inlaid with a tiny plinite chip.",
