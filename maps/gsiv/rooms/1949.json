    "A massive drilling rig is set against the tunnel's east wall, placed to excavate further into the rock.  The rig looks a bit like a huge metal mole, with a conical screw for a snout.  It is idle just now, as are the dwarves who operate it.  They lean on their picks and grumble.  One kneels to look under the mole and scratches his head."
