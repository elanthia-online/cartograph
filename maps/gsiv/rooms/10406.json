    "Silvery water pours down one side of the hallway, over striated stones set into glaes.  The water trickling and tumbling sends a light mist to coat this section of the hallway, as the restful sound echoes down the passage.  At the base of the wall a shallow willow basin catches the water, which is then somehow transported to the top to begin its fall again."
