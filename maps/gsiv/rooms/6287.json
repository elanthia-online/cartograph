    "The first thing you notice about this tunnel is that it is dark.  It's also the last thing you notice, as it is too dark to see much else.  To the south is the faint glimmer of...well...less darkness.  To the north you think you can make out a bend in the tunnel.  Actually it's just your over-active imagination, since it's too dark to really see the bend."
