    "Wrought iron railings coated with gilt resemble a diagonal weave of ivy, surrounding this small balcony overlooking the street.  A small trellis along the sides supports the tendrils from pots of bright violet flowering clematis.  Small cafe chairs and tables have been placed here for those wishing to rest a bit and enjoy some tea.",

A small trellis along the sides supports the tendrils from pots of flowering clematis, its blossoms spiraled tightly closed for the night.  Small cafe chairs and tables have been placed here for those wishing to rest a bit and enjoy some tea."
