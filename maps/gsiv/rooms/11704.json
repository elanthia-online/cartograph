    "Large blocks of stone, fallen from somewhere above on the wall, lie scattered about the pathway that now follows the wall along its east-west direction.  North of the wall, the earthen barriers protecting the keep are lower and narrower than those to the south, which almost vanish under marsh grass and reeds."
