  "description": [
    "Several sturdy chairs sit grouped in a corner of this dusty lobby.  A low murmur of conversation hangs in the air as various travellers pass by, occasionally stopping a moment to chat about the weather or share the latest gossip.  A group of sweating dwarves tow a heavy chest towards the door, grumbling as they strain at the tow ropes."
