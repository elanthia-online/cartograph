    "Underfoot, plush ivory-colored carpet spreads from wall to wall, and dozens of ornate mirrors hang on the deep blue watersilk walls.  The corners on each of the mirror frames have been inlaid with silvery conch shells.  Underneath each mirror stand tables with gilded edges, each bearing transparent quartz vases with a bouquet of blood-red roses."
