    "The water-surrounded tunnel continues, following a sharp curve.  A group of thin silver fish hovers near the turn, darting around the watery space as if they were controlled by one brain.  Occasionally, a larger fish will swim in close to the school, causing the little creatures to scatter, though they quickly regroup."
