  "description": [
    "A few rocks have fallen from above, splattering dirt on the smooth walls and half-covering the relatively fresh skeleton of a gnome.  The poor fellow looks to have been trapped in the landslide, but his bones have been picked almost clean - only tatters of flesh and leather clothing remain.  The stone clutched in his bony hand and the odd scratches on the wall indicate that perhaps he had tried to write something before he expired."
