    "The pool here is swarming with many differing species of small fish, all swimming peacefully among the weeds.  You can see several varieties of colorful guppies, minnows and fresh water damselfish and a few that you don't recognize.  The slate path slopes downward to the east, leading to another part of the zoo."
