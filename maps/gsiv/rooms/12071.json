    "The lake bottom dips drastically at this point and darker, deeper water spreads to the south and east.  Leafy topped water plants reach toward the surface of the water, roots and stalks lost from sight in the depths below.  An occasional \"plop\" and rippled splash disturbing the surface of the lake provides a quiet counterpoint to the constant lapping sound of waves against the northern shore."
