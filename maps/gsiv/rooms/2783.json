    "No more than an alcove tucked beneath the wide staircase, this cozy nook is dominated by an imposing oak desk cluttered with papers.  Sitting on a table-easel amidst the debris is a small painting of a whiskered halfling.  Next to the portrait is a paper-weight that reads \"Office.\"  A narrow hall passes the desk and continues around the corner, its length hung with paintings of mountain scenes inspired, very likely, by local panoramas."
