    "White-striated ivy vines twist their way through the verdant canopy, adding a touch of paler hues to the dark browns and greens of the jungle.  New growth twists across the crushed cinnamon bark path that bisects the area, while heart-shaped leaves create a framework that allows for a clear view of the tropical clearing to the west."
