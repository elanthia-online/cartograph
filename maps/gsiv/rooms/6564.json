  "description": [
    "The castle yard ends here, at a wall topped by crenellations that extends between the wall surrounding the inner ward and the exterior curtain wall.  A corridor with a fine, carved doorcase passes through the barrier, revealing its width to be more than ten spans.  The remains of an iron gate lie on the ground a short distance away."
