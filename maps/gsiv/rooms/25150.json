  "description": [
    "Black ora gates and high walls of sandstone erupt from the untamed desert, heralding a high spire with a wide compound at its base.  An immense serpent of bronze and copper clings to the tower, climbing up toward a windowed dome at its zenith.  Sunlight reflects off of windows of stained glass, and its heat awakens a faint odor of decay from the entire place."
