    "Made of shining bronze and adorned with glistening obsidian, two doors rise high and wide above the fine tiled floors, now faded and covered with dust.  A shriveled corpse sits with its back against the wall, its leather armor brittle and cracked and a rusty shortsword still encased in its bony grip."
