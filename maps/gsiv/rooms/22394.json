    "Rectangular tiles of blue-flecked white marble comprise the hallway's floor, lined with moss green runners embroidered with tawny whorls.  A blue sapphire-inset door resides in the eastern wall, while a set of tall silver-traced doors occupies the terminus of the corridor.  Within a modest recess nearest to the antechamber, a simple stone door has been partially hidden behind a velvety blue curtain."
