    "Molds have grown on the white, reflective tile walls of the Surgery.  In the center of the room is a sturdy wooden surgical table large enough to hold a giantkin.  Large brass oil lamps are hung in the four corners of the room and a fifth lamp hangs directly above the table.  A skeleton is crumpled in the corner of the room.  Another remains strapped to the surgical table.  Scalpels, clamps, and other surgical instruments are scattered around the room."
