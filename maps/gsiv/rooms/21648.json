    "The fel balustrade curves inward slightly, forming a smooth curve that ends beside the door set in the southern wall.  A golden tinged carpet with crimson fringe covers the floor, leaving thin edges of hardwood exposed.  Two paintings hang close together on the crimson wall, their golden frames complementing the carpet."
