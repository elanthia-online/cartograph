    "Polished walls of honey and black oak inlaid in a pattern of interlocking chevrons define the hallway of the annex that leads to the cauldron practice rooms.  Water flows slowly over a sheet of glass overlaying the woodwork in the corner, with occasional ripples betraying the presence of etchings in the glass."
