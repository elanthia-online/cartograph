    "Tables and chairs of all shapes, sizes and states of disrepair fill this large, undecorated chamber.  Seated at many of the tables are groups intent on serious card games.  From the far side of the room you hear the noisy cheers of a ragtag group of spectators rooting for the underdog in a wristwrestling match between the local blacksmith and an overfed member of the Wehnimer's Citizens' Militia."
