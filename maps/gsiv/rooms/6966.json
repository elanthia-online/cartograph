    "The deep gorge narrows here, and a huge log convieniently spans the gap between the sheer walls.  This end of the log is rotted and jagged, making you wonder if it was cut or fell here.  In either case, it provides access to the other side.  A wide path also extends along the gorge here, to the west."
