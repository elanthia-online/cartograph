    "On the west side of the north wing's roof stands a wall where several slices of tree trunk are affixed.  Pinned to these are three archery targets painted blue, green, and red, each with concentric rings of white, black, blue, red and the bull's eye of gold in the center.  Opposite the targets stands a rack of equipment."
