  "description": [
    "Here, in a small clearing surrounded by a thick tangle of bushes, is an odd thing.  Set into the ground is a large wood-fired burner.  Looking closer, you see scattered bits of half-burned wood and charcoal everywhere.  Next to the burner is a massive pile of wood in all shapes and sizes.  Beyond the sooty greenery, pale reddish rock walls block all further view."
