  "description": [
    "The wagon is rather small and could only house a handful of occupants, at least comfortably.  One corner of the floor is covered in colorful stuffing and red paint as if it were the aftermath of a toy onslaught, while a tiny red music box rests upon a stand and fills the wagon with an eerie dirge."
