    "The surrounding trees have been thinned out a bit, allowing one to glimpse the tops of Ta'Illistim's taller buildings over the high walls.  The faint sound of trickling water echoes throughout the area, while clusters of flamestalks and orchids flank the cobblestoned path, their dark hues contrasting with the occasional pale pansy."
