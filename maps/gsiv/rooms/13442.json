    "The dank corridor ends suddenly at a thick greystone wall that contrasts with the natural granite surroundings.  A metal torch sconce bolted to the stone has been exposed to the dampness for so long, it is covered with deep crimson-hued rust.  Streaks from the corrosion stain the wall below, like small rivers of dried blood."
