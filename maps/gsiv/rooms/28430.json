    "This is a very large, partially flooded, stone room.  The uneven floor provides a mostly dry walkway to help visitors circumnavigates pools of stagnant water.  Primitive torches lining the walls provide nothing more than unhospitable light and menacing shadows.  Some signs are posted at intervals between ancient, empty wine racks."
