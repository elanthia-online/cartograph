    "Perhaps the brightest room in the building, the kitchen is exceptionally well lit and overly warm from the blazing dual brick ovens.  Greasy spills dot the clay-tiled floor, having left their stains behind in the absorbent surface.  Crates of fruits and vegetables stack up against the walls, and choice meats drain over a blood-filled pan, from their ceiling hooks in a small dim alcove to the east."
