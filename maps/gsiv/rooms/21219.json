    "A silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A braided seagrass rug sits in one corner of a smooth slate floor.  There is an aqua-hued seaglass display on one side of the shop and a series of low oak shelves on the other."
