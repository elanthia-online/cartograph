    "A few gigantic mushrooms have sprouted along the ceiling, and from their immense size, it's apparent that the climate of the warrens is contributing greatly to their growth.  A faint glow emanates from several of the mushrooms, evidently an odd side effect of a thick green moss that has attached itself to them in parasitic fashion."
