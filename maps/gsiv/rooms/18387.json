    "You're riding atop a soft cushion of straw in the back of a large and sturdy wagon.  Piles of hay are stacked all around you in a semi-organized fashion, along with a few other packaged goods.  Behind you on the seat of the wagon, the back of the driver's head, which is topped with a muss of brown hair, is clearly visible.  In front of you, the view out the back of the wagon is fairly uninhibited, though at times, the passing scenery seems to waver."
