    "Detailed wooden mannequins wearing a variety of leather armor and robes stand behind glass screens to keep them safe.  Dressed the way they are, with their well made uniforms, the mannequins resemble real soldiers standing at attention.  Globed lanterns create a series of dancing shadows along the walls and further enhance the illusion that the mannequins are sentient beings."
