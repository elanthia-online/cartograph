    "The bridge shudders slightly under the added weight, wobbles from side to side, but then becomes stable once again.  Branches reach out from the surrounding oaks, their leaf-covered fingers clutching at the bridge.  A circular clearing opens in the woods below, decaying stumps and withered foliage evident from this height.  A rank odor, like the heavy scent of muck or bog slime, rises from the clearing and wafts through the air.",
