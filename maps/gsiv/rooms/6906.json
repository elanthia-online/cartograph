    "The darkness in this room is nearly complete, with only the faintest glow of light for comfort.  The blackness seems almost alive, whispering with voices that have no source and caressing with fingers that have no substance.  Only that fitful radiance keeps it all at bay, keeping the living safe in a place ruled by the dead."
