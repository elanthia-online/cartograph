    "Bullfrogs croak deeply, unable or unwilling to keep a harmony in the reeds that line the bank of the slow-moving river.  Moonlight filtering through the trees dapples the ground along the path, illuminating the matted leaves and barren spots.  The trees are clustered together, and in many places the moonlight is almost totally blocked.  At these spots toadstools grow abundantly around the bases of the trees, and the rocks are covered with heavy moss.",
