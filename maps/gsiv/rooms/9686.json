    "A quaint bungalow rests quietly alongside a bubbling brook teeming with an assortment of fish and other aquatic life, creating a picture perfect scene.  The delicate lace curtains from the window of the cobbler's cobby billows gently on a soft breeze.  Fiddlehead ferns surround the brook on all sides and clusters of holly trees, crowned with bright red berries and glossy evergreen leaves house a huge host of birds.  The air fills with a melodious harmony as they trill their songs.",
