    "The trail passes through a large clearing surrounded by tall chestnut trees.  A few crabapple trees have sprouted here and there across the clearing, the random pattern perhaps related to the many boar tracks that circle the trees.  Overhead, a buzzard can be seen patrolling the forest in a wide, lazy circle."
