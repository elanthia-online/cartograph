    "The path widens around a huge fountain that has been built around a towering golden griffin statue.  Water sprays from the feather tips of the beast's outspread wings, pouring down into three tiers of carved stone basins.  Surrounding the walkway is a grove of short gnarled trees, each home to a host of bromeliads and flowering orchids."
