    "Small and messy, the floor of the room is littered with an array of colored cotton threads and pointed silver needles.  Numerous overstuffed beanbags are placed around the room, each one covered with floral-patterned fabric.  A large oak table dominates the center of the room, and shows signs of years of use."
