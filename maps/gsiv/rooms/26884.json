    "Unlike the village's typically narrow thoroughfares, the streets in either direction widen and join to form this comfortably spacious plaza.  The plaster-covered walls of the buildings are in better repair than in other neighborhoods, and the gates around a heavily wooded path leading toward Duskruin Arena are free of rust."
