    "This large circular chamber is made entirely of oak, from the walls and floors to the benches and many chairs that fill the space.  An immense curved table dominates the room.  Within the open center of the table sits a large bench, and numerous chairs surround the outside of the table and each wall.  A large embroidered tapestry adorns the far wall, displaying the house crest for all within this chamber."
