    "[Ice Cave]"

  "description": [
    "This small cave is filled with shadows, the only illumination provided by a dim ray of light that peeks through an opening in the southern wall.  In the cave's center is a fire pit, its rim ringed with a number of scorched rocks.  Overhead, a multitude of designs cover the walls and ceiling, incised upon the rock with rich earth tones.  Noticeable by its lack of ornamentation is a small silhouette on the east wall, the crevice about the size of a halfling.  Dense shadows cloak the back of the cave."
