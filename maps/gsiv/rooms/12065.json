    "Water from a wide shallow lake to the east pushes its way between two natural ramparts of granite and tumbles down a short waterfall into the bed of a river running to the south.  A spindly sapling perches on the edge of the northern wall of rock, leaning precariously out over the lake like a skinny youth contemplating a dive into the murky depths below."
