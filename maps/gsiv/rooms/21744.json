    "The small spring is lined with a brilliant array of colorful stones.  Exotic plants, carefully arranged to provide privacy, grow in profusion along the bank.  A tall willow tree leans gracefully over the spring, as if granting its blessing on the swimmers.  The bottom of the spring is lined with fine sand, oddly warm to the feet.  Air bubbles rush up from below, tickling the bare parts of your skin.  A small waterfall trickles musically down a jumble of rocks, and a small wooden fishing dock juts out from a sandy bank."
