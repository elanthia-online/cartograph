    "Many of the dwellings that line this section of road have shutters closed or curtains drawn to keep out the noise and dust raised by the constant flow of traffic along the street.  Just south of here, the traffic on Cheridin streams west towards the bazaar.  To the east, the lanes twist through neighborhoods composed of serviceable shops and modest residences."
