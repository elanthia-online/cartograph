  "description": [
    "The room is airy, caressed as it is by a gentle breeze scented with the fragrance of a potted jasmine plant beneath the open window.  Light oak wall panels add to the sense of openness.  A puma-hide rug lies at the foot of a four-posted bed dominating the room's corner opposite the window."
