    "Jagged crags of stone tower up on either side from a broken field of boulders made more treacherous by ice and snow.  The gorge snakes its way west, twisting out of sight around a large outcrop of stone protruding from the north face in the distance.  Here and there, scraggly bushes crouch between the rocks, their branches cloaked in a layer of ice."
