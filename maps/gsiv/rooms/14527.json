    "A thin brown snake hangs in loose coils from a leaning eucalyptus tree, causing a group of triton cockatoos to screech continually, obviously agitated.  Seeming completely undisturbed, the serpent basks, remaining unmoving and unperturbed.  Small sickle and fishbone ferns cling to the base of the tree, their curled fronds winding into its lower branches."
