    "Wooden benches lay broken in the dried reeds of the settlement, the seating encircling a large rectangular table, its legs licked by dark-colored scorch marks.  Crumpled maps and scrolls lay spread across the table's surface, the ivory parchment stained crimson, ruining the elaborate labeling of various towns and roads.  Sets of riveted armor and weaponry sit behind the table, barely concealing the pile of yellowing bones buried beneath them."
