    "A thin finger of stone points through the pass toward the peaks beyond.  Peering down, your eyes can follow the trail as it winds through ice and snow, valley and ridge, tundra and forest--all of the strata that make up the alpine landscape.  From this commanding height, your voice can project across great distances.",
    "A thin finger of stone points through the pass toward the peaks beyond.  Peering down, you can see nothing but a vast, even limitless, emptiness.  It is impossible to know how far one one's voice might project from such a commanding position."
