    "A pair of dwarven-proportioned mannequins, one covered in leather and one in suede, frame each side of the doorway, staring across a narrow aisle at each other.  Beyond one mannequin, hooks have been carved from the living stone of the wall, but remain empty while the opposite side has been formed into a large rack.  The back wall of this cozy shop has been taken up by a motif of a golden suede anvil on a wide brown leather backing."
