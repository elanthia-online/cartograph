    "Voracious flames attacked this room as well, blackening the walls and ceiling, and turning most of the furniture into crumbling cinder.  A small mattress has been slashed open, its stuffing spilling out next to the smashed remains of a wooden rocking horse.  The smoke covered faces of ceramic dolls, crushed beneath some terrible force, stare up woefully from the ashes that cover the floor."
