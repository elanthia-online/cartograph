    "Intricate wooden cut-outs have been dyed and inlaid into the surface of this varnished oak table.  Clusters of grapes, ranging from deep purple to succulent red and topped with dark green leaves, adorn the outer edge.  Twining tendrils of vines connect each cluster to the next.  An etched silver bowl sits in the middle of the table, bearing several clusters of polished glass grapes in vibrant colors."
