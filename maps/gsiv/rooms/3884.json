  "description": [
    "This huge, circular, deep stone pit assaults the nose with the odor of sweat and blood.  The sand floor still bears traces of the last battle that took place here - obviously a place where warriors can fight honorable battles for practice and pleasure.  Above are seat indentations within the stone walls so that spectators can watch and cheer without being hit accidentally, or sprayed with the combatants' bodily fluids."
