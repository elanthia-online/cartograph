  "description": [
    "Polished teak floors gleam beneath a delicate patina of lacquer and reflect the warm glow of the elaborate chandelier.  A violet rug supports a claw-foot low mahogany table and is surrounded by armchairs and loveseats, whose backs are carefully positioned to face the linen-framed windows.  Occupying the eastern wall, a marble-mantled fireplace is surrounded by a whitewashed haon door on one side and a linden-edged white door on the other."
