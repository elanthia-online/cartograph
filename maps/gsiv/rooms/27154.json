    "Stacks of wine cases serve as creaky wooden walls in this back room of the tent, bits of protective straw peeking through the seams of their pine surfaces.  Atop a felt-surfaced table, individual champagne bottles sit on display, alongside flutes, glasses, and other accoutrements of wine-drinking."
