    "A large corn crib stands just to the south, awaiting the harvest that is yet to come.",
    "A large corn crib stands just to the south, awaiting the harvest that is yet to come.  Long cedar slats are nailed to tall cedar beams, with just enough space in between the slats to allow air circulation to dry the feed corn.  The cribs are only three feet deep but ten feet high and fifteen feet wide.  A large, hinged door in the top allows corn to be poured in from above, while a small door at the bottom center of each crib allows the dried feed corn to be removed.  No corn occupies the crib."
