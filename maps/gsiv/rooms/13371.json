  "description": [
    "The hallway ends in a wide circular chamber, its crimson-hued walls covered with a variety of large tapestries depicting various trees and flowers upon a rolling landscape.  Silvery patterns run along the ceiling, flowing down along the walls to edge the floor in their twining embrace.  A large chandelier sways softly above the center of the room, its brilliant flames ensconced by rainbow-hued panes of crystal that cast glimmering shards of vivid hues across the chamber."
