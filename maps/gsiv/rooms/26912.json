    "A swinging fel door affords entry into a spacious kitchen, its walls lined with rich mahogany cupboards filled with black glaes dishware, bottles and jars.  The black marble countertops are laden with heavy maoral cutting boards and razor-sharp knives.  Dominating one entire wall is a large bookcase with rows and rows of dusty and worn books.  A gilt-framed picture hangs slightly askew next to the bookcase."
