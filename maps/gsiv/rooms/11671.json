  "description": [
    "Empty weapon racks have been torn from the walls.  In the back of the shack are a dust-covered forge and a large, rusty anvil.  Strewn across the wide-planked floor are a few broken stools and an overturned wooden bench.  The smell of mold and dust permeate the wooden building.  A set of crude steps lead up through a small trapdoor in the ceiling."
