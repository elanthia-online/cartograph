    "Braided hemp cords arc outward from the central support post to create a latticework design across the top of the ceiling that binds the sturdy canvas panels in place both above and along the three walls.  Cracked barrels and oaken hampers lay in a disorganized mess about the area, their contents strewn or heaped in odd piles.  An exasperated dwarf mutters to herself as she attempts to draw the chaos into order by folding several robes into tidy piles along the back wall."
