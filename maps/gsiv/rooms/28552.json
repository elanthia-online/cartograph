  "description": [
    "Sporadic eruptions of lightning paint the uneven columns of the arena in a stark, monochrome palette and causes them to throw fitful shadows across the black sand underfoot.  Across the field, the only deviation to the continuous black is the occasional flash of white.  Closer examination reveals a femur here, a jawbone there, and it is soon obvious that nothing that survives here leaves whole, evidenced both by the remains left in haphazard repose and the shattered sky above."
