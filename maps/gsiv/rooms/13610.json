    "White brocade walls rise from a sanded pine floor.  Just above a serene golden wyvern fountain hangs a pair of crossed cavalry sabers, and an elegantly arched fel ceiling completes the picture.  A twisted dark metal rack and an intricately carved ebonwood stand stand side by side in the middle of the room."
