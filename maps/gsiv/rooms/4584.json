    "An elegant stairway dominates this spacious foyer as it curves round and round leading up to the second floor.  Suspended from the balustrade above is a dark green silk banner that has been embroidered with the words, \"Welcome One And All,\" in gold thread.  Polished to a shine, the speckled marble floor is uncluttered, save for an elaborately made coat rack with carved seashells."
