  "description": [
    "In this cluster of two dozen enormous banyans, it becomes difficult to distinguish what set of woody tubers belong to each specific tree as the makeshift trunks entwine freely.  Spreading round crowns of elliptical leaves cover the area above with a thick yellow-green canopy.  Much further below, aerial-generated roots dig shallowly into the earth to produce a thin surface network.  On some of the largest of these strangler figs, scaly grey bark has fallen off to expose a smooth black inner core."
