  "description": [
    "Heavy oak doors open into the expansive lobby of the Moonglae Inn.  Greystone walls rise high overhead, where polished ironwood beams reinforce the sharply sloping roof.  Bustling porters usher new guests toward the front desk, while other visitors mingle in small groups, discussing the news of the day.  The room is dominated by a large eahnor planter circled by a round sofa that sits atop a plush red carpet in the center of the room."
