    "A magnificent modwir armoire and long tapestry dominate this room, which is lined with various pieces of artwork.  Among other pieces of note are an exceptionally well-crafted shadowbox and an elegant oil painting.  Off in a corner of the room stand a stone bust and a bronze statue, each on their own marble pedestal."
