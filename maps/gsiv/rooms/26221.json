    "Heading north from an ebon gate, a dirt path, as well as a bridge beyond, are barricaded with fallen trees.  Charred trunks of varying girths lay crisscrossed atop one another like matchsticks dropped from their box.  Evidence of fiery devastation blankets the surrounding swampland.  In the darkness, only a faintly discernable path, more like an animal trail, remains passable and leads off toward the east."
