    "Several tall sycamore trees loom close to the barley plants.",
    "Several tall sycamore trees loom close to the barley plants.  The sycamore roots heave up the ground all around the trees, disturbing the barley plants nearby and sucking water and nutrients from the soil.  However, the sycamores make up for this by providing a windbreak.  The trees' spreading branches and wide leaves act like natural baffles, intercepting the wind gusts and calming them into soft, gentle breezes."
