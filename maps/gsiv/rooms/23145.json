    "[A Bubbling Hot Spring]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Shooting forth from a single hole in the stone floor of the pool, the spring pierces the surface and rises several inches before coming down in a shower of drops.  Mist wafts up from the warm water, though you can still see the entire garden through the hazy air.  Draining through a rectangular notch that is cut into the southern lip of the pool, the water cascades down a series of stone steps before turning westward and forming a small stream."
