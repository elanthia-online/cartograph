    "The ground underfoot here is damp and shifts slightly when trod upon.  The clumps of wild grass are thriving, their slender stalks and blades standing tall in the moonlight.  Small patches of mold cling to the lower portions of the tree trunks, and a dank fetid scent exudes from the moist earth.",
    "The ground underfoot here is damp and shifts slightly when trod upon.  The clumps of wild grass are thriving, their slender stalks and blades painted in vibrant green hues.  Small patches of dull grey mold cling to the lower portions of the tree trunks, and a dank fetid scent exudes from the moist earth."
