    "A witchwood library table, which is surrounded by straight-backed chairs, dominates the center of the room and is illuminated by several candelabra for those who enjoy late night reading.  Moonlight filters softly through silken curtains, causing them to glow slightly in contrast to the wooden bookshelves that line the walls.  Underneath each window is a maoral bench, the soft satin cushions providing excellent perches from which to read a favorite book."
