    "Thick, garnet-colored carpeting extends from the main room into this quiet nook.  Several small tables are clustered in the center of the room, while long shelves hang from the walls, displaying a wide array of trinkets.  Warm light flickers from a small bronze chandelier hanging directly above the tables."
