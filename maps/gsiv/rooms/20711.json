    "A plush green rug with an ivy motif covers the floor, and several tables are scattered at one end of the room, each illuminated by a low, tallow candle.  Framed paintings of local wildlife dot the ivory walls, their contents shadowed by the dim lighting.  Across the room from the gaming tables, soft gold sofas are arranged in a circle, with several potted ferns placed between them.  The scents of tobacco and alcohol linger here, dispersed only by drafts entering through a curved ebonwood arch that serves as the only exit."
