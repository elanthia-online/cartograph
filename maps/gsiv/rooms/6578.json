  "description": [
    "From the high vantage point of this wall-walk, there is an excellent view of the western outer yard and the towers and spires of the castle itself.  The walk is built in attractive tiers, with balustrades ornamented with the masterful carving seen throughout the old fortification.  Two gargoyles peer down from crannies on the towers that flank the walk, their contorted appearance whimsical and forbidding as well."
