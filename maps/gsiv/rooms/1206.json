    "The trail narrows here and the branches of the trees meet over your head, casting deep shadows all around.  You brush against a pine tree and pick up a smear of gluey black sap down your arm.  The sharp scent of the resin bites your nose and throat, and your attempts to clean the goop off only spreads it around."
