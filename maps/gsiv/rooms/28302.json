  "description": [
    "The glass doors open out into an expansive, green oak timber-framed space that runs the full length of the house.  Panes of glass make up the walls and vaulted ceiling, granting views of the low-walled rosarium beyond and allowing moonlight to flood the room.  Cup-shaped blooms encircling the area match the yellow and cream rose-printed cushions atop the wrought metal chairs, the seating paired around small mirror-topped tables and strategically placed potted mulberry trees."
