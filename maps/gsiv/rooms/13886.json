  "description": [
    "The Gullet converges with the blossoming tunnel, which opens to meet Rubblestone Pool.  Ne'halin River's near presence adds its chorus, as well as a brisk current which sends an intermittent spray of water over the walk.  The mithril braziers burn seamlessly, rendered immune to the occasional mists by thick crystal panes held securely in the lamps' filigree."
