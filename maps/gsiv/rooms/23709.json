  "description": [
    "Arrow slits ominously line both sides of the wooden entryway leading from the outside to the inside of the Hendoran outpost.  Just wide enough to allow a wagon to squeeze through, the hard-packed earthen floor slopes inward guiding absent feet to the center of the space.  Overhead three trapdoors punctuate the length of the ceiling between a thick oaken gate on one end and a black iron portcullis on the other."
