    "High in the branches of the oak, the thick growth of limbs, intersecting and crossing, offers an easy passageway between the trees.  The boughs are wide and easily traversed, and the moonlight is brighter here.  Far below, the shadowy forms of some large boulders on the forest floor are occasionally visible through breaks in the dense foliage."
