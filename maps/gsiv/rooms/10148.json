  "description": [
    "Marsh reeds rise out of the thick, odorous mud, the gnarled stalks forming a small thicket.  Fallen ironwood trees lie scattered about the obscured path, the aged logs covered with ferns and white lichen.  A wooden plank has been placed over a murky pond filled with miniature lily pads, the rickety board making a path through the tall brush to the north.  Swamp roses and magnolia shrubs trim the edge of the pond, creating a diorama of color that contrasts sharply with the surrounding mire."
