    "The broad room is well-lit and meticulously clean.  Row upon row of shelves displaying a multitude of goods fill the back part of the room, and a polished oak counter stands near the door, upon which sits a a sturdy scale, a black-inked sign, and a mist-filled silver bowl.  Brass lanterns are mounted on the walls, casting a warm glow over the wood-paneled walls and floor and driving the shadows out from between the shelves.",
