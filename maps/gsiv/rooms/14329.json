    "Tables and chairs of deeply polished mahogany lend a simple elegance to this area.  A polished oak bar spans the length of the room across from the large granite fireplace that dominates the south wall.  The barkeeper presides merrily, ensuring everyone gets a share of attention from the pretty serving wenches and the handsome lad behind bar."
