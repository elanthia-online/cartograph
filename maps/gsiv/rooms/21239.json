    "The broad sweep of the limestone floor is interrupted by a woven Vornavian silk rug.  Halfway to the white stucco ceiling, a multihued Vornavian silk tapestry hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls.  Some wrought-iron hooks and a beveled glass-covered case are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
