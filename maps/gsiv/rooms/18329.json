  "description": [
    "Ripples created by the waterfall feeding the lagoon provide enough motion to keep the glistening black liquid moving almost constantly as it laps in one direction or another.  Reflecting from the mirror-like surface of the water, moonlight plays across the lagoon in a neverending dance of pale beams, while deeper below, the shadows shift with the current.  The melody of the nearby waterfall is only occasionally broken by the call of a nocturnal creature."
