    "Spherical white paper lanterns dangle from the limb-woven ceiling overhead, their exteriors painted with a variety of flora and fauna in a myriad of hues.  Along the tent walls, strands of rope hang against the suede in graceful scallops and are bedecked in an array of colorful feathers.  Underfoot, a round rug of woven cloth scraps occupies the heart of the floor and pads each footfall."
