    "Warm sunlight slips in through the glaes windows that dominate the southern section of the shop, the golden light shining off of the polished planks that are on display.  Signs over each grouping denote the types of wood and dyes available for purchase, while others denote which are for upper decks and which are for interior use.  A wide oak counter edged in brass railings sits upon a slate blue rug, while a sign above proclaims, \"Order Here\" in bold, blocky letters."
