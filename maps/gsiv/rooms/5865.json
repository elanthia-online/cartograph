    "Beneath the gracefully oscillating branches of a willow tree sits a white marble headstone, gleaming in the sunlight that filters through the willows branches.  The square-cut, simplistic sculpting of the headstone is elegant in its design.  Willow leaves, scattered on the ground, accent the serene resting place.",
