    "A neatly tended garden, oddly out of place in the otherwise marshy environment, flourishes within a tall, wire-fenced area.  Bright ribbons decorate the fence posts and wind through the wire enclosure.  A leaf-stuffed scarecrow, draped in a pink floral dress, sports a oversized lady's hat with furling ribbons dancing in the lightest breeze.",
