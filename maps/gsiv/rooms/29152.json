    "Circles of paint decorate the smooth wood of the pier, each green dot filled with a bright white number ranging from 11 and 15.  Heavy ropes sway in the seaborne breeze from their anchoring points on the surrounding support posts, the looping cords forming a simple railing to prevent accidental slips into the ocean beyond.  Someone has tied various knots onto a mooring clamp, the frayed ends flitting in the air."
