    "[Spitfire, 'Tween Deck Hatch]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A hatch conceals stairs leading down to the 'tween deck.  The stairs shine with polish, and modwir handrails on each side are supported with brass hardware.  Lanterns are fixed to the walls inside the hatch coaming, their wicks protected from windy days at sea by clear crystal panes.  Laughter and conversation drift up from the dim interior downstairs."
