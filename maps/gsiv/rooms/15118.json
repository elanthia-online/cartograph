    "A ruby-eyed grinning skull hangs on one of the smooth granite walls, and an ebonwood beam ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on one side of the shop and a bamboo rack on the other."
