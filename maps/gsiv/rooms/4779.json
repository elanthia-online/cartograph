    "The leafy undergrowth has been trampled, as if by scores of small rodents.  Although clusters of fungi cling to the damp bark of the trees, much of the fungal growth appears to have been harvested.  Broken stems and minute stumps protrude where thick clusters may have once stood.  A glistening film of thin mud has been spread across the clipped areas, perhaps intended to foster new growth.",
