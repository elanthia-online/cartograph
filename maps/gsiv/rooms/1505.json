  "description": [
    "A waist-high black iron and golden glaes fence surrounds the grounds of Eonak's Temple to the north.  No gate or archway marks the entrance, yet a broad, flagstone road leads from the esplanade towards the stone bulk of the temple.  Columns of heat-distorted air rise from the squat domes of the charcoal furnaces and the forges ranged beyond the temple proper.",
    "A tall black iron and white imflass fence encircles the grounds of Fasthr's Lance to the north.  Winding through a spade-topped stygian steel gate, a broad flagstone road leads from the esplanade toward the stone bulk of the tower.  Whitewashed and tall, the tower rises from a courtyard atop a green hillock."
