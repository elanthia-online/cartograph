  "description": [
    "Narrow columns of light filter down from small openings in the ceiling where the corrosive acidity of the groundwater has eroded through the limestone.  Multiple stalactites have formed around each opening, where mineralization of the seepage leaves a buildup of calcite and gypsum slowly dripping downward.  The largest of the tapering formations is taller than five giantmen standing on each other's shoulders and the smallest hang like delicate icicles, no longer than a forest gnome's pinky."
