  "description": [
    "A raucous raven call reverberates through the treetops, its point of origin hard to discern.  Directly southeast, a large island splits the flow of the Mistydeep River.  The western branch runs wide, swift, and deep while its other half progresses at a more leisurely pace, skimming small sandy shoals.  On both sides, clear pebbled basins provide hiding places for crafty fish at the river's bottom.  Far above, a dark granite tor rises sharply from the island's heavily-wooded heart."
