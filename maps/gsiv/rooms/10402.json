    "The pale marble and oak flooring in this section of the hallway is nearly obscured by an enormous crimson runner.  Stylized flames picked out in gold and red-tinged vaalin threads occupy the center of the carpeting.  An arch formed of ash-grey marble at the base blends into a deep red marble crazed with finger-like grey veins as it rises to a peak."
