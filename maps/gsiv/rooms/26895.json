    "Heavily patterned curtains made from forest-motifed figury flank a wide bay window at the back of the shop, casting faint sunlight over the richly polished mahogany floors and maoral walls.  Ornately woodworked banisters leading toward the southern wing extend from a glass-housed case appointed at the middle of the room."
