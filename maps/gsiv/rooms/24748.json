  "description": [
    "Salt, rust, and grime cover most of the portside wall's solitary porthole, although one spot has been smudged to relative cleanness to allow a small band of light to filter into the dusty companionway.  Rags litter the deck just beneath the porthole, some blackened with tar that has hardened to thumb-sized nodules."
