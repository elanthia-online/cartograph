    "Shelves, cases and boxes of all sizes line the walls of this little shop.  The items seem to be almost everything an apprentice wizard needs, and are carefully prepared for sale.  At the end of long strands of twine, crystal shards dangle from the ceiling, emitting a dull glow that illuminates the shop."
