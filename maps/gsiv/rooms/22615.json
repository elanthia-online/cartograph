    "The smell in this part of the hovel is positively rancid, though the origin of the stench is not readily apparent.  Bent nails protrude from the boards propping up the roof, and a variety of odds and ends dangle from them precariously.  Shoved against one wall are the remains of an old baby carriage, its wheels warped and its fabric canopy torn and threadbare.  Half of a hole-ridden barrel reaches out of the muck, its iron bandings rusted completely."
