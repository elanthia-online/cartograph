    "Thick mists drape over the snowy ground.  To the west, a small stream rushes by, gurgling.  Its crystal waters froth and foam as they cascade down the barren slope, enfolding the larger rocks of the stream bed that jut above the surface.  Slicks of calm water trail the rocks where the current is broken.  Not far below, the stream disappears into an alpine forest."
