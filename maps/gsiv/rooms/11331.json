    "A variety of cacti and sagebrush surrounded by desert flowers have been neatly planted in the sandy soil.  The hot, arid air seems to pull the moisture from your body, your sweat drying as soon as it reaches the surface of your skin.  The sandy path is slightly discolored from the tread of many feet."
