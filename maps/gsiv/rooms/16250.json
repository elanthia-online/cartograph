    "The triple canopy jungle blocks out nearly all the sunlight, leaving the area in a constant state of near darkness.  Short ferns with palmate leaves edged like daggers grow in profusion at the base of the tall trees.  Flowering vines drape from the lower limbs of the trees.  Fungus grows thick on the vines, giving them a green hairy appearance."
