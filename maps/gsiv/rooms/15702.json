    "The Temple Meeting Hall is an expansive space, although its ceiling barely clears six feet.  Its mithril doors open inward, swinging back to frame a promenade down the center of two banks of hand-carved benches.  Leather cushions on the benches provide a more comfortable seat atop the hard oak, and footrests add additional ease.  At the room's far wall, a raised dais holds a podium and a few imposing oak chairs with wide arms and tall backs."
