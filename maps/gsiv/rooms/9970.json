    "A sheer cliff, only about thirty feet high but far too sheer and slippery to climb here, rises to the next level of the plain, bounding the eastern edge of the field.  Tendrils of mist drift down the face of the cliff now and then, blown by the constant wind, and shade-loving bushes flourish in the shadow of the rocky barrier."
