    "An ivy vine grows in through a crack in the small rectangular window near the ceiling.  It has clambered and coiled its way across the ceiling, turning the oil lamp into a leafy bump.  One shoot of the vine has climbed down the wall and into the small meditation fountain, completely filling the basin.  Scattered about the floor are the remains of prayer rugs and the empty shreds of meditation cushions."
