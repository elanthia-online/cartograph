    "The gravel covered path veers to the west to avoid a cluster of trees.  Tall grasses surround a fallen tree, a charred victim of a lightning strike.  Nearby, a pebble-lined stream winds its way through the tall grass like a snake.  Centered in the stream is a stepping stone aligned with the path.",
    "The gravel covered path veers to the west to avoid a cluster of trees.  Tall grasses surround a fallen tree, a charred victim of a lightning strike.  Nearby, a pebble-lined stream crosses the path then continues to wind its way through the tall grass like a snake.  Reflected in the stream is the wavery image of a moon above.  Centered in the stream is a stepping stone aligned with the path."
