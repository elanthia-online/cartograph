  "description": [
    "A slow-moving, green tidal creek feeds into a wide, reed-choked, fetid mire.  Trees line both sides of the creek.  Some of the branches that would have overhung the creek have been systematically lopped off.  The scars left on those branches are grey and overgrown, indicating they were removed many years in the past.  Wisps of fog hover over the creek."
