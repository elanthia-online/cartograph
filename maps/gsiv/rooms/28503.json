  "description": [
    "Painted with overlapping, variegated, brown and green rectangles, like those on a turtle's shell, this circular table sports matching, pale-green chairs.  At the places where the arms, legs, head, and tail would be, the table is indented and painted black, so that the overall piece resembles a turtle tucked into its shell."
