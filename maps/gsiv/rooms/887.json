    "Hidden within the darkness of night, a small creature, perhaps a squirrel or chipmunk, berates the travelers below.  Its high-pitched screeching echoing off of the high walls, the tiny voice appears to be highly offended at this intrusion into its territory.  Although the chittering continues, its originator seems to be less than apt to back up its threats with physical force.",
    "Hidden amongst the thick shadows and scattered foliage of the canyon walls, a small creature, perhaps a squirrel or chipmunk, berates the travelers below.  Its high-pitched screeching echoing off of the high walls, the tiny voice appears to be highly offended at this intrusion into its territory.  Although the chittering continues, its originator seems to be less than apt to back up its threats with physical force."
