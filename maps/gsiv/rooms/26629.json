    "A slight alcove on the east side of the cottage holds a small mottled steel chest filled with neutrally hued tea packets and a plain oak box of coffee-filled packets illustrated with descriptive icons.  The rotted roof overhead is covered with a stained tarp, designed to keep out the elements, though its musty odor almost overshadows the fragrance of the various brews."
