    "Polished planks of mahogany make up the walls of this small shop.  Sputtering torches placed in brass sconces are angled perfectly to shine light down on an ironwood display case.  An old ivory-inlaid sea chest rests in a corner, its lid opened and slightly askew.  Stacks and stacks of books form somewhat of an aisleway that ends with a large piece of colorful sailcloth partially obscuring what looks like a doorway leading into an old storeroom."
