    "This rickety mossbark handcart leans slightly forward, threatening to spill its contents onto the ground if it weren't for the wheels being firmly entrenched in the marshy terrain.  A severely weathered red canvas hood provides the only source of protection from the surrounding elements for the handcart's cargo.  Resting atop the covered surface of the cart is a misshapen silver platter and an oblong pewter tray that have been piled high with an assortment of baked goods."
