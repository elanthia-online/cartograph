    "Lanterns light this windowless central chamber, where carved signs resembling small, locked strongboxes point to a curtained alcove and to hallways leading east and south.   A padlocked and barred double door closes off the entire western wing of the building from prying eyes and public access.  The wooden image of a wagon stacked high with lockers hangs above a doorway set in the northwest corner of the chamber."
