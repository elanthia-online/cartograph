    "A shadowy assassin tapestry hangs on one of the platinum-flecked alexandrite walls, and an ancient witchwood-beamed ceiling rises overhead.  A lone huntsman statue sits in one corner of a green marble-veined fissured brimstone floor.  There is a grooved sandstone table supported by a single haon pedestal on one side of the shop and a glaes-covered midnight blue mithril case with carved dragon-claw legs on the other."
