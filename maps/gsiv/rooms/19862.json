    "Glass-paned large windows stand between limestone pillars pockmarked with the images of past sealife.  Painted designs depict the image of well-tended vineyards, each artfully rendered to appear as if they are encroaching on the corridor, some even offer glimpses of globes of perfect near-ripe fruit under serrated leaves.   Tiles set into the ground amid the cobblestones are painted with grape clusters along the western wall, while opposite are woven reed prayer mats set before marble-framed alcoves."
