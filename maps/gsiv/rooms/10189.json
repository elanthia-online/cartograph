    "A beaten path cuts through the grass, leading off to the west and disappearing up the slope of the foothills to the east.  To the side of the path, as if mimicking in miniature the larger field, a number of ants trudge along a tiny trail that leads up into the hill that is their home.",
    "A beaten path cuts through the grass, leading off to the west and disappearing up the slope of the foothills to the east.  Fireflies dance in the grass on each side of the path, providing a faint flickering luminescence to light the way."
