    "Small pathways, not much wider than a bootprint, wind their brown and muddy scars through the stubbled grasses.  A low screened-in gazebo is surrounded by patches of varicolored bromeliads.  Tucked beneath the boughs of a sprawling runner oak, the structure provides respite from the buzzing of nighttime insects.  A deeper and more trodden set of bootmarks head south toward an enormous ancient banyan.",
