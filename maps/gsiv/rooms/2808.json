    "The tumbled boulders corrupting the trail become almost impassable here in the gorge's elbow.  Stone piled on cracked and icy layers of more stone threaten to clutch at feet and ankles.  Occasional fingers of bone reach up from the snowy rubble, marking where creatures have succumbed to the treachery of the course."
