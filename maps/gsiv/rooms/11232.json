    "Although dust-covered and draped with cobwebs, the once-vivid colors of this long, wide room are obvious.  Ceramic lamps in the shapes and colors of tropical birds hang from the ceiling.  The walls are painted to resemble a garden.  The frame of the modwir bed is painted a leafy green and the faded remnants of the comforters reveal a wildflower pattern.  A large ceramic urn stands beside the arched doorway."
