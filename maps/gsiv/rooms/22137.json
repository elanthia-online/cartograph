  "description": [
    "The walls and door are painted with a mural of a meadow and a bright blue sky.  Within the mural, along the far wall lies a red fox under a silver crescent moon.  A large, grass green, plush rug covers the wooden floor, continuing the feel of the outdoor scene.  Resting against the center of the left wall lies a neatly made bunk bed.  A huge display case sits opposite the foot of the bed on the right wall.  Overstuffed chairs can be found in either far corner of the room."
