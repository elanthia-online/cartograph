  "description": [
    "The corridor dwindles into nothing, choked by rough piles of rock and walls that draw together into a pinched termination.  Strewn with boulders and choked with thick piles of dust, the floor quickly grows impassable.  Marks are noticeable on the rough stone walls, the scores of chisel, hammer and pick."
