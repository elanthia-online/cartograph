  "description": [
    "At the end of a narrow bridge over a black and fathomless pit waits a low altar, long and flat.  But for a small space of encircling sandstone flooring, it is bordered by the pit on all sides.  Tiny lights, sallow gold and flashing crimson, wink from down below like fireflies, accompanied by an incongruous symphony of shuffling footsteps and uncertain groans."
