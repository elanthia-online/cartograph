    "The first thing you notice as you enter this room is the lack of a bed.  In its place is a gigantic pile of furs on which the occupant apparently takes his repose.  Weapon and armor racks flank both sides of the room, evidence that this is definitely the room of a warrior.  A huge oak keg of ale rests invitingly in one corner of the room.  Exquisite tapestries depicting fantastic battles and mountainous highland scenes adorn the walls."
