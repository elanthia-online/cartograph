    "Making your way along the ledge you catch yourself on a small boulder as you misstep and almost fall to the ground below.  The wind is bitter along this section of the path causing you to shiver and wish for a warm drink to soothe your chilled bones.  Just ahead you spy a path leading north into a large cavern."
