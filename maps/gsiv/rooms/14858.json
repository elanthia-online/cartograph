    "The trail winds its way around a particularly large and imposing oak, which dominates the area like an ancient sovereign.  Its branches droop almost to the ground, as though arraigned in vestments heavy with jewels, and its highest branches reach through the surrounding canopy and out of sight.  A bench sits just off the trail, in the dense shadow of one of the oak's protective branches.",
