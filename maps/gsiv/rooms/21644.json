    "Light blazes from a chandelier hanging from the center of the ceiling.  A short row of tilt-topped desks sits directly below the light, while lining the walls are all the necessary tools for copying manuscripts, binding books, and making endpapers.  A granite sink and marble countertop stand along the west wall."
