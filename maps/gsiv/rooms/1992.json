  "description": [
    "The road follows the river into a canyon, which narrows to the south.  The craggy, reddish-brown rock towers hundreds of feet overhead.  At the southern end of the canyon, a walled town sits at the base of the peak.  The clang of a bell and the distant bustle of the crowd drift along the canyon.  A squat barge plies the river toward the town, its deck piled high with fresh-cut timber and dozing dwarves."
