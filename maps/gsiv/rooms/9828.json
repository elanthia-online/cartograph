    "The overpowering scent of bile fills the tube-like chute as it curves upward.  Tiny pale, hair-like roots coat the smooth walls of the tube, their tips waving back and forth as they brush across your body.  The walls glisten with a slick substance that is moved along the chute with you, supported by the roots."
