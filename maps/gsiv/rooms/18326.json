    "The pale forms of clouds and the pinpoint lights of a myriad of stars are mirrored in the night-darkened water, drawing attention to the sheer black hue of the liquid in comparison.  Flitting across the water, the occasional firefly flashes a brilliant spark of light to break the shadows near the shoreline, before disappearing once more into the darkness of night."
