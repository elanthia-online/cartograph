    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a woven Vornavian silk rug.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls.  A gold-leafed mistwood cabinet and a Vornavian silk-covered table are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
