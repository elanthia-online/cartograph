  "description": [
    "To the east, only a tangle of downed saplings half-buried in rocky debris marks the end of the narrow trail.  Gaily clad shoppers attired in finery mingle with sailors from the nearby piers, bustling through the busy streets of the town below.  The aroma of roasting meats drifts upward on the rising breeze, seducing the occasional hunter to abandon this harsh and near-barren terrain."
