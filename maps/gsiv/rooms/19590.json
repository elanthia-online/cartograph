    "Slanting across the Great Hall's entrance, golden sunlight reflects off of the glass panes set within its doors and creates a prismatic spray of light that dances in the area.  Creeper vines, festooned with golden flaeshorn berries and bright red flowers, shroud the building's peak and fill the air with their sweet scent.  From somewhere in their depths, a morning dove coos a soft song, while a lark trills in accompaniment.",
    "Glittering lanterns rise to either side of the Great Hall's entrance, their warm glow drawing cicada and moths alike, as they illuminate the bend in the cobblestone path.  Though shrouded in shadows, the peak of the building is sensed by the slice of stars in the night sky that is missing and the absence of the shore sounds that its large presence blocks.  A quiet song lifts on the air, its tune sweet enough to lighten the darkness."
