    "Blue-speckled sea glass walls rise from a swirled sea glass floor.  Just above a well-pruned lemon tree hangs a faded treasure map, and a low skylight-set ceiling completes the picture.  A heavy lead glass display case and a glass-topped mistwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
