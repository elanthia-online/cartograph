    "A faint note of ozone hangs lightly in the air, aptly playing off the sky blue tones used in the niche's interior.  Finely honed woodworking skills are presented in the forms of a glossy mahogany counter and a lacquered oak table placed at the center of the space.  Stacked neatly at the back, some golden spinewood crates sit next to an oversized iron-bound trunk that is incised with an array of silvery glyphs and symbols."
