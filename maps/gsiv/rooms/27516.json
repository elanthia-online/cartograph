    "The walls of the tent feel slightly more enclosed than to the south, where a larger collective of customers discusses the wares amongst one another.  Here, a handful of witch-balls provide lighting for the room, but from moment to moment cast what could be a montage of prophetic shadows with their flickering lights against the tent's silk walls.",
    "The walls of the tent close in on this area, creating a slightly more intimate feel.  A handful of witch-balls provide lighting for the room as a whole, though they occasionally cast elaborate shadows against the tent's silk walls.  Small pieces of yarn litter the ground in this area, and most ambient noise is somewhat muted.  The indigo mist has crept into this space as well, and writhes slowly along the ground in nearly invisible tendrils."
