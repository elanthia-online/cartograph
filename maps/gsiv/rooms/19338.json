    "[Warehouse, Makeshift Kitchen]"

  "description": [
    "More a large closet than a kitchen, this room is small and cramped.  An old pot-bellied cookstove splattered with grease rests in the corner, its tin pipe disappearing through a hole in the roof.  Dented cookware hangs from nails hammered into the exposed rafters above.  Crates, barrels, and boxes marked with illegible scrawl are stacked in every nook.  A scarred wooden table riddled with knife marks is littered with cracked pottery and other worn cooking utensils.  With its doors hanging open on bent hinges, an old wooden icebox drips water from the melting ice inside."
