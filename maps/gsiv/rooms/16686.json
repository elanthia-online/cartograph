    "This area of the building has been made to mock a scene at a relaxing beach.  Several layers of fine, white sand cover the floor, dotted with seashells and dried seaweed.  In the center of the room, an oversized red and white umbrella has been forced into the sand and is surrounded by sandcastles and tiny bright red crabs.  From the fishnet-covered walls protrudes a set of driftwood shelves, the only sign that there are items for sale."
