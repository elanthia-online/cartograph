  "description": [
    "Dark and reflective, the surrounding walls are covered in smooth ebony planks that have been secured with silver-headed nails.  A marble-topped iron stand with a small crystal bowl flanks one side of the entrance, and a pair of well-dressed mannequins have been situated in front of a tri-mirrored wall, giving the illusion of a much larger collection of display models.  Sheer black lace hangs over a doorway leading to the back of the shop."
