    "The room is dimly lit by a small glowing lantern on the back wall.  Filling the room and equally spaced apart is a soft black bed embroidered with a wand, a soft white bed embroidered with a rolton, a soft blue bed embroidered with a moon, and a soft red bed embroidered with a wagon.  Next to the arch leading to the first wagon are a small wooden nightstand with a few refreshments."
