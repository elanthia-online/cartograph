    "The scent of sweat and the occasional clash of metal upon metal is underscored by periodic thumps from the training mats.  The brightly lit room has been divided in half, the mats covering the stone floor on one side.  In the center of the padded area a target mannequin, the stuffing long ago beaten out of it, hangs limply off its post."
