    "A shimmering wall of heat emanates from red-hot coals in a circular stone pit, providing a deterrent to meddlesome observers.  On either side of the pit is a deep glaes trough filled with water and a mithril anvil.  Bent over the anvil, a dwarven smith works steadily - clearly the source of the ring of metal upon metal pounding rhythmically in your ears.  Tools, finished products, and a small keg of dwarven ale almost obscure the surface of a nearby workbench."
