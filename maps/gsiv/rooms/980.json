    "The roadway skirts a section of the forest, passing just to the southwest of the stand of pines and firs.  Several wooden cabins huddle under the protective branches of the trees.  Smoke wafts lazily from some of the chimneys, bringing the smells of burning pine and savory stew to your nostrils.  Neat, rock-lined paths lead to the front door of each house.  The area has a serene feel to it, and the wind is filtered to a soft breeze by the trees, although at times hard gusts blow through."
