    "Some type of tectonic or volcanic activity has formed this natural opening in the earth, a wide depression ending deep in the sticky sand of Caligos Isle.  The sinkhole is sloped and somewhat conical, albeit downward-facing in shape, with a smaller opening toward the center leading deeper into the ground.  Several petrified logs have been set out to display wares, while some sand has been formed into a mound in one corner, all serving as makeshift showcases for goods scavenged from around the island."
