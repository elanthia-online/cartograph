    "The slope of the lawn creates a natural depression around the postern gate, where a broad circle of paving stones is bordered by some square-trimmed boxwood bushes.  The cobblestone path divides the lush, green lawn, heading north toward a small, tranquil pond and southeast to the parade grounds.  The keep is festooned with brilliantly hued banners in crimson and gold, which hang near the top of the crenellated walls."
