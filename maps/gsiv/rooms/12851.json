    "Three large carts have been abandoned in the center of the alley and now serve as a playground for a number of merry children whose laughter echoes over the sound of hurried footsteps.  Roughly constructed stone houses are packed closely together along the sides of the way.  Another alley breaks off to the northeast.",
    "Roughly constructed stone houses are packed closely together along the sides of the way, while another alley breaks off to the northeast.  Three large carts, abandoned in the center of the alley, house a forgotten ball and doll, their owners long since retired to bed."
