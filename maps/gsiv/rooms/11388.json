    "Bolted firmly to a battlement is a small ballista crafted entirely of metal pointed downward and overlooking the western expanse surrounding the Citadel.  Set underneath the ballista is a rack filled with narrow metal arrows permanently fused together by a layer of thick red and brown rust.  The rust has flaked away, coating the surrounding ground, which is peppered with footprints from recent passersby."
