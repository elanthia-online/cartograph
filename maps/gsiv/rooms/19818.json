    "Arched niches trimmed in dark gold house the likenesses of the Lornon Arkati, each brought through in striking detail through black marble.  Ornate prayer mats line the floor beneath the every statue's cold and fixed stares.  Candles placed behind each stone depiction serve only to cast wavering shadows across the silent halls and highlight the statue's dark faces."
