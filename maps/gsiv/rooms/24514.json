  "description": [
    "The rectangular room, with its open expanse of alabaster floor and high pewter-gilded ceiling, is sparsely appointed -- a long and narrow table and a few chairs are the only pieces of furniture in the chamber.  The walls, however, are fully concealed by bookshelves, heavy under their burdens, and glass-fronted cases, filled to bursting with maps, charts and stacks of scrolls arranged into artful pyramids.  An arched opening along the western wall and an alabaster arch provide egress."
