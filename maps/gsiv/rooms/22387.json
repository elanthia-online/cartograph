  "description": [
    "Continuous beds of flora native to this area provide a frame to the lush garden.  A moss-laden wrought iron bench is positioned beneath the two largest trees, which grow on seperate corners of a small clearing.  Evidence of the garden's wildlife inhabitants is easily found, and a modwir bowl of birdseed is set to the side for feeding local birds.  A path of natural riverstones leads from here to the center of the garden."
