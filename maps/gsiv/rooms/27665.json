  "description": [
    "Western, northeastern, and southern corridors conjoin here at the edge of the quasi-circular second floor rotunda, the walls reinforcing the dome above with strategically constructed wide cedar logs.  A recently cleaned, sprawling blue-black rug bears the symbol of Clovertooth Hall.  In the light emanating from torches on the walls, a small sign on a shiny metal stand directs visitors wishing to conduct business with the mayor's office and bureaucratic wing to the west."
