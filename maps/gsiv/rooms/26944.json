    "Fine-grained and weathered granite blocks, ranging in size from small and flat rectangles to thick and large squares, form the walls and ceiling of the circular chamber.  Towering archways, five in total, are evenly spaced throughout, their hazy openings glowing with a dim light.  Five teardrop-shaped lanterns dangle from golden chains around a central, spiral staircase that ascends to the floor above."
