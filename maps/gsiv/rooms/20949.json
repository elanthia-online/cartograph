  "description": [
    "The hot, humid air hangs heavy over the fields of grasses and ferns.  The enclosed nature of the valley, bounded on one side by jungle highlands and on the other by foothills, results in a noticeable thickening of the island mist.  Combined, these factors create a wavy unreality atop the stepped terrain."
