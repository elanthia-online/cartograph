    "Cast in shadows and ostracized from its heartier brethren, the table in this corner of the pub shows signs of receiving more attention from a knife than from a polishing rag.  Bound with thin strips of barely useful iron and thoroughly soaked in spilled ale is a rickety construct that bears a vague resemblance to a chair."
