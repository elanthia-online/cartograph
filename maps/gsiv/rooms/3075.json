    "Tall banks of snow act as windbreaks for the houses huddling in their lee, encircling the small neighborhood.  A thick sheet of permafrost covers the daily-plowed roadway, making the surface more of a skating rink than a true street.  Children take advantage of it, running quickly down the hills, then sliding as far as they can down the ice."
