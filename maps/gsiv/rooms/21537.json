    "Brilliantly aglow with a dazzling array of lanterns, this area is spotless.  The east and west walls are lined with small tables topped with dressed dolls modeling a wide variety of miniature accessories.  A deep crimson rug edged with intricate gold threading flows in from the south, ending in a wide central aisle from which to browse the wares.  An ornately gilded mirror stands against the north wall, oddly out of place."
