    "Dangling from the ceiling on a silver link chain, a white marble moon with diminutive star-shaped cutouts spins lazily.  The warm light from a lit candle placed inside the spinning sphere creates tiny stars that twinkle across the wagon's dark wooden walls.  A glass display case rests against one wall, and a circular archway has been cut into the back of the wagon."
