    "Massive blocks of granite, toppled columns and shattered statues lie strewn about the landscape like the contents of a child's toy box emptied in a fit of temper.  Scattered down the side of the foothill to the south is a similar assortment of debris, remnants of the structures that once graced its terraced slopes.  A single tower remains at the top of the hill, a noticeably battered survivor of the city's battle with time."
