  "description": [
    "The Cholen Study is furnished in a palette of greys and black.  A large area rug woven in a medium shade of grey creates a neutral field on which sits a collection of black leather armchairs.  Tapestries cover the walls, their images rendered in muted black and white values.  The only color intruding upon the calm -- and solemn -- ambiance is a hanging chandelier with amber-toned glass globes."
