    "The steep walls of the ancient ravine cast deep shadows that block out the bright moonlight from far above.  The dark outlines of huge birds occasionally glide overhead, their shadows obliterating the distant stars as they pass.  Sharp fallen rocks and muddy patches of ground make the passage treacherous even to the surefooted."
