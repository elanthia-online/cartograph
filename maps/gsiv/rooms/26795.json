    "Steps mark the middle of the chamber, spiraling both upwards to a higher floor and downwards into darkness.  The round room itself is walled in stone, its floors covered in layered sapphire carpets and its entirety lit by glass globes suspended from filamentous silver chains.  An arched door leads outwards."
