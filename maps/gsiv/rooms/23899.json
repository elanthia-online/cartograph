    "The rough interior of the tree's trunk forms the walls of this hollowed out room, and the smooth wood floor is covered with a fine layer of scattered pine needles.  Along the walls some knots of all shapes and sizes have been left protruding and turned into makeshift pegs upon which the various wares hang.  A narrow passage leads further into the interior of the tree."
