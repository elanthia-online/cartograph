    "A bunk sits on one of the walls of this tiny cabin.  Across from it, a bench holds a number of tools, each stowed in its wooden partition, and kept company by stale tart crumbs.  The tools vary widely, with most being specific to shipboard repairs and maintenance.  Over the bench hangs an image of the Spitfire, made entirely from tiny pieces of inlaid wood.  Likely, the ship's carpenter is an artist as well."
