  "description": [
    "Small, sloping huts with roofing of mossy thatch dot either side of the stone roadway.  Light from unevenly spaced torches between them reveals decadent architecture, as if workers with an image of a home but no experience building one cobbled together a crude facsimile.  Incongruously, the doorless entrances of the huts reveal silken bedding strewn across the plank floors within, the colors riotous but the make uniformly fine."
