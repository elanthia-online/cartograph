    "Two lanterns flank the tunnel to the southeast, providing a bright light by which to see.  A keg of slightly fusty water sits in one corner, and a deep ladle hangs off the side of the barrel for ease of drinking.  Some thoughtful soul has left a tattered woolen blanket next to the water, in case someone needed a quick nap while on their smuggling run."
