    "Rose bushes fill the garden with pure whites, brilliant reds, golds, and blues as dark as night.  They are planted in geometric beds around the stone benches, which provide a place to sit and rest.  The bright blossoms of violet plants, beds of snapdragons and lilies, jasmine trees and other types of smaller flowers line the stone wall, and lilac bushes grow along the shaded bowers that extend off from the sunny garden.",
