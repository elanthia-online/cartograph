    "The gully comes to an end here, choked by a massive wall of vegetation.  An apple-green parrot with a crimson tail is perched on a forked branch, loudly proclaiming its presence to the entire forest.  A single beech tree, aloof yet gracious, holds court in a fawning stand of young oaks and maples.",
