  "description": [
    "The expansive hall is a beamed chamber with paneled walls, their polished wood peeking out from behind a wealth of tapestries hanging on all sides.  Groupings of chairs and stools sit in an array, overshadowed by a large, circular sofa occupying the room's center.  An imposing carved marble bust overlooks all, perched on the pedestal created by the plush sofa's crimson velvet back-cushions."
