    "[A Two-Story House, Entryway]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The muffled sounds of passersby trickle through the heavy metal-strapped door separating the entryway from the outside.  A thick bristly rug sits on the dark slate tile just inside the door as a token attempt to corral the mud and dirt from outside, and some polished brass coat hooks line one wall.  A wide crystal-paned door to the side leads into a dark-panelled room, and opposite it is a curving stairway.  Behind the stairway, the tantalizing smell of cooking wafts down a narrow hallway."
