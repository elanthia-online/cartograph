    "Paving stones from the village's streets continue up the gentle slope to the east, where a low stone wall surrounds a half-timber manor house and a small stone tower.  The manor house's windows have all been boarded over, and the roof is missing more shingles than are remaining.  The weather-greyed bulk of a stable can be glimpsed past the southern end of the house.  The flagstones stop at a rusted iron gate that pierces the stone wall's center."
