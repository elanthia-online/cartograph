    "A beam of light streams through a crooked lunette carved into a slanted modwir door, creating a large half-moon shape on the grey floor tiles.  The walls mimic the tilt of the entryway, creating the discomforting sensation of falling.  A silvery glow extends up from the stone stairs that lead down and further into the temple."
