    "This stall smells of old leather oil, brass polish and the scents of some type of animal unknown to you, possibly used as riding beasts by the ancients.  The skeleton of one of the beasts lies in the corner of the stall, making it clear that this was not a horse, but, what kind of creature it was remains very unclear."
