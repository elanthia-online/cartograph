  "description": [
    "Emerging from the forest floor is the uneven remains of a wide, cobbled road leading to the north.  Small bushes and tall grass grow from large cracks between the paving stones, while a majestic oak interrupts an entire section of the road; the work of an acorn between stones from centuries ago.  The surrounding trees of the forest continue to grow sparser in number, and the haunting sounds of the wood's inhabitants diminish in volume and occurrence."
