    "A lone stalactite has been painted with swirls of deep amethyst and streaks of sunny yellow-gold.  Elaborate feats of dwarven masonry stand on display out in front of an expansive storefront.  Idle chatter between shopkeepers, patrons, and neighbors runs together with the heavy footsteps of passersby.  Growing in the shadowed nooks of the tunnel are small clumps of softly glowing blue-green moss."
