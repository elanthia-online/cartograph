    "The broad sweep of the carpet-covered floor is interrupted by a brass dancing turtle statue.  Halfway to the steeply angled ceiling, a drawbridge painting hangs on one of the whitewashed stucco walls.  A clawfooted cherrywood table and a wide brass-handled cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
