    "This tall and sturdy bridge rises high above the currents of the Cairnfang delta.  From the top of the wide bridge, both Marshtown and the entire layout of Solhaven are clearly visible.  To the northwest, the bridge slopes down into Marshtown, kept afloat by barrels and planks.  To the southeast, Solhaven spreads out under the walls of Vornavis, a massive urban sprawl stretching from the walls to the shore."
