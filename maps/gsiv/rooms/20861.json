    "Dark silken tapestries shroud the walls of this circular room.  From them the eyes of Noi'sho'rah, Tahlad, and other great leaders of the Dhe'nar stare down on you in silent appraisal.  A massive black altar stands in the exact center of the room.  Dark candles burn in onyx sconces set at regular intervals around the room.  Extending six feet out from the altar lies a perfect circle of beaten copper, inset into the smooth floor."
