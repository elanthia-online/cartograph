    "Greyed by weather, the thick planks of the pier are roughly cut.  A trail has been worn smooth along the center of the pier, the surface sanded by the passing of many feet.  Clumps of water lilies float on the water's surface to either side of the pier, their fragrance filling the air with serenity."
