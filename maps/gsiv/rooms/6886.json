  "description": [
    "A lady of perhaps overly grand tastes had an obvious hand in decorating this bed chamber.  A riot of slightly tacky paintings and knick-knacks decorates mismatched but fine furnishings, and an ostentatious royal purple quilt covers the bed.  Sitting huddled in a back corner is a small, scratched nightstand with a man's personal effects placed on it.  Likely, it is the poor gent's last refuge in this far too feminine room."
