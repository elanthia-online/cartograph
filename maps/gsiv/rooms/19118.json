    "Built into the curve of the ship, the cabin is narrow and compact.   Fishing nets, filled with drying or dried flowers, are tied to the rafters, the fragrance of each bloom filling the air with a heady, cloying aroma that is almost overpowering.  Strapped to one wall, and carefully bound in place, is a bunk laden with heavy wool blankets, while underneath is a series of six metal buckets filled with tools."
