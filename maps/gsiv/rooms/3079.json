    "The harsh weather has given a creative individual the wonderful idea of creating a playground of ice and snow.  Hollowed out tubes create snakey slides whipping through the heart of the snowbank, while a plank leads up to an icy pirate ship.  Another icy spot creates a makeshift flat slide for children to skim across before careening into a fluffy embankment."
