  "description": [
    "A dense stand of tall willows creates a natural arch over the trail as it passes between their rough-barked boles.  As river breezes play through the branches hanging in graceful swags on either side, they sway in a nearly constant dance.  Birdsong is a constant background chorus to the soft rush of the river's current, the water masked by the willows but present in both sound and the rich loamy smell of its banks.",
    "A dense stand of tall willows creates a natural arch over the trail as it passes between their rough-barked boles.  As river breezes play through the branches hanging in graceful swags on either side, they sway in a nearly constant dance.  The songs of frogs is a constant background chorus to the soft rush of the river's current, the water masked by the willows and darkness, but present in both sound and the rich loamy smell of its banks."
