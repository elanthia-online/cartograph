    "This storage space is so packed with food that builders have added a wooden loft to hold the excess.  Cheese wheels, wine casks, salted meats, and barrels of vegetables would surely be enough to withstand a months-long siege, yet the freshness of the food suggests it's just the weekly supply.  Round wooden covers conceal a pair of brick-lined chambers dug into the frosty soil where perishables can be kept cold."
