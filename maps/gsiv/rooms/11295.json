    "The disarray here is just short of spectacular.  Reigning over the chaos, a large stained workbench strewn with shattered flasks, alembics, and bottles stands in the middle of the room.  The eastern wall has collapsed, cascading rubble and dust over every surface, and leaving large chunks of wood and stone lying about the floor.  Mixed into the mess are stirring rods, bits of glass, and metal, something that might have been a balance years ago, and a small brazier containing only soot."
