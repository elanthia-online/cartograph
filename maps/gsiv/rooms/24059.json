  "description": [
    "Ocean scenes paint the toy box-lined walls, each open box stuffed with toys like treasure chests sunk upon the bottom of a deep blue sea.  Several brightly colored cushions are scattered about the floor, while a lacquered rocking chair rests upon a sand-hued woven rug in one corner.  Multiple driftwood shelves hang upon the wall, flanking a scorched ship's wheel mounted in between.  Judging by the layers of dust along the toy boxes, the halfling-sized wooden rabbit on rockers is a bit newer."
