    "Brass handrails rise up along the edges of the bathhouse's stone rooftop, enclosing a wide flat surface that is mostly dominated by vivid flowerbeds, made even brighter by the sun's warm light.  The view from the garden is expansive, revealing the bustling streets of Wehnimer's Landing, the lush green wilds, and Darkstone Bay beyond."
