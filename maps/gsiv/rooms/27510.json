    "The room is haphazardly put together as this area primarily exists as a stockroom.  These walls are sturdier than those in the showroom due to large panels of riveted wood against the tent's frame.  Remnants of work lie everywhere on the floor from slabs of raw ores to small piles of metal shavings."
