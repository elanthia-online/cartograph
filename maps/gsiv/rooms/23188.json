  "description": [
    "Pristine blue-green water spills silently from the narrow trench into a sizeable stone-bordered hole, the final destination for the lake-sourced waterway.  Two black bear cubs lap thirstily from the pool while gnomes fill small buckets to take back to their homes, neither group disturbing the other at the hole.  A cluster of small dome-shaped dwellings, skillfully camouflaged with tree branches, leaves, and straw, blend with the natural surroundings such that they are nearly overlooked and unnoticed."
