    "Peace descends outside the gate, as the high walls of the city block most of the sound emanating from within.  Barely visible above the top of the crenellated wall are the windows and high turrets of BriarStone Keep, its lapis-tiled roofs glinting in the moonlight.  A small trail winds towards the mountainside.",
