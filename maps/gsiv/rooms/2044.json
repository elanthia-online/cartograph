    "The trail winds through a dense patch of heliconia flourishing in the moonlight at the forest's edge.  The plants raise large, elongated leaves like paddles plying the greenish luminescence.  Swarms of bats circle and dive overhead, feeding on an abundance of flying insects crowding the air above the heliconias' blooms.",

Swarms of hummingbirds continually circle the heliconias' brightly-colored flowers, their own iridescence rivaling that of the blooms."
