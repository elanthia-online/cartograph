    "The cobblestone road narrows somewhat as it continues its long winding trek through the heart of the forest.  Off to the northeast a ruined cottage, nestled in a grove of trees, sits silently unused for an untold number of years.  The underbrush of the grove now grows up along the structure itself, making it difficult to identify as a building at all."
