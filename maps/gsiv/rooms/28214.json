    "This portion of the enclosure is wide, though not particularly deep.  The back half of the space is covered in a rough sand and dirt mixture, and a variety of different sedimentary rocks are interspersed throughout it.  Here are there, however, exhibits are visible, each seamlessly integrated into the scenery.  A brass plaque is stationed directly in front of the exhibits."
