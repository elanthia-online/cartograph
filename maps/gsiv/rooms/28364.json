  "description": [
    "Deeply polished ebonwood walls and thick black carpeting offset a gleaming silver canopy bed with sheer black silk sheets.  Draped across the bed's frame are lengths of sheer black spidersilk, the ends of which are knotted off in intricately fringed patterns.  An ebonwood table placed at the foot of the bed holds two flickering candles that cast shadows across the walls and provide light sparingly, barely illuminating the painting that faces the bed, while an ebonwood bench rests against one wall."
