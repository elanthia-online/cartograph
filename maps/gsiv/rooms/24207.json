    "The inside of the shop is no different from the outside.  It is rather run down and doesn't appear to be too safe.  It does, however, look like an active shop.  While there is a generous layer of dust on the ground, there are what appear to be impressions of fresh foot traffic.  Some dusty faewood shelves line the back wall, and in the far corner along the same wall there is a small sturdy steel table.  A large wooden sign is set on the wall between the shelves and the table for all to see."
