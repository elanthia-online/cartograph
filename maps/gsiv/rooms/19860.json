    "Expansive, rigidly perpendicular, and made of creamy white limestone, the entryway hints at quiet meditation and cool contemplation farther to the interior.  A double staircase, its steps centered between the three arches leading to the rest of the building, joins to itself in a landing rimmed with a golden baluster to the front.  Two wide, carved doors of white pine leading to the outside have been limned with golden paint to pick out the details."
