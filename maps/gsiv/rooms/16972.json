    "A triad of pale orbs hover in mid-air, their interiors awash in a rippling silver glow as they whisk back and forth, conjuring forth an ever-renewing mist which swirls with a life of its own toward the west.  Soft hums echo from each of the orbs' surfaces, each distinct melody flowing into one another to form a haunting melody that hangs over the area like a thick fog."
