    "The greyish stone of the ceiling above resembles a honeycomb of tiny holes and curving channels, its wavy natural patterns carved by ages of trickling moisture.  The air is dank and moist, and small puddles collect in shallow depressions in the floor, casting a faint whitish mist up from their surface."
