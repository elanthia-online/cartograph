    "Surrounded by earthen walls, this secret underground room smells of dirt and moisture, the air laden with dust and miniscule falling particles.  The only furnishings consist of a low bench and a large wooden chest with a broken lock.   Several candelabra have been stuck in the dirt walls, the candles casting their dancing light on the room, not quite eliminating the shadows at the edges.  Several wooden boards are set into one wall, creating a ladder of sorts."
