    "A thick blanket of fog nearly obscures the path downhill to the east and blurs the edges of the large homes that stand sentinel at the base of Tower Hill.  The path curves northwest as it ascends the hill and is studded with small mottled stones.  Larger stones and boulders dot the grassy hillside, barely visible through the shadows within the dense thicket of briars that darkens the steep western slope.",
