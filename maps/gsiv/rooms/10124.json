  "description": [
    "Two lines of stately yew trees flank a broad cobblestone road.  The yews are ancient, covered in dense growth all the way from nearly ground level to the top of their soaring trunks.  The growth is thick enough that it barely allows any glimpse of the land beyond.  Beside the path, a swiftly running stream sends a spray of mist up to accompany the dissonant sound of rushing water.  To the north a large clearing is visible.",
    "Two lines of stately yew trees crowd in on a dark cobblestone road.  The yews are ancient, covered in dense growth all the way from nearly ground level to the top of their soaring trunks.  The growth is thick enough that it allows no outside light through the branches.  To the north a large clearing is illuminated by the silvery starlight."
