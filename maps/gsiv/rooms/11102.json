  "description": [
    "This is the cabin of the first officer of the Krolvin ship.  Despite the importance of this position, the ship's design affords him little luxury.  A small desk and a bed are the only items of furniture here, while the walls are adorned with nothing but an empty ornamental sheath, which is firmly attached to the bulkhead."
