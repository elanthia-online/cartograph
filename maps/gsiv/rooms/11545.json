    "The wind off Maelstrom Bay blows black gritty sand up from the narrow beach below.  The thick razor grass waves in the wind, swaying like spear tips of warriors on the march.  A bit of water has gathered in the depression left by some footprints in a soft patch of marshy soil beside the trail."
