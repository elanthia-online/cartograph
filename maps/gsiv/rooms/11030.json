    "Towards the southern end of the path, the forest appears to thin a bit, the trees no longer a solid wall.  A courtyard lies just beyond the edge of the path, hints of a large building visible beyond the tangle of vegetation surrounding the trail.  A few figures roam about the clearing, most of them in robes."
