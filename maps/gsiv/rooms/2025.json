    "On the moonlit beach, breakers rush in, rising into huge walls of water before yielding to the backwash of the previous wave.  The beach stretches away in a lazy crescent, the dark tangle of roots along its inland side like a complex froth of lace.  At the northern edge, the sand is halted by the impervious stand of Greymist's shadowy vegetation.",
    "Gulls wheel overhead, casting fleet shadows down on the sand beach below.  Breakers rush in, rising into huge walls of water before yielding to the backwash of the previous wave.  The beach stretches away in a lazy crescent, the tangle of roots along its inland side like a complex froth of lace.  At the northern edge, the sand is halted by the impervious stand of Greymist's dense vegetation."
