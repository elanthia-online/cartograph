    "On the moonlit beach, breakers rush in, rising into huge walls of water before yielding to the backwash of the previous wave.  The beach stretches away in a lazy crescent, the dark tangle of roots along its inland side like a complex froth of lace.  At the northern edge, the sand is halted by the impervious stand of Greymist's shadowy vegetation.",

The beach stretches away in a lazy crescent, the tangle of roots along its inland side like a complex froth of lace.  At the northern edge, the sand is halted by the impervious stand of Greymist's dense vegetation."
