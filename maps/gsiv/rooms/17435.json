    "Backpacks, sacks and cloaks are folded neatly onto shelves behind the counter.  A few flasks filled with colored liquid decorate the crossbeams overhead.  Flickering candles add a little light to the otherwise dim, windowless room.  Heat billows in from the wood burning stove in the foyer to the east."
