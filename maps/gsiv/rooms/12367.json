    "Running almost a third of the length of the ship, this castle deck wears the same crenellated bulwarks and maroon glaes trim as the fo'csle castle deck. The ship's wheel stands aft of the mizzen mast and forward of the bonaventure mast, where the helmsman can keep an eye on the ship's main sails and any shifts in the wind.  From here the aftcastle ladder leads down to the upper deck."
