  "description": [
    "The well-lit tent has several crooked columns of cauldrons that are likely supporting the dark blue canvas walls and ceiling.  A small opening leads to a separate room toward the rear.  To the immediate right of the entrance is a small, neatly arranged area with a large rack, a display table, and a wicker basket.  A mithril placard loosely attached to the wall also stands out."
