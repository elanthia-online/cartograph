    "A meager trail winds through the huge boles of black-barked trees.  Some of the giants have a circumference so large, they would dwarf a mammoth.  However, such a beast could never penetrate the impossibly thick growth.  The trees stand side to side with trunks almost touching, while overhead the boughs intertwine in an impenetrable ceiling of black foliage."
