    "The view of the night sea appears somewhat calm from this vantage point, with a small protected harbor just below.  Upon its dark and glassy surface, tiny lights come into view with each lifting of the indigo fog.  Bobbing up and down with the incoming waves, they are swallowed back into obscurity as the fog descends yet again.",
    "The view of the western sea appears somewhat calm from this vantage point, with a small protected harbor just below.  Upon its deep blue, glassy surface, small fishing vessels come into view with each lifting of the indigo fog.  Bobbing up and down with the incoming waves, they are swallowed back into obscurity as the fog descends yet again."
