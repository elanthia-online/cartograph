    "Colonies of stiptic fungus populate the otherwise dark space, their luminescence the only source of illumination.  Cramped and narrow, the damp earth all around seems to press inward in an inconsiderate manner, its capacious stalactites and stalagmites creating considerable barriers to movement.  Further frustrating the outlook for any appreciable forward or backward progress, there doesn't appear to be any obvious means of egress, save for up a slide-like slope that is far too steep and slick to climb."
