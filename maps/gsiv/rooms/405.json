    "This is the large front room of the furrier's shop.  Roughly hewn planks, supported by wooden barrels, span the space and serve as a counter.  Behind it presides Dakris the Furrier, purveyor of rare furs and hides.  A few simple chairs are randomly scattered along the dirt floor.  Across the room, to the southeast, you see a doorway covered only by a draped velnalin hide.",
