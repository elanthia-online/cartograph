    "A yellowed troll skull sits upon the tip of a tall spear, its eyeless sockets staring hopelessly outward.  A pile of worn armor is stacked at its base, nothing more than frozen rags now.  The bitter, unrelenting cold gives no quarter as it seeps across the plain, seeking to clutch all within its chill embrace."
