    "Displayed here are accessories for those traveling out and about in the snowy clime.  A young apprentice bustles about, straightening the drape of a cloth and dusting away signs of the recent renovations.",
    "A row of raised wooden cases display cold weather accessories, each overflowing with assorted wares.  The walls are lined with animal fur rugs, suspended from thick iron rods hanging from the ceiling.  A small sign sits atop a podium nestled against the wall.  A young shop apprentice bustles about, seeing to the stock of the shop.",
    "A row of wooden pegs lines one oak-paneled wall, displaying thick, colorful caps and scarves.  The remaining three walls are covered in rich tapestries suspended from thick mithril rods that hang from the ceiling and embroidered with scenes of local wildlife.  The floor is covered with a lush, white rug made to resemble snow.  A long, glass case that holds a variety of mittens and gloves occupies one corner of the shop.  A young sylvan apprentice tidies the shawls on a nearby wooden rack."
