  "description": [
    "This chamber has been formed by a huge air bubble trapped inside of gleaming black volcanic glass.  Two lifelike statues of black ora tower against the far wall, one slightly smaller than the other.  You can hear muffled sounds coming from a hallway to the north and there is a ghastly red light glowing from the south."
