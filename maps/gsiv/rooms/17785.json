    "A large, circular depression has been dug in the center of the room, white sand piled upon its banks.  Two sarsen pillars stand at a break in the sand.  Steps lead down between them into the depression where a solid marble podium stands.  Surrounding the podium is a double ring of cut bluestone benches which provide seating for assemblies."
