  "description": [
    "Away from the rumble of the cascading waterfall, a thin rocky ledge follows the eastern wall of the great cavern, its edge overlooking the vast darkness of the pit below.  Moist with clinging water vapor, the uneven walls of the cavern provide few safe handholds for cautious travelers attempting to reach its nether side.  Nearby, a tunnel branches off to the south."
