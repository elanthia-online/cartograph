    "A cluster of massive trees casts a dense shadow over this part of the forest, their gnarled roots protruding from the ground and creating a tangled maze which encroaches on a forgotten stone structure.  From between the roots and trunks of these behemoths, a single empty window glares out over a vine-covered stone wall.  Nearby stands a lone stone column, its height nearly overcome by vines and broad, verdant leaves."
