  "description": [
    "The acute slant of the deck makes for treacherous footing in the dark and narrow passageway.  The smell of stale sweat and harsh soap combine to form a rank, noxious stink.  On each side of the passageway is a wide, iron-reinforced door.  A steep companionway leads up and down."
