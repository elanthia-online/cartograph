    "Fine gravel crunches underfoot, leaving faint footprints in the neatly raked path that wanders alongside the Mistydeep River.  Mature oaks and maorals dot the riverbank, while inland is a grassy sward, dotted with tiny white and yellow flowers.  As the trail winds northward, it leads upwards into a stand of trees."
