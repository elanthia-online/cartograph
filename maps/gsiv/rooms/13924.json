  "description": [
    "Woven mats of patterned cotton are scattered across the floor between crates and cases of fishing gear on display, creating a soft covering that still shows off the wood beneath.  A chandelier-style lamp with a trio of frosted glaes orbs is suspended from a thick faenor chain above the polished linden counter in the center of the room.  Tall wicker barrels filled with a wide variety of rods are tucked between two large arched windows that allow the cool river breeze to circulate throughout the shop."
