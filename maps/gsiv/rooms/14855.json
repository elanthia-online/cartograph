    "A moonlit trail winds through mounds of wild flowers competing with the lush grasses inhabiting the meadow.  To the west, the dark silhouettes of poplar trees offer a lighter contrast to the denser shadows of a forested hillside behind them, and, to the south, the darkness of a lake offers a fond, reflective surface to the moons above.  A single stone stele stands tall among the grasses, its sides rich with carved symbols.",

To the west, the pastel green tones of poplar trees offer a lush contrast to the darker greens of a forested hillside behind them, and, to the south, the crystalline blue hues of a lake sweep the palette into refreshing, cooler tones.  A single stone stele stands tall among the flowers, its sides rich with carved symbols."
