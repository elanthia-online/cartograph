  "description": [
    "Descending deep into the mountain, a narrow walkway winds steeply through a curtain of liquid-sheened rock.  The colors vary as the rock reaches deeper into the abyss, starting with a vivid crimson rock that is nearly black in the dim light.  Striations of a duskier wine-dark purple writhe across the rock wall as it works its way down into the depths.  Uncertain light, given by flickering torches set into the walls illuminates the room only partially."
