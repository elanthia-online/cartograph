    "The mouth of the stairway opens into a cavernous space hollowed out from the mountain, with deep crags and scars still visible in the stone.  Heavy iron sconces are bracketed to walls stained by soot and mildew, and the floor underfoot is a ridged span of age-darkened teak.  The chasmal void beyond is dimly lit by lanterns hung overhead, and the forms of stools and a bar sulk like lurking shadow beasts in the distance."
