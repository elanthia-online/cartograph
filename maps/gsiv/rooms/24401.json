    "The pavilion is open to the elements on the north and east sides, its arched entryways half-covered by flowering bushes and vines that grow into the interior, spreading across the rough panelled walls and winding around the heavy ceiling beams.  Wooden tables and benches are arranged in semicircles in a central meeting area, and a bar and serving table can be glimpsed through a shaded niche in the south wall."
