    "Mounds have been made in this area, obviously not natural, yet blending in with the surroundings.  A dark stone walkway snakes along the rise, leading to a cavern hollowed out of the largest of the hills.  A white chalk crown is traced on the mound's side, large enough to be visible from every vantage within the bailey.  Below the mound, the grassy expanse of the bailey spreads out in verdant glory."
