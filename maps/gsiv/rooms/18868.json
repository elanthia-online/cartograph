    "The crystalline walls of this spherical chamber glow softly with a subtle radiance, and a hint of perfume permeates the air.  Fresh black orchids are strewn across the floor and around a hot tub set off behind a spidersilk screen.  The mistress's eclectic interests become apparent as you survey the room - sumptuous gowns, leather pants, ancient tomes, and numerous objects d'art.  Nestled among comfortable cushions scattered about the room are a magnificent orb and a lustrous thanot box."
