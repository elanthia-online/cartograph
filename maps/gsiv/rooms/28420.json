  "description": [
    "Dust and dried bits of mud nearly cover the entire floor, with only the immediate area surrounding a pair of stone mannequins clear of debris.  Hung just above a crudely carved table displaying a variety of cracked and broken clay pots is a stretched rawhide painting of a giant spear-stuck rolton.  A carved soapstone lantern flickers occasionally, casting dancing shadows throughout the room."
