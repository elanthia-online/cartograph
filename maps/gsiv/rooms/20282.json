    "Bent boughs of large cypress trees tower overhead, providing a shaded clearing.  The grove is enclosed on three sides by the massive rooty knots of the cypress trees that form the natural boundries of the area.  Liana vines drape the oak pavilion and wrap around the white birch arch leading back in to the structure.  A soft carpet of moss covers the ground, interspersed with patches of pale blue fungus."
