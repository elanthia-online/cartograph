    "The flickering fire in the next room can be seen dancing on the far wall of this room.  A cloth curtain in the doorway is easily pulled to prevent any disturbances while the occupants sleep.  Two beds are set along the far wall along with two dressers along the adjoining wall.  Each has strange markings that you seem to recall seeing elsewhere."
