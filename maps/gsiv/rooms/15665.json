    "Walls of dark granite paneled with a deep green wood encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a twisting serpent hangs along one wall, opposite a hearth filled with twisting, shimmering flames.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the sweet scent of wild flowers rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its green linen snugly tucked."
