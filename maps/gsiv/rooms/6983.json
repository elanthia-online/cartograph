    "You stand at the top of an ancient stairway, carved into the natural rock by a long forgotten hand in another age.  Although wet and moss-covered like the canyon walls, it is quite wide and seems safe enough to travel.  The stairs lead down to a ledge of rock which juts out from the side of the cliff just above the shallow waters of the once violently raging river.  A narrow path also leads around the rocks beside you, at the rim of the gorge."
