    "Curtains as red as rose petals, darkened by the oppressive damp, swathe the walls of the circular chamber in a display of moldering majesty.  The velvet draperies cannot muffle the sounds of trickling water from without, or hide glimpses of a rope leading up out of the depths.  They do, however, funnel and enhance the haunting whispers rising from a basin of green liquid at the chamber's center. Silver patterns are etched into the granite floor, spreading outward from the pool in concentric spirals."
