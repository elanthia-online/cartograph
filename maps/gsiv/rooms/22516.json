    "Faded blue silks hang loosely from gauze-ribboned brass poles, creating a makeshift room.  Tiny cloud-shaped enamel candleholders strung from the ceiling, playing off a sun-shaped mirror sitting upon a serpentine front dark walnut vanity in the center of the room, have been molded into various shapes to form the illusion of a summer sky.  Tucked in a corner, a collection of round boxes has been stacked haphazardly around a large oxidized steel wheel.  Softly chiming with the barest hint of provocation, a curtain of gear-strung chains flanked by twin dark burnt velvet settees leads back to the other room."
