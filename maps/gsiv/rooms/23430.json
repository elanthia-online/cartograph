    "Layers of tattered ecru lace stretch across the walls of the room, barely covering the barnacle-encrusted planks composing the ship's frame.  The room is dominated by a bas-relief powder blue cabinet and a lacquered lavender dresser, each flanking a carved mahogany figurehead.  The mermaid maiden's arms are outstretched towards the ceiling, serving as makeshift racks for merchandise.  Woven mats of crisp sea grass lead north into another area, the room obscured by a curtain of twine and dried kelp."
