    "A collection of highly polished shields hangs on the wall beside this table, reflecting the table and its occupants in a softly rounded way.  A thick candle with three lit wicks appears to burn all the brighter for being reflected in the burnished surfaces of so many shields.  A pair of identical thraks are painted on the table."
