    "Two large windows, spanning from floor to ceiling, flank the double-wide entry that dominates the southern wall.  An enormous semi-circular rosewood and teak desk is positioned at the apex of both northeastern and western corridors, as well as the foyer.  Frosted glass globes dangle at even intervals to create ample illumination for the library's visitors, and create shadows along the very distant ceiling."
