    "A framed Ta'Illistim map hangs on one of the smooth sandstone walls, and a cerulean cloud-painted ceiling rises overhead.  A small potted boxwood shrub sits in one corner of a patterned hardwood floor.  There is a heavy lead glass display case on one side of the shop and a narrow glass-topped table on the other."
