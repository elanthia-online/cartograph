    "This room is dark save for what little light manages to flicker forth from an oil lantern hanging from the ceiling.  The glass is sooty and almost completely obscured by dust and cobwebs, casting strange shadows on the walls.  Grimy dressers and wardrobes clutter the edges of the room, their contents open to the air.  A plank from the floor sits askew, allowing a draft to seep up from below through the hole, and the black door leading out is tilted off its hinges."
