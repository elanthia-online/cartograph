  "description": [
    "The wintry winds are unable to invade this narrow chute.  Formed by a fracture in the slope, it slices vertically through the basalt, a deep scar marring the mountain.  To either side, dark rock walls constrict the narrow space available.  An outcropping looms overhead, capping the upper end of the chute."
