    "Dark wood panels the walls of this underground chamber.  Sturdy oak beams gracefully sweep downward from the vaulted ceiling, separating the myriad of bookcases along the walls.  A short desk and two squat chairs are the only other adornments in the room.  Several glowing orbs float just above the desk, providing ample light. A single hatch leads out."
