    "Small saplings struggle in the shadows of the tall, dark trees to find the light of life in which to grow.  Small paths between the trees are mushy with the decay of leaves, branches and unseen death.  The lonely sound of an owl hooting in the distance breaks the monotony of silence.",
    "Small saplings struggle in the shadows of the tall, dark trees to find the light of life in which to grow.  The forest floor is soft with the decay of leaves, branches and unseen death.  Tendrils of ivy climb the trunks of many of the trees, threatening to choke the life out of them."
