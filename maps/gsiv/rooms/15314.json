    "A blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the smooth granite walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A multicolored giant toy rolton sits in one corner of a speckled black marble floor.  There is a gilded maple cabinet on one side of the shop and a vine-carved mahogany table on the other."
