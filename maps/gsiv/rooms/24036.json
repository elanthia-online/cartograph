    "Crimson and gold streamers wind around the limestone columns of the easternmost portion of the coliseum.  A square of pure black marble, centered with a golden crown, has been inset into the white marble flooring.  Lush crimson tapestries flank a gem-adorned vaalorn door, over which hangs a wide banner."
