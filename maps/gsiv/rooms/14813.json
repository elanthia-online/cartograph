    "Crates and barrels are stacked along the end of the pier, waiting to be moved to the barges docked along the pilings.  Fishing nets ornamented with colorful floats have been strung up to dry in the fresh air, and a collection of anchors and driftwood decorates the row of homes built along the pierside with a nautical theme."
