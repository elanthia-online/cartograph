    "A small creek runs through the area, leaving banks of muck that have collected over the years. Various bits of debris and rubble fill the banks.  Two wooden gravemarkers have rotted completely, one of which has collapsed into the running water.  Under the surface of the channel rests a footstone.",
    "A small creek runs through the area, leaving banks of muck that have collected over the years.  A number of spiny crayfish can be seen in the shallow water.  Under the shade of a stately black willow, two wooden gravemarkers have rotted completely, one of which has collapsed into the running water.  Under the surface of the channel rests a footstone."
