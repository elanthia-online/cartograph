    "Squirrels cavort among the pines, leaping from branches to scurry down the needle-carpeted hillside.  The trail curves along the slope through patches of sunlight and shadow, past cabins and small houses arranged between the trees.  A faint whiff of sea breeze joins the scent of the pines, and the blue waters of the bay can be seen in the distance past the merchant road."
