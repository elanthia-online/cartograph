    "Gnarled, twisted trees loom menacingly, their bark a sickly grayish brown.  The huge trunks and spreading branches cut off all moonlight from above, and phosphorescent toadstools softly illuminate the forest floor with golden and emerald light.  The air hangs heavy with the humidity and lack of circulation.  Even without the breeze, a rancid scent of sulfur is apparent.",
