    "Recessed niches provide a space for nearly each of the Lesser Spirits, those of light upon one wall, and those of darkness on the other.  Massive marble columns topped with golden capitals line the hallway, ornate velvet banners of white and black hung between them.  Prayer mats are arranged in a comfortable grouping around the base of each niche, the gaze of the large and expertly-chiseled statues directed at those who come to pray."
