    "Amidst the humidity, sunlight streams down here due to a partial break overhead in foliage.  The golden light lends extra warmth to the path where the mud is almost entirely dried up into caked dirt.  In one direction, the path leads directly to one of several open-faced huts, while footprints lead to a larger clearing on the other side."
