    "Dark mahogany wainscoting and white plaster walls encompass the main compartment of the wagon, the intricately carved border of each lacquered panel meticulous and exact.  Opposite a nacre-inlaid roll top desk situated beneath a large paned window, a tall bookshelf with elegantly scrolled feet stands guard over the well-appointed room.  Arranged in a loose semi-circle on an oval silk rug between the matched bookcase and desk, a quartet of velvet wingback chairs afford ample seating.  Centered along a short wall across from the entrance, a narrow etched glass door leads further into the shop."
