    "The view to the east is blocked by the sturdy height of the corner tower, which is distinguished only by a window high above the wall.  Atop the tower, flags fly to signify the militia's occupation of the structure.  To the south, the streets of Temple Burrow twist and turn around the great temple, which stands like a beacon of hope and fear to the faithful of every denomination."
