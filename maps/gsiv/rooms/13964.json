  "description": [
    "This part of the patio overlooks the river below and is covered by a latticed wooden shade.  Large potted plants sit near the supports, planted with climbing vines of honeysuckle that grow upward covering most of the shade.  A sturdy vaalin railing has been erected, allowing a breathtaking vantage of the river and the countryside below.  A small wrought-iron and wooden bench rests against the back of the building, partially covering a fresco that has been painted on the wall."
