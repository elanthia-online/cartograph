    "Small, unrecognizable creatures scurry underfoot, retreating startled to the shadows to glare out with beady eyes.  Several torches shed an eerie, pale blue light over the roughly carved obsidian walls.  A crude table and benches are set in one corner of the room, opposite the passageway leading out of the cavern.  Set off to the side is a small alcove, almost invisible in the deep shadows."
