  "description": [
    "The symmetry of the long aisle flanked by columns shifts as it veers to the northeast.   The high, inset windows stop as the hallway's curve is initiated, however, reflected light from the frozen mountain of ice shines in through the spaces between the interior columns, illuminating the colors of frescos decorating the exterior walls.  An alcove can be glimpsed to the northeast."
