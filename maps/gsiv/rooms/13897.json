    "Quieter than its neighbor to the west, the pub is filled with comfortable oak tables and chairs.  Muted moonlight from a large leaded glass window on the north wall highlights the gleam of polished oak flooring.  Deep green, plastered walls provide a backdrop for several murals depicting life in a country village.  A large fireplace on the western wall promises warmth on the chilliest of winter nights.",
