    "Bustling with activity, the kitchen is a display of ordered chaos.  Bakers linger around counters, taking turns kneading dough and checking the brick ovens that pigeon-hole the northern wall.  Arch cooking fires housing roasting meats stand under the attention of chefs, who turn the meats evenly, while also ensuring that nearby cauldrons retain their warmth.  An enormous serving counter houses the various dishes and drinks that are being prepared for waiting customers."
