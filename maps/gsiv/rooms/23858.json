  "description": [
    "Platforms at varying heights reside in the branches of the great banyan tree, their surfaces well worn with years of travel.  The branches continue upward toward the thick, leafy canopy, their leaves blocking out the moonlight.  A series of small glowing blue globes illuminate the area with an eerie light.  Several liana vines dangle down from the higher platforms, adding their sweet floral scents to the air.  Twin rope bridges extend in two directions, offering passage to the west and northwest.",
