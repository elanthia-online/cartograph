    "Fallen leaves from overhanging oak branches and greyish-green moss border the edges of the faint path running through the woods.  Probably a passage meant for use by small woodland rodents or swine, the run is little more than a twisting line of trampled undergrowth, nearly invisible among the thick ferns and shrubs of the forest floor.",
