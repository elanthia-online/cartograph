    "Elegantly carved marble statues, each depicting a human woman bearing a torch, flank the archway to the northeast.  A tattered purple and gold banner droops down from the ceiling above, dangling from the one support hook that has yet to give.  The remains of several chairs and a small couch, long since surrendering to time and neglect, rest at the base of the northern wall.  A heavy wooden door is propped open to the south."
