    "Along the back wall, steam pours out from enormous pots cooking over a fire within a stone hearth.  Long handled forks, ladles, and other cooking implements are spread out on a low wooden counter.  Dangling from the side of a chopping stand are nets of potatoes, carrots, and turnips.  The small pail of water used for washing the vegetables has been placed beneath them.  Two doors are on opposite sides of the kitchen, one leads to the pantry and the other to the storage room.",
