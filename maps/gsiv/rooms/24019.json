    "[Inner Walkway, Hatchet Throw]"

  "description": [
    "Irregular flagstones have been fitted to seamless perfection, forming a wide walkway leading from the east, which branches into two smaller paths.  A snooty Vaalorian woodsman stands near a wooden plank with a small vaalorn hatchet embedded in the surface forms a simple counter resting in the perpetual shade of the limestone coliseum.  A large circular piece of tree has been painted with several rings of varying colors and propped on a sturdy stand some distance away."
