    "Blackened walls visibly wet with a strange fluid stretch in a full circle from the entrance of the shop.  Thick, tentacle-like appendages are hung from each like a curtain over each of the tunnels leading deeper into the temple.  Much like the walls, the floors are squishy and sticky with small sanguine colored pools strewn about.  A pair of black candles illuminate a rusted iron table in the center."
