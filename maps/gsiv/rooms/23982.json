    "On the back wall of this modestly sized room, a teak platform is affixed to the wall and outfitted with a variety of bedding materials to create a small, but cozy sleeping space accessible only by the nearby wall-mounted ladder.  Beneath, a desk is tucked into the niche and is covered by a gold-flecked brown leather blotter, with a blood eagle feather quill and inkwell stationed just above.  On the opposite wall are a gold brocade-cushioned chair with a high back and a glass-topped pedestal table."
