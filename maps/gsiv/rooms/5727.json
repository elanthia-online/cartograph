    "The walkway turns abruptly southeast from here, while striking due west toward a large hill.  The buildings here sport signs reading \"Jag Hill\" and have shining steel numbers attached.  This section of town seems very well kept when compared with the rest of the sprawl.  A dark, narrow alley leads due south between two taller buildings.  Denuded of its mane by the elements, the skin of a cragviper is stretched on a tanning frame that hangs above a doorway just inside the alley.",
    "The odor of rotting flesh is less pervasive here, as scents of toxic rendering concoctions take over.  The strength of the noxious fumes keeps the flies and insects away from this small, enclosed yard.  Large chunks of meat dangle along the rough-hewn fence facing south, and small gibbets of coagulated blood speckle the ground below.  Near the door to the shop stands a small canopy, under which a few shelves of wares are displayed.",
