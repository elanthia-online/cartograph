    "Strategically placed furnishings are paired with unusual light sources within this wide tent, and are used to create a room that is cast half in shadow and half in light.  Polished white birch trunks stand open upon the eastern wall beneath the steady glow of hundreds of tiny votives, while the western side is furnished with ebonwood armoires and low benches that are illuminated by the dim red glow of frosted orbs.  A long cloth-covered table rests in the divide between sides, its surface splashed with an equal measure of shadows and light"
