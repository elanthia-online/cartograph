    "Velvet-covered divans and settees rest comfortably against the white stucco walls, leaving the golden linden dance floor free of clutter.  Heavy draperies decorate the double archway that leads into the foyer, as well as the long expanse of a raised oak stage.  Frosted glass globes fitted with tiny candles dangle from the vaulted ceiling to lend the room soft illumination."
