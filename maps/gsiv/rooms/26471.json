    "Large blocks of cut stone form the walls of this sizeable structure, their surfaces bearing the faint chisel-marks of recent attempts to remove every trace of enveloping coral.  Even the slate floorstones show signs of being newly renovated, with traces of fine white powder still evident in the deeper cracks and crevices.  Lit by several brass lanterns, the shop's wrought iron table and shelves look newly made and their placement almost arbitrary, while the back wall has been given over to a set of wrought iron hooks and a small brass display stand",
