  "description": [
    "Large limestone columns flank the entrance to this grand venue, and rows of identical pillars march off in either direction to form a colonnade.  Inset into the smooth, perfectly polished white marble flooring is the crest of House Ta'Vaalor in opposing black marble.  Off to one side, a torch-lit limestone passage leads deep below the coliseum.  A crimson pennon hangs above a massive iron gate that leads into the main combat arena."
