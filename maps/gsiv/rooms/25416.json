    "A number of tables and chairs are set against the walls of the hall, waiting the next meal or well attended meeting.  At the end of the hallway is a wide stairwell with two Imperial soldiers standing sentry at its base.  Hendoran military banners decorate the stone walls along with flags of defeated enemies, a ragged Nalfein banner among them."
