    "A series of marble steps wrap around the neighborhood baths, leading up to a colonnade of ionic columns that are in turn capped by a polished granite low pitched roof.  The construction of the baths at the thermal mud baths was quite an event, a gigantic boulder carved out by hand and dedicated by a throng of locals and visitors."
