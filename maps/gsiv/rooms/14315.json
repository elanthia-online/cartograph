    "Blue-grey smoke fills the room to the rafters, making what little illumination that exists appear soft and hazy.  Heavy indigo velvet curtains are pulled tightly together and a small hearth glows with sanguine embers, yet fails to throw off any heat into the room.  Set along the back wall in the shadows is a counter that matches the other dark furnishings in the room, blending altogether in a seamless caliginosity.  Small groupings of tables and chairs are scattered at a discreet distance from each other."
