    "[Lighthouse Table]"

  "description": [
    "The stout central pillar supporting this table has been fashioned into a likeness of the Isle's lighthouse.  Its details are painstakingly recreated in miniature, down to the Four Winds emblem on the door.  The parapet has been greatly enlarged to provide the surface for the table, the tiny wooden railing around the edges interfering little with the use of it.  A single candle rests at the center of the table in a cut-glass holder shaped like the lighthouse beacon."
