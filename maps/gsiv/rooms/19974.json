    "A glass wall divides the room in half, protecting the exhibit from the patrons passing by, but affording them an optimal view of the lush grasslands and its creatures spread out behind the glass.  On this side of the divider, several more animal specimens are displayed on individual pedestals, their countenances forever frozen in death.  The soft sound of bleating emanates from nearby at random intervals, its pitch changing each time it is heard."
