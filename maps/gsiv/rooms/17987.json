    "Although the roof tiles look disordered and broken a meticulous inspection shows them to be carefully arranged to give the appearance of deterioration.  The roof overlooks a grassy courtyard in which figures can be seen engaged in rigorous guild exercises.  A rope ladder leads down.  A rope bridge offers a route to the roof of the River's Rest Inn."
