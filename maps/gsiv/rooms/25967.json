    "Twin pools of water lap gently at the soil on either side of the path, joined by a tiny trickle of water that cuts across the walkway.  Smooth stepping stones have been placed in the shallow water to allow easy passage over the watercourse.  Brilliantly colored koi swim lazily through the pools."
