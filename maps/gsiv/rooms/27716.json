  "description": [
    "A single steel shield hangs over the entryway, its edges trimmed with stained leather and its surface heavily scarred.  A winding staircase slowly ascends the length of the tower, an iron-barred gate set at the threshold to ensure that those who enter are well-protected.  A few hardy patches of weed have grown in the cracks along the floor, enjoying shelter from the cold outside in this safe haven."
