    "The edges of the platform here are open, allowing a gentle breeze to pass by, carrying with it a handful of fallen leaves and petals that dance across an assortment of wooden crates packed with goods.  Overhanging branches have been purposefully hung and evenly spaced with an array of colorful paper lanterns softly aglow with green and blue motes of magic."
