    "The twisting path ends in a cramped rounded cul-de-sac, a dark iron gate leading beyond the zig-zag of alleyways.  Numerous stains from water dripping across its surface create a winding, strange pattern across the iron, and flakes from a half-hearted coating of paint are gathered underneath it.  The vague forms of run-down buildings are visible just beyond the gate."
