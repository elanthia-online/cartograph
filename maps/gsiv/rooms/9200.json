    "Extremely loud howling echoes off the outside walls of the keep, clearly coming from a large band of monkeys who are assaulting the tower in earnest.  An amazing assortment of rotted fruits, garbage, and numerous chunks of other unidentifiable substances are being heaved over the walls by the excited animals.  Luckily, the aim of the agitated chimps is a bit off."
