    "Fitted against the brick wall at the back of the courtyard, this cozy stall has a short privacy screen crafted of oak.  Faded paint tints the walls a soft purple hue, which matches the variegated sides of the tin tub at the center of the stall.  Sturdy shelves hold empty vials, trimming shears, hemp bindings, and various other tools used in the dying process, while a ring of empty buckets rests beside the tin tub."
