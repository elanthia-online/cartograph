    "A curious variety of artifacts punctuate the rough pine walls, ranging from a scuffed and tarnished Giantman clan armband to a remarkably well-preserved Dwarven pickaxe.  Small woolen tapestry rugs cover most of the floor, overlapping in casual disarray.  Sitting on the narrow table in the center of the room is a woven basket full of Sylvan woodcarvings."
