    "Falling from the peaked ceiling in tailored pleats, the crimson silk forms smooth walls and pools elegantly on gold rugs.  Frosted glass lanterns dangle from golden chains over a glass counter, providing excellent illumination by which to view the wares, while a pendant lantern hangs over a wyvern-carved polished modwir table that is flanked by a pair of gold-cushioned chairs."
