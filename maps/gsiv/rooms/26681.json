    "The pitch black deep water beneath sends chillier waters washing over you.  Grainy black sand interspersed with small round rocks and other oceanic debris rises and falls from the sandbar with the rhythm of the tide.  A diminutive brown seahorse studies you closely, unaffected by the current's tug, while barely visible fields of vegetation undulate slowly off in the distance."
