  "description": [
    "Evenly spaced rows of ancient spruce dominate this stretch of forest.  Like soldiers reporting for duty, each stands tall and straight beside its neighbor, bending little even when faced with buffeting winds.  Closely spaced needles cling to sturdy branches and thin, smooth-barked cones hang precariously high in each treetop."
