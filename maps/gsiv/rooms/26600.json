  "description": [
    "Reflective glass gleams from within an ornate filigreed golvern frame, the impressive mirror dominating the longest wall of the maple-floored cabin, giving a more open and airy feel to the space.  A line of marble displays presents elegantly styled wigs for browsing customers, directly next to a velvet-inset ebonwood case.  The back of the shop is occupied by a tiered mahogany cabinet that faintly glitters with miniature jewels."
