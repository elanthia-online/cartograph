    "Pale moonlight streams through the three long, narrow rectangular windows along the wall, falling in dim blocky stripes on the items displayed on a sectioned wooden shelf which runs the length of the wagon on the wall adjacent to the windows.  Out of reach of the light is a cowering swamp goblin mannequin, his face turned away from the room and locked in an expression of agony."
