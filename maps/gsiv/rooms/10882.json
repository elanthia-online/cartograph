  "description": [
    "Swift and narrow, the North River rushes madly from east to west.  It is just wide enough that jumping it would likely lead to a quick trip to the bay visible downstream.  From this point, you can see that the brambles extend to the river, overhanging the river bank, their branches dipping into the water.  Stone outcroppings break through to the surface of the thicket and a small lizard sleeps in the moonlight on the flat surface of the largest one.",
