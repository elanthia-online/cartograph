  "description": [
    "Roughly hewn stone benches edge the small, semicircular memorial garden which borders the northern side of a green ash tree.  Resting at the foot of the tree is a highly polished granite block imbedded with a massive, raven-hilted claidhmore.  A single vine of blood-red passionflowers twines about the block and blade, and various other plants and flowers cluster about the area, basking in sunlight."
