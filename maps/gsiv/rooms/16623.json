    "A snarling war griffin painting hangs on one of the gold-veined marble walls, and a glass-tiled vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A mantling griffin statuette sits in one corner of a gold-speckled marble floor.  There is a gold-veined black marble counter on one side of the shop and a twisted dark metal rack on the other."
