    "Loud and abusive noises emanate from the kitchen doors, accompanied by the scent of burnt flesh and hair.  Tapestries hang from the walls, depicting gruesome scenes of ghoulish creatures feasting on an old battlefield of bodies.  Hard wooden tables and chairs are placed evenly, allowing enough space for the zombie cook to pass by when delivering maggot-covered meals."
