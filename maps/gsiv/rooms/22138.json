    "The light scent of orange blossom and patchouli rise from a copper burner to swirl throughout this richly colored room.  The center of the room is sunken and filled with lush silk-covered pillows and beautifully woven blankets.  Along the far wall, a collection of pottery and copper objects sit beneath a massive gold-framed oil painting.  Dim light flickers from the many candles set inside a large gilded chandelier that hangs from the center of the ceiling."
