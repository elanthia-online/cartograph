    "The walls of this large, high-ceilinged room are hidden behind ranks of flats, their canvas painted in a wild assortment of scenes.  Splatters of every conceivable color dot the floor of the relatively small open area in the center.  Gargantuan shelves run along one side of the room, packed with sundry urns, statuary, bits of furniture, and other stage props."
