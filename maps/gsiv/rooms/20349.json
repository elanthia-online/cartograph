  "description": [
    "Faded walls of rotting timber are haphazardly covered in areas with dusty green silk draperies.  A cracked, foggy glass window looks outward into the darkness of the swamp.  In complete contrast to the dilapidation, lush carmine carpet covers the floor from a carved-arch doorway to the next wagon.  Displaying a series of wares, a rich hazelnut case and a polished brass rack reside in the two far corners."
