    "Polished cherrywood floors stretch across the room to meet the white stucco walls that are decorated with various pieces of painted artwork.  Silver accents complement the pale blue and violet bedspread that covers the large bed, while several small storage units are hung from the walls and provide ample room for guests to store their belongings."
