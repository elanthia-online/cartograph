    "Tracts of loamy earth radiate outward in concentric circles, bisected by a smooth granite walkway.  Giant glowing toadstools have been carefully tended to, and their thick stems create natural partitions between paths.  A polished marble slab lies at the heart of the courtyard, surrounded by tiny pink-spotted mushrooms."
