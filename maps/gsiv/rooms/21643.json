    "Four rows of pews are arranged in a square, facing inward toward an unadorned altar holding a lamp lit with a steadily burning flame.  Soft gauzy fabric panels drape down from each of the corners of the room.  Suspended from the ceiling, a set of meditation chimes rotates slowly, filling the room with a rhythmic pattern of sound."
