    "A matronly dwarf dressed in chainmail watches as dwarves move through the southern arch.  Brisk traffic proceeds in both directions.  The dwarves that enter and exit the arch are dressed for a variety of functions, from mining to business to pleasure.  One gigantic toadstool sits in a stone pot on either side of the arch.  Their twin pools of white light clearly illuminate the area, making it easy for the guard to spot anyone who might try to pass by."
