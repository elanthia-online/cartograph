    "The spiraling ramp tops out at a wide landing crafted of reclaimed wood, and an enclosure has been build among the wide-spread tree branches, incorporating natural features to support the structure.  Overhead, luminescent orbs of silver and pale gold dance among the leaves of the limbs supporting the arched and latticed ceiling, from which swathes of argent-threaded cerulean silks are loosely draped.  A half-moon marled oak table top has been affixed to a low-reaching limb to serve as a display."
