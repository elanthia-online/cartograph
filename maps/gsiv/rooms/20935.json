    "At this point the mist is thinned sufficiently by ocean breezes to allow for a bit of a sea view to become visible, but even so the sight-diffusing vapors float just above the breakers not far from shore.  The eastern bank of the sandbar, as a raised promontory, offers access to the initial depths of the waters below without the separation of any sort of natural shallows."
