  "description": [
    "Unadorned stone walls and narrow windows leave this room rather stark and austere.  A fireplace fills most of the north wall, and the large table and benches that stand in the center of the room appear to be polished and new.  Against the south wall, two rearing ivory gryphons hold between them an ebony and crimson dart board with silver numerals."
