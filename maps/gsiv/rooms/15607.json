    "Behind the oak bar, many rough-hewn pegs contain a variety of clay tankards while matching shelves in one corner are filled with wooden platters.  A narrow doorway leads out to the grill, from which a variety of mouth-watering smells emanate.  The bar itself is quite high and ornately carved with random scenes of bountiful harvest.  Curiously, there are no stools, though the counter has a smooth lip which appears perfect for leaning."
