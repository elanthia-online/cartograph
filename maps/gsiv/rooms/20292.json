  "description": [
    "A thick cover of native grasses have overtaken the moist ground on the downward slope off the narrow path.  Leading down to the edges of the outer swamp, an abundant ground cover of maidencane grows to the height of a man and sways gently with any perceptible winds.  To the inside of the path, several buildings on raised platforms take advantage of a clear patch of earth."
