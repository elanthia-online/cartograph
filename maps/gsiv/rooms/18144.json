    "An elaborate labradorite-topped mistwood railing surrounds the well of a spiraling silver staircase, which descends from the center of the room into some lower, deeper chamber.  Alabaster tile set in a circular pattern covers the floor, each piece accented with natural silver striations.  The deep sapphire draping of an ornate archway contrasts with the surrounding stone."
