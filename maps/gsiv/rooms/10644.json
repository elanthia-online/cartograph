    "Some luminescent toadstools grow in the darkness beneath the stockade wall, their faint glow adding to the silvery moonlight that bathes the clearing with an unwholesome glow.  Not far from the mushrooms, several abandoned buckets and barrels sit in a haphazard pile, many having spilled their contents through holes in their wooden staves.  A long pole hangs out over the eastern wall of the stockade, a block and tack attached to its end.",
    "Some sickly white toadstools grow in the shadows beneath the high stockade wall, enjoying shelter from the sun that bakes the surrounding grass to a golden brown.  Nearby, several abandoned buckets and barrels sit in a haphazard pile, many having spilled their contents through holes in their wooden staves.  A long pole hangs out over the eastern wall of the stockade, a block and tackle attached to its end suggesting its purpose."
