    "The already treacherous walkway becomes moreso as rising steam collects on the outcropping in a low-lying mist.  At points, any hope of viewing solid footing is lost beneath the grey, leaving only a miasma of haze that slithers over the edge and into the air.  The effect is bewildering, breaths of wind stirring spectral fingers in the air as if at any moment they could reach out and snatch away the ground underfoot."
