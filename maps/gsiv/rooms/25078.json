    "The inside of the barracks is strangely clean for being abandoned.  A long coat rack crests the nearby wall with a stout wooden desk beneath it.  A wooden plaque is attached to the front of the desk, with an arrow pointing down to the trash receptacle.  Leading deeper into the barracks, a widening hallway lined with officers' portraits beckons you further."
