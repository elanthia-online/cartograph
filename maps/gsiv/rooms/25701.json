    "Sprawling out in all directions, the waters of the harbor gyrate with small waves that have frothy white caps.  To the north the distant swimming area is surrounded by a series of blown glass globes, while to the east, west, and south small islands obscure the view of the outer barrier of Charl's Teeth."
