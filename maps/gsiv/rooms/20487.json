    "A silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the white silk-paneled walls, and a sturdy bamboo-rafter ceiling rises overhead.  A tropical floral arrangement sits in one corner of a colorful mosaic floor.  There is some hammered copper display hooks on one side of the shop and a series of low oak shelves on the other."
