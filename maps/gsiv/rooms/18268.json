    "Lapping effortlessly at the moss and algae enshrouded walls of the enclosure, the murky water ripples lazily in ebbs and surges.  Dusky shadows within the cave enhance the absolute darkness of the night outside, and the hushed music of nocturnal creatures accompanies the melodic sounds of the falls in the background."
