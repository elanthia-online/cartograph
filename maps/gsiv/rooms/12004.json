    "The tunnel ends, the wall turning into a rounded corner to the south.  Just above, a tight hole leads up into the darkness.  The hole barely looks big enough for a dwarf to slide down through, and there is no way that anyone, dwarf or larger, could climb up through the hole.  Low whistling sounds emanate from the hole, as if somewhere far above the wind is blowing across the opening.  Bits of broken stoneware litter the floor of the tunnel just underneath the hole."
