    "From a nearby building, smoke puffs out of a stonework chimney at regular intervals, and the scent of roasted meat is strong in the air.  A pair of chairs made from oak and woven willow branches sits on the building's porch, and a small stall has been erected in front, covered by a simple oilcloth roof.  Though the road continues northwardly, a small meandering trail leads off to the southeast."
