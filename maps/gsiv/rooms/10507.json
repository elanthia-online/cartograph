    "Stretching off into the distance are hundreds upon hundreds of lowland beardstongue.  They are interspersed with yellow wood sorrel, green dragons and, naturally, poison ivy.  A soft sighing sound emanates from thin branches of slowly swaying willow trees.  The boles and leaves of the trees appear bleached under the pale light of the moons.",
    "The ground here becomes even softer and wetter.  Standing for an extended amount of time on this muddy, soggy soil gives you the distinct sensation of being steadily sucked underground.  A soft sighing sound emanates from thin branches of slowly swaying willow trees.  Hundreds upon hundreds of lowland beardstongue stretch off into the distance.  They are interspersed with yellow wood sorrel, green dragons and, naturally, poison ivy."
