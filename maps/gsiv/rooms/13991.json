    "Just south of you, numerous iron cauldrons have been stacked against the outer wall.  The flame-blackened bottoms of the cauldrons show the brutal lengths the defenders would go to while guarding the castle.  Oddly, you notice depressions in the dirt where other cauldrons may have sat until just recently."
