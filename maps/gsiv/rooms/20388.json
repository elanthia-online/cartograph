    "Two carved ebonwood tables stand side-by-side here, pushed up against the amethyst velvet walls of the pavilion.  On top of each table are intricate electrum jewelry trees, draped with a variety of colorful fabrics.  Nestled between the leg of one table and the edge of a plush throw rug is a lidless cloth-lined box."
