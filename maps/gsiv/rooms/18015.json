    "Wisps of snow swirl down the street, creating wave-like patterns in the heavier packed snow on the ground.  Small footprints trail back and forth across the roadway, with snowballs splatted all over the ground, some obviously having hit their mark.  The delighted squeals of children echo around, the fierce battle still in full scale elsewhere in the neighborhood."
