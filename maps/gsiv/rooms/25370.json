  "description": [
    "Various sized baskets, crates, and boxes crowd the peripheral area.  Traversing the room's interior is difficult due to a large cluster of furniture.  A dozen human-sized dolls, all dressed in formal clothing and each holding a wine glass, are arranged in a seated position in padded rocking chairs."
