    "A small section of dirt backs up to a pale green structure, its area taken up by a large wheelbarrel, several shovels, and a short bench.  Stretching out beyond it, a large patch of dark fields rolls out toward the horizon.  The pale starlight that shines down from the blanket of a night sky fails to illuminate what lies in the fields, but the strong fragrance of flowers filling the air hints at the growth that most certainly resides there.",
    "A small section of dirt backs up to a pale green structure, its area taken up by a large wheelbarrel, several shovels, and a short bench.  Stretching out beyond it, a field filled with flowers rolls out toward the horizon.  The verdancy appears to be cared for, given its distinct lack of weeds and generally trim edges, yet the plethora of flora springs up willy-nilly and without any true organization or cultivation.  The result is a mishmash of brilliant color encased in wild-looking growth."
