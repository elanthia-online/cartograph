  "description": [
    "Small cages, nests, and piles of rodent bedding are littered throughout most of the tent, and near-constant rustling, scratching, and squeaking noises can be heard.  A path through the clutter leads to a makeshift table fashioned from a heavy linden door resting on slatted crates, a satin-lined checkered trunk thrown open on the floor beside it.  Opposite the entrance flap, a small archway is framed by thick black velvet curtains tied back with vermilion satin cords."
