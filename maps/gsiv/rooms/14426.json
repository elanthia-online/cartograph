    "A simple split rail fence overgrown with climbing pink rose vines borders the walkway.  Through a break in the fence a glimpse of well-manicured grass dotted with picnic tables and shade trees can be seen.

    "A simple split rail fence overgrown with climbing pink rose vines borders the walkway.  Through a break in the fence a glimpse of well-manicured grass dotted with picnic tables and shade trees can be seen outlined by the moonlight.  Nodding in the slight breeze, the heavy pink roses perfume the evening air with their sweet scent."
