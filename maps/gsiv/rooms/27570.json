  "description": [
    "Dangling above a craggy entry, a rough painted oak sign swings in the ambient breeze and is illuminated by caged torches anchored to the roughened walls.  Water splashes out of nine holes drilled into the uneven ground at the center of the chamber, the salty eruptions missing the nearby table, chest, and wooden stick.  Wandering to and fro, a small gap-toothed kid picks up broken bits of wood, debris, and other refuse from the area and drops them in a deep sand-filled crag near the back of the cavern."
