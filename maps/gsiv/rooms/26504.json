  "description": [
    "Bursting through a heavy blanket of mist and fog, the island's landscape emerges, a rare sight from one of the few outlook points on the island.  Deep indigo waters ring the island and lead to a vast sea beyond, with no landmarks or distant coastlines to guide travel.  Despite a thin middle section, a large platform lies at the top of this naturally formed tower, its trunk possibly diminished by unforgiving winds."
