  "description": [
    "The trail ends at the base of a large hillock.  The firs, pines and other conifers crowd up against the hillock, heavily filtering the sunlight that falls on the forest floor.  Notable, in their absence, are the usual small woodland creatures, such as chipmunks and woodpeckers, which normally inhabit the branches of a forest such as this."
