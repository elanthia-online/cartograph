  "description": [
    "Heavy metal chains enclose a number of warped wooden chests, the rusted lengths pulled taut by several large padlocks.  Crumbling vellum posters tacked onto the structure's support beams display a variety of rates and numbers, material splattered in faded ink and dried blood.  A vault guard stands near a massive golden gong, his eyes scanning the vault and its occupants closely."
