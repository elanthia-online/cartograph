    "The timber-braced mortared stone walls of this large storage room are almost completely obscured by the stacks of canvas-draped objects piled against them.  The vague outlines of rectangular frames, tall statues, and other odd shapes stand like ghosts beneath their canvas covers.  Beneath a flickering torch, several paintings have been uncovered and leaned against the wall as if for a better view.  A hint of gold glints from beneath an askew canvas cover.  An open archway leads out of the room."
