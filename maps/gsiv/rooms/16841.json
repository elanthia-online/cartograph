  "description": [
    "Lined up against the grey north wall is a row of copper mash tuns.  A series of white tubes feed each tun with fresh water, while another set of steel-braced tubes carry the wort westward to be boiled.  Attending each tun is a stoic-faced dwarf who carefully monitors the grist, the mashing and lautering processes."
