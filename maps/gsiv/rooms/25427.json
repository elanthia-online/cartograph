    "Natural light pours through lancet windows set along the southern wall, transformed into myriad shades of color by the intricate stained glass mosaics of each.  Thick timbers run the length of the ceiling, adding contrast to the warm stone of the walls.  Opposite a long banquet table ringed with lacquered chairs is a small stage framed in grey velvet curtains.  The wide-planked fel floors are polished to a high gloss, reflecting light from wrought-iron chandeliers above."
