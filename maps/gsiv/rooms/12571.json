    "A wide branch extends east from the bole of the ficus tree, its girth as wide as a road.  Fringes of liana vines give it a veiny look, as if the smooth surface of the tree is covered with skin stretched over its lattice of blood vessels.  Night birds dart among the verdure, squawking and filling the canopy with shadowy movement.  A tangle of vines hangs down from higher branches, providing a busy highway to long streams of ants and other insects.",
