  "description": [
    "The broken road continues to the north, its cobblestones growing closer and more uniform, in contrast to the southwest where it takes a more roughshod appearance interrupted by small plants and trees growing from between the stones.  Bordered by brush and tall brown grass, the great trees of a forest are visible to the south, but only isolated oaks and maples offer any shade or places to rest."
