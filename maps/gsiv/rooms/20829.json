    "A mural depicting symbols of the changing seasons covers the curving wall of this circular chamber.  The floor is tiled in a swirling circle of half black and half white that matches the painted symbol on the door, lending a sense of peace and balance to the room.  A subtle scent of incense rises from a low table near the door."
