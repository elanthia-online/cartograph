    "Thick black carpeting lines the limestone floors at this section of the library and muffles the sound of all foot traffic.  A single frosted globe is suspended by a long iron chain over a long oak table and is the only light to touch the room.  Several empty stools have been neatly pushed against the table for the evening.  Chests, bins and shelves line the three walls, some filled with quills, inks and sand-trays while others are lined with ribbon-bound scrolls.",

Several quiet scribes sit upon the stools that ring the table, each with their heads bent over the scroll that they are carefully working to recreate.
