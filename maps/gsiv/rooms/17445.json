    "Carved from a thick piece of wood and set atop the gate of a split rail fence, a female figure is scrunched down atop an upside-down shield, and her hands tightly grip the shield's rim.  A scarf, wrapped around the neck of the statue, flies up and spreads out behind her, as if caught in a strong gust of air.  The figure's wind-blown hair, bulging eyes, and wide open mouth impart a whimsical appearance.  Farther down the road, a tree stump has pushed aside a section of the fence."
