    "This large hay loft hugs the rafters of the huge barn, creating a cozy and peaceful haven.  The piles of sweet-smelling hay might tempt the house members to lie down and relax after a hard day working the forge or swordfighting.  Sunlight shines through the hay loft doors, glinting off of the metal hooks and pitchforks hanging from the walls.  The faint neighing of a warhorse below reminds you of the work remaining to be done."
