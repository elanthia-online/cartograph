    "Numerous glaes-paneled shadow boxes line the smooth stone walls, housing petrified toadstools, large uncut gems, and antique relics.  A plush, sanguine rolton wool rug lies at the foot of a polished black granite desk with burnished brass accents.  Situated in the far corner is an immense, mithril-traced chest with no visible lock or means to open it.  The faint aroma of brimstone lingers in the air, wafting from a hanging invar censer."
