    "Big umber leather-cushioned chairs are scattered about this rosewood-paneled room, some placed near a rough-hewn stone fireplace at the far end.  In one of the corners opposite the entry, a small felted gaming table stands near an oft-used, ebon-framed cork dart board.  A slight haze clouds near the ceiling, the rich scent of tobacco mingled with aged liquor adding a depth to the atmosphere of this comfortable setting.  An oak-framed glass curio off to one side holds various medals and awards won by Brigatta members."
