    "This room is oddly triangular, with the west wall running perpendicular to the hallway to the east.  A gaping round opening, centered in the flat west wall, holds the rusting framework of a once marvelous stained glass window.  A few colored pieces of glass cling to the iron framework like bits of flesh to bleached bones."
