    "Several varieties of trees grow at the edges of the garden, casting pleasant shadows across the ground with their sagging boughs.  Splashes of color decorate the ground around the white cobblestone path, and the sprawling garden is filled with many different types of flowers that lend their sweet fragrance to the quiet, peaceful surroundings."
