    "Ever-accumulating layers of thick moss from the surrounding foliage drapes over the edges of the mahogany roofing of this hastily constructed booth.  Long, vibrant silk tapestries with floral patterns of green, orange, and pink hang in billowing layers behind a half-sized stained cherry wardrobe and a polished rosewood bureau.  On the counter at the center of the booth rests a velvet-lined oak display case."
