    "Stray rays of sunlight sneak in through two meager windows and splay through the room, creating pockets of luminescence in the otherwise dim surroundings.  Constructed of mismatched planking in a variety of hues, the floor's unfinished wood provides a distinct counterpoint to the bright yellow walls.  A large display counter takes up the majority of the room's space, nearly obfiscating a rickety stairway leading down.",
