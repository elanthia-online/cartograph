    "Carved into the walls, this secluded nook melds into the stone.  The table is etched with the symbol of the Patriarch, its central pattern flanked by twin emblems of the Agrestis.  Crimson veins swirling throughout the alabaster complete the design, giving sharp contrast to the white surface."
