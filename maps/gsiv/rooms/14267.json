    "The noise of the rotunda is drowned out by the roar of a gigantic roaster at the far end of the ceramic-tiled room.  A plethora of spitted goats sizzle and sear in the sweltering heat and flame of the open grill.  Between turns at the fire, a trio of Tehir women chop vegetables and prepare small doughy pockets upon makeshift tables to either side of the pit."
