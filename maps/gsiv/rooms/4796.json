    "A warm, slightly humid stillness pervades the area.  Not a leaf stirs on any of the hundreds of trees surrounding the remains of the cobblestone road.  Movement is absent in the air, but the air is still filled with the sounds of the forest--the buzzing and humming of winged insects, the calls and songs of birds, the croaking and booming of amphibian life, and the occasional far off howl of a coyote or wolf."
