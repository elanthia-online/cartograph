    "Most of the spacious chamber is taken up by a massive brass orrery, the various moons and planets crafted from enamelled metal.  A silver telescope is pointed upwards towards the heavens, its surface holding a pristine shine.  Detailed and precise paintings of the constellations adorn the walls.  A large fissure in the stone ceiling provides the telescope an unobstructed view of the heavens.  Steps descend into a very narrow cleft cut in the rock."
