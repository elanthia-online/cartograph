    "A silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and a glossy modwir plank ceiling rises overhead.  An intricate sea creatures display sits in one corner of a mistwood plank floor.  There is a shell-lined bamboo counter on one side of the shop and an aqua-hued seaglass display on the other."
