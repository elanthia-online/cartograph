    "The wide passageway is well lit by swaying brass lanterns suspended from chains anchored in the teak panelling of the low ceiling.  Pale blue carpeting with a gold, nautical themed border provides plush footing between the various staterooms accessible through the illuminated passage.  A pair of softly glowing wall sconces mark the entry to each side room, beckoning guests to enter and browse the available wares."
