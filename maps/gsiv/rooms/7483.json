    "The shallow stream flowing in from the west empties into a broad pool which butts against the east wall of the cavern.  The surface of the pool is marked with occasional ripples, as if something were moving around below the surface of the water.  Along the bank of the pool, the moss is thick and bushy, providing homes for the small lizards that you can see darting around between the rocks and fungi."
