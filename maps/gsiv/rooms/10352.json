    "The pathway of alabaster cobblestones curves closer to the sluggish expanse of the river, the scattered black oaks and slender ash trees giving way to a rough shoreline of smooth river stones and pebbles.  The dark waters gently lap at the rock-strewn shoreline to the southwest, each small crest topped with a cap of pale foam.  The melodic rhythm of the incoming tide and quiet splash of water on stone is soothing to the ear and mind."
