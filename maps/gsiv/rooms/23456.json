    "Each of the four walls of this tiny alcove bears the image of a grinning skull, crossed by a pair of broken longswords.  A single stool, with uneven and extremely wobbly legs, rests beside a ramshackle worktable crafted from a thin plank of wood lofted by a few crumbling bricks.  A pile of half-created toys litters the surface of the wood.  Appearing newer than anything else in the room, a tiny little notice hangs on a wooden door mostly hidden in the wall."
