  "description": [
    "An ornately beveled slate walkway circles around a brown pedestal.  On the pedestal a fire continually roars to life, and then diminishes again like a great snapdragon, filling the strand with sparks of fiery light.  Across from the pedestal slopes a path leading to a row of darkened stores.  The rest of the street is made of dark green speckled stones, some of which are small, and others are half covered with moss and heather.  Beyond the stores a multitude of houses can barely be seen."
