    "This corner of the structure has been crushed, and the majority of the dislodged pieces of granite and stone have fallen back into the hollow between the inner and outer walls.  Buried deep within the trapped rubble appears to be a skeletal hand reaching out from beneath the debris.",
    "One niche has been fully chiseled out of the granite wall, while the other has only been traced in with chalk.  A straw broom with an oaken handle leans into the corner, and a neat pile of dust and debris awaits collection beside it.",
    "On a table erected just beneath the niches are a pair of pewter reliquaries, with every surface adorned with elaborate etchings and their latches secured with iron locks.  Beside them on the table is an ebonwood box of large indigo taper candles."
