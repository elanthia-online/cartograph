    "Several thick armchairs provide comfortable seating near some accent tables.  The placement of an imposing marble hearth and the high windows suggests the room was once a dining area, but the permeating smell of aromatic cigar smoke and the etched crystal decanter of brandy on the mantlepiece indicate an alternate use to the room now.  A wide archway across from the windows leads back to a living area, while a pair of glass-paned doors opposite the hearth offers a glimpse of a cozy kitchen."
