  "description": [
    "Built with walls of bamboo and a roof of palm fronds, the hut's door is oriented to face due south.  Shelves are lined with bottles and jars.  Standing in the center of the hut is a low table, which is littered with ashes, charred bone, and several bowls.  Vivid markings in red, white, and black are painted all around the hut, their alternating linear and nonlinear patterns flowing from the center of the ceiling, down the walls, and then across blood red sand floor."
