  "description": [
    "The far end of the floating barge is sealed off with a thick curtain, hiding a cozy space from the main area and attempting to discourage customers from venturing any further uninvited.  Glowing brightly, a large brass oil lamp dispels some of the darkness this far from the flap opening directly opposite.  A roughly hewn oak rack suspended by tarnished chains swings overhead as the barge gently rocks in the shallow water, causing its wares to slide slightly as it rocks."
