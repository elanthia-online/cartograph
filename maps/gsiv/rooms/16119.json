    "The stucco walls of the warder's office have been painted a soft, soothing cream color.  An ornate desk and matching display case face the entrance.  In the wall behind the desk is a small slate fireplace.  Large, arched windows, their shutters tightly closed, line the northern wall.  Moonlight filters through the slats.",
