    "[Cooper's Shack]"

  "description": [
    "This tiny shack is littered with tools of the cooper's trade, including mallets, planes, and sand paper.  A small pile of tapered and beveled oak staves sits in one corner of the floor, while a random collection of metal hoops lies in the other.  A small fire burns in a pit at the center of the shack, its smoke winding past an empty rack as it rises through a small hole in the ceiling."
