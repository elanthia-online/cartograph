    "Gold-veined marble walls rise from an ornate ceramic tile floor.  Just above a serene golden wyvern fountain hangs a gold and crimson wyvern tapestry, and a steeply angled ceiling completes the picture.  A clawfooted cherrywood table and a tall oak and ivory cabinet stand side by side in the middle of the room."
