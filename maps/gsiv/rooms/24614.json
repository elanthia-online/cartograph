    "The brook tumbles into a small natural pool formed by piles of smooth rocks.  The water eddies and swirls about as it slips inexorably towards the tiny waterfall at the pool's far edge, where it finally spills over the rocks and continues its journey towards the river.  Sunlight glints off the surface of the water.",

Moonlight shimmers across the surface of the water, painting the landscape in a cloak of pale silver."
