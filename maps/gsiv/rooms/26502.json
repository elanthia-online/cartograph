    "Dark boulders edging the coastline far below appear like fragments of smoldering coal, and wisps of white fog curl upward to a thick cloud just above the towering obelisk's midpoint.  A piercing whistle trails in the wake of gusts through the ladder rungs above, leaving a hypnotic melody lingering in the dense fog."
