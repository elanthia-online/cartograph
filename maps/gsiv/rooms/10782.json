    "The road jogs to avoid a massive boulder just to the northwest.  The rock appears to have been thrust up from the soil at some time and now leans somewhat in a southeast direction as it points toward the sky.  The road builders may have reasoned that it would be much easier to expend a few extra cobblestones moving the road around the boulder than trying to hammer away the rock surface in order to put the road over the boulder."
