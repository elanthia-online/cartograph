    "A long redwood bench sits far aft, backed by a railing that overlooks the squared stern of the ship.  Far enough away from the ceaseless drone of the main propellers to be almost quiet, the deck provides a view of the steering blades situated midway down the ship's hull.  Beyond them is a dizzying view of the night-darkened earth below.  A lustrous redwood sideboard has been bolted to one section of the railing."
