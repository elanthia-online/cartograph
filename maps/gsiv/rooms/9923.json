    "Dingy curtains frame an equally grimy window, its glaes panes so dirty that seeing through them is virtually impossible.  A couch, its stuffing popping out in various locations, rests against one wall.  Pushed up against the opposite wall rests a wooden table scarred with gouges and water rings."
