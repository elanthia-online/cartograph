    "Spanning the short stretch of yard between what appears to be a slate-roofed merchant's stall to the north and Iron Jack's forge, a narrow walkway of paired flagstones runs north to south.  Beyond the stall, the south wall of the city stable forms the backdrop for a row of small, stone-chimneyed sheds."
