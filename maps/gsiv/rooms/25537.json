    "Beneath a high solid white ceiling set with a large circular skylight, a Liabo and Lornon painting hangs on one of the smooth white monir walls.  A tall light oak bookshelf and a wide light oak altar covered with a pristine white linen cloth sit in opposite corners while a large silver and white oval rug woven with a clasped-hands design rests on a silver-veined white marble floor."
