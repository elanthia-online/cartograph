  "description": [
    "The smoke of scores of incense burners fills the air of this room with a thick, acrid haze.  Through this haze can be seen the faint outline of a large, black altar of obsidian surrounded by a high rail.  Behind the altar is an arch leading to a blackened passage. Hanging nearby is a brass tube, or chime, suspended from the ceiling by a thong of leather.  Next to this chime hangs a small mallet.  The two acolytes that greeted you as you entered are standing nearby."
