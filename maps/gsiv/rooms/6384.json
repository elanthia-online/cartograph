    "You are standing on a rocky promontory, gazing up at the steep cliffs of a high peak to the west.  A high ridge leads away to the south, promising passage down into the foothills.  In the side of the cliff you can make out a small cave opening.  There is a faint odor of charcoal rising out of the opening."
