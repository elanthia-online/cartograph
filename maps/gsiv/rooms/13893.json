    "'The Gullet', as dwarven locals are frequently heard to dub it, becomes both narrower and taller than the tunnels in other parts of the citadel of Cavernfast.  The wall carvings assume a likewise elongated appearance.  Elegant swirls begin in compact rings, burgeoning into a wave-like pattern, which bears north in an unbroken cascade."
