    "Rum Tunnel is decorated with the beginning of a mosaic which extends to the southwest, its surface a continuous panorama of color.  A great battlefield is depicted, with armies ranged across the hills in clashing splashes of color and motion.  The lamps above light the tableau, shedding illumination from spiraling profiles which mimic ocean shells."
