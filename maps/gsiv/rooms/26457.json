    "The layout of the well-lit wagon is simple in design, with an elongated indigo marble case and a glass-faced black coral cabinet placed prominently under opposite windows.  High ceilings are softened by sumptuous fabrics that crown the monir walls, the burled wooden panels washed in jewel-toned hues of sapphire and emerald."
