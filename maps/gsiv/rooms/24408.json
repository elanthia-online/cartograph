  "description": [
    "A high wooden fence, half-hidden by vines and underbrush, curves around the south side of the glade.  The forest plants have been trimmed back, forming a wide clearing that seems to serve as a combination exercise yard and archery range, judging by the worn patches of ground and the well-used targets mounted on some of the oaks.  An arched entrance leads into an open wooden pavilion at the west side of the yard."
