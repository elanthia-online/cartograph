    "In the center of the chamber, the roof is collapsed, and the pile of melted refuse glows with ethereal light.  Damaged and now blackened, a ring of stone-carved runes circles the pile of rubble, each adorned with a foreign metal.  A solid stone block the size of a gnome lies cracked evenly in half, its innards carved out."
