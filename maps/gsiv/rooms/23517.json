    "The briliant rays of a tiny alchemical sun suspended from the ceiling fills the tiny room with the lustre of midday.  Flourishing in the tropical light and heat is a tiny lemon tree with an enormous fat red parrot resting comfortably in its shade.  A silk screen painted with lush tropical vistas stands against the back of the room."
