    "A braided sea grass floor spreads across the room in shades of muted greens in a sharp contrast to the pale beige bamboo stalks that line the walls and ceiling.  From the walls jut out several polished display stands offering a selection of items for sale.  Hanging from the bamboo above the displays are groups of carved native masks, each painted in a popular regional style.  Customers point and converse about the masks, noting their authentic qualities."
