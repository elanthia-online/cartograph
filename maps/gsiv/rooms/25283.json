  "description": [
    "A large bed covered in glittering gold fabric dominates the room.  A large silver fist of Kai stands guard over the bed, while an iron-bound trunk sits at its foot.  Statues fill the maoral dresser on the west wall, all apparently handcrafted by a master.  A blue-curtained window looks out through the east wall, a view of the Voln Monastery and graveyard in the distance."
