  "description": [
    "Cupboards line the eastern wall above a smooth granite counter that sparkles in the ambient light with flecks of mica.  Ebon and slate blue tiles create a checked pattern upon the floor, which is reflected in the glaesine globes that dangle from the ceiling.  Pushed against the opposite wall, and set beneath a tiny white oak-framed window, is a small cloth-covered table surrounded by wicker-seated chairs.  A pot-bellied, cast iron stove makes the room comfortably warm from its position near the open back door."
