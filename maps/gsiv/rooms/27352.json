    "Swathes of mango silk form the wide octagon shape of the pavilion.  Along the wispy walls of the room, bejeweled sconces display softly glowing tropical orange-gold lights.  In the center of the pavilion, a gilded zebrawood table is nearly engulfed by a showy arrangement of coconut palm leaves, moonflowers, and plumeria."
