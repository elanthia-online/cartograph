  "description": [
    "Carved into the shape of a carp, the booth's plank table is painted yellow and surrounded by curving benches.  A pair of enormous bulging eyes stands out from the table's surface.  Magical globes that hum at odd intervals are fitted into the eyes, while tiny etch marks create three dimensional scales along the body."
