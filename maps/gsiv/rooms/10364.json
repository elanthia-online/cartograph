    "An eclectic mix of glassware fills a pair of long tables.  Beakers, tubes and dishes make up most of the glassware.  Each table is supported by four legs carved to resemble rampant dragons.  A stunningly carved rolltop desk made from beautiful mahogany rests in one corner.  Quills, scrolls and one overly large bottle of black ink reside on the desktop.  A beautifully crafted scroll case towers over the desk, its many slots for scrolls mostly occupied now by a number of tomes."
