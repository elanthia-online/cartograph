    "Some extremely tiny wire-framed tables and chairs crowd near an oak plank table set with a large steel tray and cups of hot herbal tea.  The white canvas hung along the walls is painted with a trompe l'oeil depicting a green meadow dotted with a variety of wildflowers and miniscule jam fingerprints.  Children occasionally dart behind the unsecured canvas while shouting to their parents to guess where they are.  Their adult compatriots drink their tea with a look of savaged patience."
