    "Polished hardwood floors cover this fine tavern as four carved griffin columns support the massive structure.  A long, curved bar stretches around the room.  Hanging near the stone fireplace and a wood holder is a shield-shaped dart board.  Several card and gaming tables encircle a glossy pine dance floor.  Nearing the posterior, an enormous griffin's head carved of stone rises from the ground.  The griffin's open mouth serves as an entranceway into the tower.  You also see an oak bin and a sign."
