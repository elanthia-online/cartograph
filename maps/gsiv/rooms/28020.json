  "description": [
    "The roar of the crowd is deafening, their collective feet stomping shaking the stands fashioned from rough-hewn aspen planks.  A large sign proclaims this area to be standing room only, while to the west, rows of long wooden benches appear.  Empty ale kegs emblazoned with a golden serpent have been turned into rudimentary chairs next to a short row of steps leading down to a muddy road."
