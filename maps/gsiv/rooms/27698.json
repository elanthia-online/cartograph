    "The dark walls give way to white panels along this section of the hallway.  Vivid splashes of color festoon the walls as if someone stood in the middle of the room and tossed paint in all directions.  Hanging from the ceiling is a crystal chandelier which casts rainbows across nearby surfaces, creating even more chaotic color in this small space.  Beneath the chandelier is a sign and a rectangular mirror on a double-sided easel which is flanked by staff members, and odd stains mar the floor beneath their feet."
