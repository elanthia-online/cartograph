    "A ring of cottonwood trees shelters quaint houses nestled beneath their boughs.  Here and there, beams of light break through the mist, shining down in stark rays which coax drops of dew to glisten.  A bluff rises from the sandy loam, its face incised with a course of steps cut into the granite in a lazy curve that offsets the steep cant.  Above, a rooftop or two can be glimpsed through the thick mantle of trees."
