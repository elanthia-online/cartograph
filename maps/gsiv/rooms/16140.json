    "The bluff comes to a rounded point, then recedes to the south, while towering over the Tempest River and the well-lit town of River's Rest.  Beyond the island, Maelstrom Bay sparkles in the light of the moons and shimmering in the darkness beyond it, the Great Western Sea.  A constant gentle breeze tugs at the stems and petals of white lilies, which grow in patches in the narrow space between graves to the east and south.  Overhead, the dark sky is empty but for the thousands of pinpoints of starry lights.",
