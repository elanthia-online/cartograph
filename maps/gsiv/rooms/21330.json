    "The trunk of this enormous tree is hollow, providing the House with a huge hall of living wood.  Natural knotholes and other openings in the trunk allow light to enter the hall, while layers of carefully arranged branches and bright autumn-colored leaves keep out the weather.  Birdsong fills the air, giving the hall a cheerful atmosphere.  A staircase spirals up around the inside of the tree.",
