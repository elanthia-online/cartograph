  "description": [
    "The rich loamy scent of damp earth, strong but not unpleasant, hangs in the air, and dappled moonlight filters down through the towering trees.  All around, the chirps and calls of various birds can be heard, as can the telltale rustling of small animals scurrying through the brush.  Dense foliage threatens to overtake a winding path as it cuts a narrow trail through the encroaching forest to an old farmhouse a short distance away.",
