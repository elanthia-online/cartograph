    "Brilliant white walls give way on one end to a polished floor of interwoven teak and cedar, while the other end supports a stucco ceiling fitted with tiny frosted glass globes.  Decorative paintings are arranged along a solid wall that shares its space with an open stairway, while the other three walls are fitted with enormous floor-to-ceiling windows of painted glass.  A series of settees and chairs are scattered about the space, each positioned to face an extremely low linden table."
