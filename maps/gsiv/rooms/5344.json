    "Flies buzz around a rotting mound to the north of the path here.  Deadwood, weeds, rotting vegetables, and garbage have been piled here, turning slowly into fertilizer.  This is likely the compost heap for a nearby garden.  A small path leads to the south from here, while the main path continues to the southwest and east."
