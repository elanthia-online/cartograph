    "Piles of refuse are strewn about, including a few slightly less useless implements that must pass for kobold mining equipment.  A delicate odor wafts across the room.  The kobolds have a word for such a place: \"Mukt.\"  The term may be translatable, but no reputable linguist has ever bothered, beyond concluding that it includes the concepts of out-house, kitchen, bedroom, and sauna.  A bit of colored mosaic peeks from beneath a rotting tarpaulin."
