    "Four granite pillars carry the weight of the portico roof, their pale rose stone echoed in the screening wall enclosing the complex.  Behind the wall, surrounding a clear dome, spiral finials perch atop partially obscured buildings.  Clusters of flowers and trees can be seen just beyond the silver-gilt gate."
