    "The solid ebonwood desk and its ornate, high-backed chair dominate the room.  Expansive bookshelves flank the desk and line the walls to the ceiling in orderly rows, but the odds and ends tucked between the leather volumes that belie the rigorous order of the shelves.  Behind the desk hangs a massive tapestry map of Elanith with details picked out in fine silk thread.  Tucked in a corner near the desk is an overstuffed pillow."
