    "A towering pair of rose quartz swans kiss, their heads and necks forming a heart-shaped archway leading into a temple on the north side of the esplanade.  To the east and west of the swans, a thick hedge of rose bushes bearing yellow, white, pink, and deep red roses forms a striking, if impenetrable, wall.  Small rose quartz blocks replace the terra cotta bricks in this part of the avenue.",
