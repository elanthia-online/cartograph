    "[Linden Grove, Path]"

  "description": [
    "While the path loops and gambols beneath the tall, stately linden trees of the grove, the trees give the appearance of watching its antics like benevolent, albeit aloof elders pondering the headlong pursuits of children.  Although the grove seems airy with its tall canopy and spacious growth, nonetheless, to all sides the impenetrable quality of deep forest maintains a presence that is never out of mind."
