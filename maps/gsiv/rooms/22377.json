  "description": [
    "Dark marble paneling strives to cover the sterility of the building's marble construction, though it is unable to obscure the ceiling and floor that are carved in mimicry of fabric.  Recessed into one curving wall, the fireplace displays dark scorch marks and is surrounded by comfortable armchairs flanked by low tables.  Gleaming in the ambient light, a suit of armor stands beside an ornate desk of bird's-eye maple, which has a small wooden chair set behind it."
