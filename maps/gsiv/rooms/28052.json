  "description": [
    "Warm and brightly lit, the small tent has a vaulted roof of white canvas edged with an inverted crenellation of dark red.  Oak planks help to level the ground and keep patrons from walking directly on the muddy ground, though they do little for keeping the thick substance from clinging to lower walls.  A fur-swaddled clerk keeps a watchful eye upon the wares that are laid out for display on a display rack, a large round table, and a white wicker basket."
