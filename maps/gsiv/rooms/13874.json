    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the plain wooden walls, and an exposed pine rafter ceiling rises overhead.  A thick off-white carpet sits in one corner of a varnished dark oak floor.  There is an elegant silver jewelry rack on one side of the shop and a Vornavian silk-lined display case on the other."
