    "The inside of this wagon appears to be a surprisingly spacious, hastily cleaned, showroom floor for fishing supplies.  A compartmented tacklebox adorns the center of the room and is sandwiched between a tall basket filled with fishing rods and a pile of rhimar-lined crates.  A large fish tank rests inside of one of two cutouts in the back wall, the other of which is a conspicuously curtained archway.  A grimy oak door has writing hastily scrawled above it in dried blood."
