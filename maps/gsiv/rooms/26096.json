  "description": [
    "Gold velvet cushions chased with metallic thread to create a raised diamond pattern line the seats gathered here.  Stylized wing sconces of golden silk are backlit with candles that illuminate the translucent fabric and cast a warm glow.  Plump peaches, apples, and pears rest within a large wicker basket at the center of the round table.  The ripe fruit fills the air with its sweet fragrance, mingling with the other tantalizing aromas from the tavern."
