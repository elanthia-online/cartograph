  "description": [
    "Dragonspine Avenue is the main street of Kharam-Dzu.  Most of the people you see are well-to-do dwarves, nattily dressed and apparently in a rush.  The buildings all look new.  Even the cobblestone streets are immaculately clean.  A sturdy set of glaes-banded mithril doors leads into a low stone structure.  The two guards outside clench their pikes tightly, peering closely at all who approach."
