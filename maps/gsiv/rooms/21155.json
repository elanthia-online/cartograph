    "Offering an excellent view of the harbor, the stone-lined walkway opens up into a large cobblestone courtyard.  Beds of bright flowers are planted about, splashing color over the pale grey stones leading up to an elegant whitewashed manor.  A pair of bright ceramic urns flank the staircase, each one filled with beautiful island blossoms.  Several varieties of orchid and fern trees surround the area, creating a colorful canopy."
