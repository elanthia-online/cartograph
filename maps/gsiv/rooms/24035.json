    "Colorful, thick cushions have been piled on tiered slabs of stone that have been hewn from the rear wall of the small room.  The wall opposite the seating area contains a large glass window, which gives an unobstructed view of the arena below.  The remaining walls are hung in a multitude of tapestries displaying various family crests, broken only by an azure arch, which leads back toward the nexus."
