    "Strips of sail cloth are draped from ceiling to floor, covering the walls of the small space.  Sacks of flour are stacked to the side, tiny holes in the canvas allowing white powder to spill out and dust most surfaces in the room.  A splintered board is suspended across two crates, creating a makeshift counter."
