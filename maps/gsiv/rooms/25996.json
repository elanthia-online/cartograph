  "description": [
    "The enclosed garden is ringed by pale granite pillars supporting the gently sloping slate roof.  Across the way, a pale beechwood door leads to another portion of the manor.  A narrow bed of white gravel surrounds a silvery grey stone fountain which centers the garden.  Mixed with shades from viridian to sage, dense layers of moss cover the ground leading to a massive willow.  A woven silk hammock is stretched between two ivory posts that are covered with climbing white roses."
