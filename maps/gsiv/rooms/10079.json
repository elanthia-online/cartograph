    "Linden and beech trees arch over the pathway, their limbs extending outward, meshing into a thick canopy of brown lines and multi-hued green leaves.  Vines cling to the trunks and lower hanging limbs, draping the sides of the path in a concealing curtain of emerald leaves from which come the chirps and tweets of unseen birds."
