    "Wooden planks marked with various symbols and halves of words pile into the eastern corners of the room as if swept there.  Tattered bits of textiles, piles of grain, and other odd smuggled bits mix in with the kindling, and a small pile of an unidentifiable ore has tumbled piece by piece into the next room.  A few odd scorch marks line the dirt in the walls."
