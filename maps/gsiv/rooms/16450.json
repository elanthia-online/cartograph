    "Jeweled tones, those of sapphire, emerald, and ruby decorate the walls in wide streaks of paint that are interspersed with grey and black in mimicry of the walls of a mine.  Wrought iron lanterns dangle from the ceiling over a bed crafted in the image of a wide mine cart, its interior stuffed with a feather mattress. The floor is decorated with smooth sandstone and has a set of iron rails imbedded into it, which terminate at glass-paned doors on one end of the room and a paneled ebonwood door on the other."
