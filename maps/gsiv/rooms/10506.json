    "A cyclopean red mangrove stands in the center of several clusters of various shrubs and trees, under the starry sky.  A gentle breeze softly stirs the dark, waxy leaves.  Its twisted and gnarled roots are a ghostly pale hue and they eerily creep along the ground as if in search of something to devour.",
    "In the center of several clusters of various shrubs and trees stands a cyclopean red mangrove.  Dark waxy leaves cover the topmost portion of the red mangrove, while the bottom portion of it bears a much paler shade of green leaves.  Its twisted and gnarled roots are a ghostly pale hue and they eerily creep along the ground as if in search of something to devour."
