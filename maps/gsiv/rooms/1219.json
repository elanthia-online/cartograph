    "Cicadas and crickets fill the night air with insectile song.  Moonlight illuminates a small path meandering southwest through the blackberry bushes toward the Elven Settlement, civilization and safety.

    "Sunlight pours into this clearing, nourishing the multicolored wildflowers intermixed with the thorny blackberry bushes.  An overgrown path meanders southwest toward the Elven Settlement, civilization and safety.  To the northwest, the living wall of the Vipershroud forest, heavily overgrown and choked with brambles, encroaches upon the bright meadow."
