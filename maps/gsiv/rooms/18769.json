    "Sitting just off an expansive training hall, the alcove itself is also quite spacious, despite being a bit dim.  Scattered large  hunker among myriad smaller cauldrons, pots, and other implements, the clutter setting apart each larger piece from its neighbors and providing a modicum of privacy.  Multitudes of scuffmarks indicate years of cauldron shuffling with little regard for the blue-washed sandstone floor.  Ensconced in one dank corner, a woth flower flourishes."
