    "The rough jumble of rocks almost obscures the small trail, breaking its progress every few feet with turns and stone shelves that must be traversed.  Small, red-leafed shrubs grow in pockets of soil, and moss and lichens cover the rocks.  As the way gains altitude, the view of the grey lake becomes ever more impressive."
