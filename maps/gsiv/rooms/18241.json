    "The cabin floor is littered with empty bottles of different sizes; the majority of the clutter being on both sides of a rusty-hinged wooden door.  Along the eastern wall, a driftwood credenza rests under a large stained glass window that looks out over the deck.  Resting in the center of the cabin, a small bed stands guard over the room, which is quite a mess."
