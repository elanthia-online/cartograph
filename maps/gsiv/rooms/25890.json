  "description": [
    "Clay and shale walls glisten with a slight, damp trickle from the verdant forest above, sproutings of tangled roots run along the sides like skeletal fingers.  The gently sloping dirt floor leads down a torch-lit passage towards a flickering light glowing brightly at the far end.  Along the east wall, a long tapestry has been draped, illumination showing through where the edges warp and bow out."
