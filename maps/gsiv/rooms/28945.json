    "A bronze-wired chandelier hangs high above a rounded velvet-draped table, each limb dangling an oddly shaped glass sphere filled with colorful lightning bugs.  Disjointed tinkling emanates from a tiny clockwork music box in a far off corner, the container occasionally releasing thin plumes of steam above a shelf of dark green foliage.  Set behind the table is a vibrant portrait of a massive galleon, the ship sailing towards a many tentacled shadow looming against the horizon."
