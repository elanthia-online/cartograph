    "A thin haze of tobacco smoke hangs in the air, dispersed slightly by the occasional cool night breeze coming through an open window.  The once bright paint on the wooden posts holding up the thatched grass roof is chipping and faded, carved over with hundreds of names and initials.  A similarly carved rickety cabinet stands in one corner of the room, its shelves overflowing with empty bottles of spirits.",
