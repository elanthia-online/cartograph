    "Very little of the shop is actually given away, spatially, to commerce -- a small counter and a sign on one stone wall are about it.  Occupying most of the space is an immense furnace, which is connected to a set of pipes and an innumerable number of gears, cogs, wheels, and panels.  Sitting next to the contraption is a partially disassembled cog golem."
