  "description": [
    "Wide and windowless, the short corridor is cluttered with all manner of vats, workbenches, tables, drying racks, and frames.  Floor to ceiling shelves are filled with beakers, pumice stones, scrapers, pails, and coils of hemp cording.  A leathery old woman diligently works behind a long counter, splitting her focus between a hide curing frame and some nearby vats."
