    "Wisps of smoke rise from a grate in the street, and judging by the smell, most likely coming from the sewers.  The walkway paralleling the roadway is heavily pockmarked by dripping acid and is stained several unusual colors.  Tipped over on its side, a table with similar damage exhibits a jagged, gaping hole right through the center of its marble top."
