    "Matte black blocks of stone surround you, the cozy surroundings enhanced by small groupings of candles positioned throughout the room.  A small crystal-paned counter stands to the east of the area, its surface lustrous and finely-polished.  Dark gold-bound chests lie to either side of it, and numerous shelves hold sparkling wares overhead."
