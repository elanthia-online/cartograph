  "description": [
    "Rife with vibrant colored blooms, the garden has been designed and manicured with expert care.  Meandering paths weave between colorful flowerbeds and circle the trunks of flowering fruit trees.  Near the center of the garden, an ornately carved stone bench sits next to a small pond.  The surface of the pond is dotted with large water flowers, but occasional ripples reveal the presence of fish and other water-loving creatures.  A vine-covered carved stone stairway with flowering terraces leads to the moonlit rooftop."
