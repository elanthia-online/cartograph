  "description": [
    "Wide windows dominate the southern wall, their yawning expanses nearly touching the polished mahogany boards of the ceiling and the smooth stone blocks of the floor.  Shielded lanterns are anchored to flagstone pillars that mark the turning points of the corridors that stretch to the north.  Rough oak doors reinforced with blackened, wrought iron fixtures stand open and are filled with the dark of night, as well as the heady fragrance of wild dog roses."
