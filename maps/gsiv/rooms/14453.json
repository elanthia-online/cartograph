    "Dark grey stone blocks arch overhead in a barrel vault that supports the tower above, and brass lanterns hang high in the corners, glowing in warm invitation.  The stone floor is barely visible beneath a thick layer of heavily tamped sawdust and sand.  A narrow passage continues northward through an arch leading toward a verdant bailey."
