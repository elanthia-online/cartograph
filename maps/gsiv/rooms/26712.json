    "Sealife-carved railings frame the carpeted staircase of the ship, each wooden fish and mollusk tangled in nets of loose fibers and unfurled tassels waving gently within the chilled water.  A rusted chandelier looms haphazardly above, its glass globes cracked, casting sharp teeth-like shadows against the wooden planks of the area."
