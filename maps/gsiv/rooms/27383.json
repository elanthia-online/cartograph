  "description": [
    "Protected by its crenellated parapet,  the alure of the keep stretches between twin turrets, their azure-on-white pennons streaming against the daylight sky.  Below, the inner ward and its guarded buildings fan out, and beyond the bastioned outer curtain wall the Cairnfang River stretches west towards the sea and Solhaven, opposite the east's vast plains and hills.  Southward, the tall blue granite walls of Vornavis' clifftop enceinte stand fast, while north lays an unending wilderness framed by mountains."
