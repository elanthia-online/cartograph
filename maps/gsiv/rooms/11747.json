    "Strung from the ceiling of the chamber, a single green orb provides lighting to the interior of the cairn, bathing all surfaces in an eerie green glow.  A sarcophagus sits in the center of the chamber, which is slightly flooded by dark, slow moving pools of water.  Armor, weapons, and shields surround, set on racks or placed upon numerous chests, many of antique design or build.  At the head of the tomb stands a banner, reduced to faded cloth by the passage of time."
