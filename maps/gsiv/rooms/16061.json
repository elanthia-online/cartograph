    "Surrounded on either side by dunes covered in sea grass, the cobblestone street culminates in a ramshackle tavern covered with tar-splattered shingles.  Dangling from the lintel on either side of the entry is a pair of copper lanterns, their glass sides reflecting the sunlight in rainbow pools upon the ground.  Beyond the building, gulls dip and swoop, their raucous calls loud and shrill as they attempt to attempt to steal bits of debris from a dilapidated wooden shack."
