    "The surrounding walls are completely translucent, allowing one to gaze freely across the landscape that flows to the ends of the horizon and beyond.  Wispy curls of mist continually swirl and eddy about in mid-air, their sinuous forms holding a pale silvery glow within the soft puffs of cloudy air -- its unfettered light never fully revealed as they whoosh back and forth.  A soft melody trickles in further east, the gentle humming sounds rising and falling in pitch."
