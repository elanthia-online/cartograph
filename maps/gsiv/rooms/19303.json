  "description": [
    "The chamber is more of a wide corridor than what one would consider a traditional room.  Its long expanse of side walls is paneled with richly grained oak, and hung with a number of large canvasses.  On the far wall hang two emerald-colored curtains, one obviously newer than the other, partitioning off the alcoves behind."
