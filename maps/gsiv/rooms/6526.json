    "The footpath grows more tenuous to the north.  Finally, the way is blocked by a mound of earth bordered by a jumble of boulders, the whole covered by a thick beard of resolute prairie grass.  Further progress in a northerly direction seems impossible, however, the trail branches in other directions."
