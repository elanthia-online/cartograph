    "While the trail splits into a junction, its accompanying pines are steadfast and in perfect formation.  The way leads off in its various directions bounded on both sides by the arched canopy, like the intersection of naves in a grand temple to silence.  The wind spits in dizzy gusts, as if undecided upon which path to follow."
