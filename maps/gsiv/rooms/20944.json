  "description": [
    "Thick vegetation grows right up to the sheer cliffs that separate the jungle from the ocean.  Rich salt air drifts down from the heights above and the crashing of waves echoes from the sea beyond.  Several tall durian trees rise up above the jungle, the faintly lingering, faintly sulphuric, scent of their fruit mingling with the coastal brine."
