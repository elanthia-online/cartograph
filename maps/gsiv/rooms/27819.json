  "description": [
    "The backstage is cluttered with more extra scenery, backdrops, scrims, stage furniture and miscellaneous props than seems possible.  A smell of dust, sweat, and paint lingers on the air.  Providing access to the stage are two arches.  A series of controls is located on the front wall, providing a means to open and close the indigo-colored velvet curtains."
