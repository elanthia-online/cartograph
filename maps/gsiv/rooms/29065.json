    "Deep holes lay in wait across the narrow pathway, their muddy margins slick with green and black slime.  The top of one abandoned leather boot peeks over the lip of one deep depression.  A set of humanoid footprints, one booted, one bare, fades away farther down the path.  An enclosing wall of briars surrounds the site, while verdant vines drape down from the treetops above, as if to offer aid to those entrapped in the sucking mud."
