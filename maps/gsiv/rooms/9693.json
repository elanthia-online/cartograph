    "A ragged trail winds through immense tree-trunks, skirting gnarled roots and clumps of ostrich ferns that stand taller than a dwarf.  The trees are so thick, they take on the appearance of a solid wall of deeply furrowed bark, some carrying growths of lichen that protrude from the wood in a wide cascade of semi-circular stair steps.  Finely arched fronds of fiddlehead ferns grow in all directions, slowly waving at the touch of a breeze as if they are watching the trail.",
