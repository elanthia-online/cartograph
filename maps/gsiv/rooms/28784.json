  "description": [
    "Recreated with painstaking detail in the snow is a small walled town.  The sculpture occupies nearly a third of the garden's space and is so intricate as to feature tiny townsfolk of carved ice within its cold streets.  Overhead, branches of towering sugar pines jostle with the lower tops of cedar trees, waving in the breeze as if beckoning garden visitors beyond the knobby fence forming the cultivated area's perimeter.  Far up in the branches of the sugar pine, a bony talisman clacks and clatters."
