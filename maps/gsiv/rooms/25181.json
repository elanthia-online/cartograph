  "description": [
    "Elongated abalone-framed windows line the pale maple walls of this spacious ballroom, their surfaces etched with plumes of floral-accented tracery.  Ornate glass-beaded candle fixtures are suspended at even intervals across the barrel-vaulted ceiling, bathing the room below in a warm, soothing lambency.  An artful mosaic of opaline moonstone tiles forms a stylized stargazer lily that blossoms at the center of the stark ivory marble floor."
