    "Shimmering beads of a variety of gemstones hang from the ceiling of this wagon, their surfaces capturing the light from nearby candles that line the walls.  A makeshift dart board has been drawn onto a patch of canvas that droops over an iron-banded coffer, partially concealing it.  Two featureless dwarf mannequins stand on either side of a polished glass display case."
