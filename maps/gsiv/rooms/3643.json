    "Small lamps light the way leading up to a large, two-story, wooden tavern at the end of the cobblestone path.  Even in the darkness, the numerous shades of blue used to paint the building are clearly visible.  Beneath a small burning lamp is a large silver-framed sign reading, \"Sea Breeze Tavern.\"",
    "Small lamps light the way leading up to a large, two-story, wooden tavern at the end of the cobblestone path.  Even in the darkness, the numerous shades of blue used to paint the building are clearly visible.  A seashell pathway leads to the northwest, where the rotating lights of a lighthouse can be clearly seen.",
    "At the end of the cobblestone pathway sits a two-story, wooden tavern painted in varying shades of blue.  The trim work of the tavern has been painted a deep blue-green, and the shingled roof matches it in color.  A seashell pathway leads to the northwest, where a lighthouse can be glimpsed in the distance."
