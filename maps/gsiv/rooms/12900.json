    "The homes lining both sides of the road here are run down due to obvious lack of care, overrun with creeping growths and thorny bushes.  Tall stalks of yellow and brown grasses obscure the view of the ground surrounding the road, and thick, darkly colored vines tightly clutch the remains of the structures."
