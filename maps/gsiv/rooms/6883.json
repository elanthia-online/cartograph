    "Crystal-decorated sconces hang from the walls of this little room.  Cases filled with knick-knacks and souvenirs crowd each other for space, each trinket hung with a neat little price tag.  Several shopkeepers hustle about, attending the merchandise, watched over by the eagle-eyed wife of the innkeeper."
