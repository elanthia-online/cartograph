    "Charred planks provide the backdrop beneath the ribbons of swamp vines, which reach through the gaps peppering the walls that surround this small area.  Items are displayed haphazardly among the vines on the walls, as if they were odd artworks of the demented.  A few stools sit upon a tapestry rug spread out over the sandy ground.  Sitting unobtrusively upon one of the stools in the corner is a painted zombie gnome."
