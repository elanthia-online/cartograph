    "A stone bird-bath is circled by hardy ice-tulips, their blooms braving the cold and snow in vigorous tones of red, yellow and blue.  Local avians flock to the bath, their bright colors and lively chatter bringing life to the freezing climes.  Houses circle the colorful garden, their shutters painted in bright colors which echo the striking blooms of the ice-tulips."
