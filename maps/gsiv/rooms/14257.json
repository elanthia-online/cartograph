    "Formed from the surrounding stone, the rounded walls and slightly cramped ceiling of this tiny chamber drip quietly with collecting condensation.  Rows of flickering candles resting on natural ledges cast a warm light throughout the room, softly illuminating a statue of a young girl rising fluidly up from waves of carved rock upon the southern wall.  Ensconced by the perpetually frozen waves is a shallow pool, continually fed by the sea below."
