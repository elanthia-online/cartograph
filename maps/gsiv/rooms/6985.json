    "The gorge ends in a sheer cliff face here, but looking at it you notice that the phenomenon is clearly not natural.  The cliff wall is blackened and fused together such that it forms a near glasslike face.  The path that follows along the gorge leads directly up the cliff as though it once continued onward, and the floor of the gorge only contains a mere trickle of water where a raging river once flowed."
