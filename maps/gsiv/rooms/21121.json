  "description": [
    "A rough stone ladder descends from above near the very edge of the room.  The cave's chamber is walled with hard-packed soil, held in by a network of roots that crisscross the walls like the threads of a spider's web, two of which flank a narrow earthen passage.  A large bundle of roots descends from the center of the ceiling in a writhing tangle, some tips curled around glowing crimson globes, creating a macabre chandelier.  Set beneath the roots is a fire pit, while in the background, set into the wall, is a niche containing an ornamented skeleton."
