    "This gallery is an impressive promenade.  Running parallel to the castle's Great Hall, it possesses a lofty, arch-braced ceiling with crown posts.  Apparently, its generous length was once hung with tapestries, and a couple still remain, now thread-bare and faded.  The castle's main door, generously decorated with a carved doorframe and paneling, is to the south."
