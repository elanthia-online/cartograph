    "There are oddly shaped pits and cracks in the surface of the wooden table and on the seats of the sturdy chairs pulled up against it.  The table surface is so uneven, you wonder if it's safe to put down your drink.  A painting of a thrak is difficult to make out amongst the other wear and tear marks on the table.  The thrak is standing on one toe in mid-pirouette."
