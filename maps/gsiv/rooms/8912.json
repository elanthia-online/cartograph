  "description": [
    "A small, roofed structure provides some weather protection on the open top level of the guard tower.  The view north across the bay affords a valuable vantage point, looking out towards the island of Glaoveln, home port of the warlike Ice Krolvin.  To the west and south, the blue rivers and rocky slopes of the Lower Trollfang region provide a breathtaking vista."
