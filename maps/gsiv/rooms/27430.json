    "Small and bright, this space somehow manages to be cozy instead of cramped.  A sturdy oak sideboard sits adjacent to a battered mahogany bar, the surfaces of both covered in edible and drinkable wares.  A set of twisted iron hooks is nailed onto the wall next to a swinging door that leads back to the kitchen.  While the polished wood floors are smooth and unblemished, they seem to have gathered a perpetual layer of shed hair that blows around like miniature furry tumbleweeds."
