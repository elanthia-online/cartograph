    "Rough-hewn fel walls rise to an unfinished vaulted ceiling giving this small room an airy feeling.  Hooks of wrought-iron hang from a sturdy fel beam that acts as the main support for the ceiling above.  Fine furs hang from the hooks, while bundles of various hides are stacked around the perimeter of the room.  A large stuffed bear greets visitors by the front door."
