    "Old, weathered wood creeks slightly in the wind.  Six tall pillars sit in the corners of the gazebo, holding an old shingle roof aloft.  A cool breeze passes through the latticework half-walls of building, chilling the air slightly.  Wooden benches line the walls, except for the entrance, providing a place to rest in the shade.  A small refreshments table sits in the center of the room with a scattering of refreshments atop it.",
