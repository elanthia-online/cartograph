    "Pale stones of assorted sizes comprise the hearth, which is the heart of the room.  Pure white with sharp fangs exposed, a polar bear rug lies stretched out directly in front of the fireplace.  Strategically placed to accent the multicolored floor tiles that are patterned to form the image of a rolton, matching end tables inlaid with lapis lazuli stand beside high-backed chairs.  A silver serving cart with mugs of coffee and hot chocolate rests in a corner."
