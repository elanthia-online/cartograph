  "description": [
    "A wide window with gauzy curtains stands open to the errant jungle breezes, offering ventilation to this small room.  The cobalt blue and buttercup yellow tiles from the courtyard make their appearance here in the surface of a counter that stands toward the back, behind which a young man stands ready to serve any patrons interested in his wares.  Aside from the window and an oak-framed arch, the majority of the bright white wall space is covered with racks of combat gear, each piece polished to a brilliant shine."
