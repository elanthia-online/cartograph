    "Moonlight filters in through the canopy high above you in this standing of trees.  Large half exposed roots weave a tight bramble that surrounds you.  A narrow but well worn path carefully winds its way through a huge tangle of roots.  Hanging down from the tree before you is a long spidersilk ladder which leads upward.",
