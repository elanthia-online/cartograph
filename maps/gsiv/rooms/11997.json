    "The tunnel abruptly ends as the ceiling has caved in, filling the tunnel with rubble and blocking any further movement.  A low moaning fills the area every so often, its source seemingly somewhere past the blockage.  It is not apparent, though, whether the moaning is produced by something alive or just the wind moving intermittently through a passage.  In any case, the only exit direction is to the southeast."
