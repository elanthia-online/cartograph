  "description": [
    "Wooden mannequins wearing sets of chain mail armor stand in shallow niches along the north wall, each posed in an attitude of respectful attention.  Whether plain or ornately wrought, the suits of armor share one characteristic: their obvious age.  Terra cotta tiles pave the floor, their regular tessellation as formal as the mannequins' dignified poses."
