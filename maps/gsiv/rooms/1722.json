    "The clouds open a bit, swirling about to reveal patches of starry sky, then run together to block the light and enclose the area in an eerie, gleaming whiteness.  Often the outcroppings appear to be made of pure ice, affixed to the mountainside by the numbing cold.  Dislodged rocks fall quickly out of sight.  From the perceived sounds, the rocks careen a few times off the mountain and then...nothing.  Perhaps it is too far down for the sound to travel back through the wind.",
