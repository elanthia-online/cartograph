    "Circular stone steps lead into a room with picture windows set in ivory-painted walls which flood the room with light.  One floor-to-ceiling window opens onto a balcony overlooking a garden.  A large platform holding a velvet-draped divan and a carved teak chair sits before a frame which holds rolled up canvas backdrops.  Shelves holding finished works line the walls and a tall cabinet filled with painting supplies behind glass doors is shoved to one side next to a sturdy worktable."
