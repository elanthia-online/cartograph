  "description": [
    "One rebel resident of the Hedgerows did his entire yard in gravel, complete with a large rock garden on the west side of the house.  Nearby houses try to drown it out in a symphony of flowers, plants, and trees.  A treehouse clings to a nearby bough, overlooking the roadway."
