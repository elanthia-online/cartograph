    "High, pruned shrubs run in from the east and west, and bend south to form a brushy barrier between the street and the western wall.  A painted door presses through the foliage to the inside, giving notice of a small bungalow to which it offers entry.  Sounds of conversation and laughter waft out from the shop, accompanied by the sweet, earthy smell of fresh tobacco.",
