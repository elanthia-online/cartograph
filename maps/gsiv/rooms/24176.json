    "Old clawfoot benches line the walls down the length of the wagon.  Over their backs large, bevel-edged mirrors reflect to vanishing infinities.  A leather-padded stool occupies the center of the interior, encircled by a path of worn floorboards.  The ginger wisp of an odd shorn lock lies curled in an unswept corner."
