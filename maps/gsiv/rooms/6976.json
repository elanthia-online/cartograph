    "This is some sort of cavern, hollowed out by the past action of the stream.  The walls are smooth and wet, and mineral-laden water drips from the ceiling, forming a number of sharp stalagmites on the floor.  High above here a circle of light shows clearly through the darkness.  In the murk you can see a steeply sloping passageway leading up towards it.  From the north comes the hollow echo of trickling water."
