    "An assortment of small trees in boulder-shaped planters have been placed in this section of the tent; their branches strewn with vines, among other things.  The path curves along a water-filled stone basin to the north.  Upon the artificial pond are lily pads that serve as perches for a few tiny frogs.  Soft croaks punctuate the overall serenity of the area."
