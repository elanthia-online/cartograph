    "Rough sandstone has been chiseled out here to form a small library, which is dimly lit by a grouping of flickering candles set along each wall.  A small oak bookcase, filled with a copious number of tomes, scrolls, and manuscripts, is pressed against the far wall, and some oak chairs sit to the side to provide a location for a somewhat comfortable read."
