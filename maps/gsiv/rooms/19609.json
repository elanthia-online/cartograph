    "Golden tiles mix with ebon as they stretch across the floor to meet with the linden walls that are accented with ebonwood columns that spiral upward to a sanguine dome ceiling.  Wrought iron wall sconces ring the upper reaches of each carved support and are fitted with dark green, white, and pale yellow tallows, which spread golden illumination through the area.  An enormous stained glass window is the focal point beyond the ebon marble altar and is framed by twin alcoves, one lined in gold and the other lined in silver."
