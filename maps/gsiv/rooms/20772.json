    "Light breezes waft in through an open window, occasionally ruffling papers on a dark driftwood desk that stands, along with its matching chair, beside the curved pale ivory wall.  Oak-framed paintings of local flora and fauna are scattered on the opposite wall, their contents depicted in vivid hues that add sporadic splashes of color to the off-white room.  A rounded oak arch in the flat wall offers entrance into the other half of this circular level of the lighthouse, while a set of spiral stairs leads down."
