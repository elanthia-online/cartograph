    "Rows of primitive bunk beds line two of the walls.  The remains of old footlockers are strewn around the room in chaotic disarray.  Mold grows in the grooves between the wide plank floorboards.  The smell of woodrot and fungus pervades the room.  A set of crude steps lead up through a small trapdoor in ceiling."
