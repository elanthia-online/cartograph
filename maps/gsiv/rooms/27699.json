    "Dark walls surround this space at the end of a long hallway and a patterned area rug in muted browns and golds covers the floor.  On the far wall, a wide window faces the ocean, allowing sunlight to stream in through glass.  A stained glass turtle hangs in the window, catching the sun and casting green-colored squares of light over nearby surfaces.  A sign on a dark green pedestal, an ovular mirror on a metal stand, and a few chairs sit near the window, while several staff members wander between them."
