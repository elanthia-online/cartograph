    "Round walls fitted with floor to ceiling stained glass windows form the east and north intersection of the corridor.  From one direction flows a plethora of blue hues, while from the other are deep plums and violets.  The hues converge upon an alabaster fountain that spills into a small pond, its depths filled with several species of fish from around the island.  Glaesine orbs decorate the ceiling, their glittering hues creating a prismatic effect on the surrounding area."
