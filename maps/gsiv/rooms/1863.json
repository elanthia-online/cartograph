    "Wooden shutters have been propped open, a balmy breeze slipping in and carrying the heady fragrance of native flowers.  The greenery against the outer walls almost encroaches on the windows, lending an exotic air to the setting.  Comfortable chairs are arranged in small groupings, a neatly-lettered sign perched upon each, describing the variety of colors they can be made in.  A length of woven fiber is draped over a door leading into a back workroom."
