    "Wildflowers and dandelions grow up on one side of the dusty road, creating a canvas of color that complements the green and pale crimson rhubarb fields on the other side of the road.  The dirt on the road is soft and slightly mushy, almost muddy, and various footprints clearly mark the ground."
