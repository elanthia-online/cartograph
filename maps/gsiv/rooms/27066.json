    "Wooly thyme and tufted chamomile dance across the ground in a tangled mass that clogs the meandering game trail, their verdant leaves providing shelter for small shrews and hedgehogs.  Moonlight slips through the overlapping canopy formed by the twined limbs of cypress and oak trees, its long bands illuminating sun-bleached canvas squares that are pinned in place by overturned cobblestones.  A leafy vine-covered arch parts the tightly knit foliage to provide passage further into the forest."
