    "A large firepit dominates the center of the room.  No fire burns within, however the ash and charred remains of previous fires still litter the bottom.  A large table stands near the western wall, pitted and scarred from many years of food preparation.  Hanging above the table is a long rack from which hangs a myriad of utensils, from razor-sharp butcher knives to heavy soup ladles.  Cooking pots of all shapes and sizes stand against the eastern wall."
