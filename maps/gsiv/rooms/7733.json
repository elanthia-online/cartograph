    "Spokes of quartz peek out from beneath a large, circular pool, the glassy water illuminated by an eerie glow filtering from above.  Pale white lichen hangs down from the ceiling, casting the chamber in a steady, faint light that shimmers with a rainbow luminescence.  The crystals within the pool continually reflect the unearthly, pristine light, sending off fractured beams across the chamber like twinkling stars."
