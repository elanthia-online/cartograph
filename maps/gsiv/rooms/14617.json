    "Lustrous silvery-grey mistwood walls rise to meet a vaulted ceiling with ironwood beams lending a sense of austerity and devoutness.  Prismatic battle standards representing each of the Arkati line the walls leading to a massive black glaes altar set against the back wall.  Slightly translucent, the altar reflects the light cast by numerous candles placed upon its broad base.  Adeptly crafted wooden stands and racks, displayed at orderly intervals, present a diverse collection of armors and weapons."
