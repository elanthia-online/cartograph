    "A bend in the path here marks a significant change in the terrain.  To the south, the trees are much thicker and the ground less rocky.  To the northeast, the trees are somewhat thinner and the ground rougher, with large rocks and boulders protruding from the underbrush in many spots.  The rising foothills to the east are barely discernible through the thinning trees.",
