  "description": [
    "A broken wooden arrow lies on the ground, seeming quite out of place amongst the flowers and grass of the foothills.  The shaft has been ripped almost in half, several small slivers of wood barely keeping it in one piece.  Brightly colored parrot feathers adorn one end of the arrow and a crudely made arrowhead is attached to the other end."
