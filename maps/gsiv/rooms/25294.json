  "description": [
    "This small, cozy study seems to be carpeted in tart crumbs.  Throughout the room are empty potion bottles and hastily written scrolls.  The walls have been burned to various shades of soot, lending a slight burnt aroma to the air that competes with a faint scent of daffodils.  A short but wide workbench holds jars and bottles of ingredients of all sorts as well as a very large bright yellow silk-bound spell book.  A dainty overstuffed chair sits in one corner, half concealed within the chaos."
