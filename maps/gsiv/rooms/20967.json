    "Several rafts are tied to anchor on either side of the smooth oak dock that occupies most of the rocky landing.  Broad-leafed tropical plants display signs of recent cutting along the edges of the clearing, while a pathway of granite, pebbles, vines, and dirt arcs across the river towards the distant shore."
