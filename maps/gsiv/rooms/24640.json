  "description": [
    "Complementing the dark green tones of layered rugs, pale green silk walls flow around the area like a cocoon.  Several glaesine shelves are spread with an assortment of jewelry and trinkets, their gems and metals catching the light and throwing it back against the tent's ceiling in brilliant displays of bejeweled color.  Placed below a colorful tapestry depicting a ball in progress is a polished thanot table."
