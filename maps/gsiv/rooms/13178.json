    "A broad faewood rises into the enveloping canopy, nesting a modwir-paneled edifice in the midst of its branches.  Extending from the trunk, a spiral of steps wreathes the length of the tree, ending before an arched side entrance.  Columns of warm ginger-gold light stream through the leaves, casting a shifting dappled effect on the peaked roof of the temple.",

Dark silver shadows are projected from the leaves silhouetted against the moonlight, casting a shifting dappled effect on the peaked roof of the temple."
