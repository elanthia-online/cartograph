    "It is dark and snug inside this part of the tree trunk, with the rotting wood emitting a gentle warmth and sickly sweet smell.  Scant light enters through cracks in the curving wooden walls.  Muffled sounds echo to the north and south, though the way is barely visible through the murky dankness."
