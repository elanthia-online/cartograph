    "This spare hallway, running along the castle's front, has no decoration -- only rough, stone walls broken by narrow windows, where bowmen once stood to shoot down at enemies.  Patches of moonlight dapple the rough flagstones of a floor that time has canted into a downward slant.  The passage opens onto a wall-walk at its east end.",
