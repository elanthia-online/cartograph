    "Several groups of dark leather chairs and sofas are placed about a large stone fireplace, a carved bin of sticks nearby.  A modwir sideboard with a crystal tray rests under a large velvet draped window, which looks out over an expansive lawn filled with a variety of citrus trees.  Edged with golden fringe, a plush burgundy carpet covers the polished floor, potted trees contrasting with the dark material.  A carved mahogany door leads into a dimly lit room."
