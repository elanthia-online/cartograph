    "Bands of malachite coil about pale stone slabs to bear an incredible resemblance to the winding body of great snake.  The meticulously positioned emblem creates an opaque green spiral, ending at a large gem cut into the triangular shape of a serpent's head.  Fastened between alabaster columns, a chain of dark silken pennons is outlined in an intricate pattern of ivory scales."
