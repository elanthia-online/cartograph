    "The tall longgrass obscures your vision, forcing you to slowly hack your way through.  As you struggle through the underbrush, you notice the half-buried remains of an unfortunate adventurer lying under a boulder.  Apparently, a vulture circling high above has noticed the dried remains as well."
