    "A midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the pale ivory plaster walls, and an ivory stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A knotted woolen rug sits in one corner of a golden blonde oak floor.  There is a long varnished counter on one side of the shop and a lacquered wooden shelf on the other."
