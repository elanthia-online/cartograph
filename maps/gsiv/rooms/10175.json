    "A large outcropping of jagged boulders to the west rises to support a narrow ledge.  A trail has been dug into the hill around the outcropping by a number of large, heavy feet, providing a way to reach the ledge above.  Though the rocky trail is a bit treacherous, the footholds are firm enough to keep travelers from slipping down the hill."
