    "Trees tower above, light forcing its way through the thick canopy overhead.  An unusual, blue-hued moss grows on several mounds found just off the edges of the trail.  The green shrubbery that carpets the rest of the forest floor turns brown near the moss, and nothing else grows on the odd, elongated mounds."
