  "description": [
    "Banderoles of lustrous cloth spill from the ceiling in delicate cascades, each one marked with a stitched serpent in bronze thread.  They are faded by the sunlight creeping in through the faceted domes overhead, though once they must have been fine quality and untattered.  Sparks of light reflect off of chips of peridot laid into the floor in a sinuous spiral, projecting chrysochlorous glints onto the surrounding columns."
