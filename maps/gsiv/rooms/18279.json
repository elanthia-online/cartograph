  "description": [
    "Extending far into the distance, thousands of trees become a natural, shadow-encased labyrinth.  Endless seas of leaf and trunk provide little in the way of landmarks.  Nocturnal blossoms in eye-catching shapes and colors soon meld together, becoming commonplace amongst the jungle flora.  Even the startling calls of owls and other nocturnal creatures quickly lose their distinction and blend into the music of nighttime in the rainforest."
