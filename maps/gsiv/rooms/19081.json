    "The grand ship's wheel is a beauty, inlaid teak, modwir and maoral woods creating a complex pattern around the circumference.  Each of the wheel's spokes is tipped with a semi-precious stone, alternating amethysts, dreamstones and moonstones.  A glance inside the binnacle box, which supports the wheel, reveals a ship's compass and brass binnacle lamp.  The binnacle bell mounted on top of the box shines in the light, its pristine polish a testament to the care lavished on this vessel."
