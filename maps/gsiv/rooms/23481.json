  "description": [
    "Dark and cold, the saltwater is excessively clear and supplies a great deal of visibility.  To one side, the planks of a large ship curve down toward its bottom, and several small, heavy-paned windows peer out from its side.  The ocean floor is alternately covered in rocks and sand, with large fan-like plants, shells, and sealife adding color to the landscape.  The underwater wooden structure of a nearby dock, which is covered with barnacles and sea stars is just barely visible in the distance."
