    "A canopy of white canvas has been suspended over part of the boardwalk on brightly painted blue poles, allowing a bit of shade over a wooden table and benches in the fresh air.  Seabirds perch on the boardwalk railing, diving for their dinner in the river then returning to preen and squawk on their perches."
