  "description": [
    "Amid the lushly verdant but unexpectedly treeless vegetation at this southernmost point of the rainforest, the spectacular sandstone cliffs of the western coast stand as a fully visible backdrop.  The roar of waves crashing unseen on the opposite side of the stone barrier provides a rhythmic cadence of constant sound, while the tang of saltwater saturates the scent and taste of the redolently humid air.  Densely packed ferns of every shape, texture, and hue dominate the surrounding landscape."
