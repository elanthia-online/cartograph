  "description": [
    "Tibek Circle is an oddly shaped plaza, its perimeter more kidney-shaped than round.  Bordering it on all sides are homes built snugly next to one another.  In the center of the court stands a large sculpture depicting a lean muscular figure.  It stands on a base of polished granite, its color a deep shade of grey."
