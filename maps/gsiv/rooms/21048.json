  "description": [
    "The terrain becomes increasingly more difficult to maneuver through as the density of vegetation increases.  The moistness of the oppressive environment is evident in the humidity, a product of the large amount of rain needed to maintain the lush surroundings.  Palm fronds dip low from their tall trunks, mingling with the tall grasses sprouting forth from the damp soil.  Fallen fruit, rotting amongst the decaying leaves that litter the ground, aid in the fertilizing of the soil beneath."
