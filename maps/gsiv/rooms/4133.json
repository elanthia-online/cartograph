  "description": [
    "The ledge narrows along here, and you step carefully, eyeing the lava pool below.  Every few minutes, the crust will rise up, slowly forming a bump, a hill, a bubble, the crust sliding down the sides, leaving the cooling liquid to pop with a burst of heat and sulphur-stench, sending globs of molten glowing-hot rock flying in all directions.  Luckily, this hasn't happened near you, at least not yet."
