  "description": [
    "An odd combination of pungent and acrid smells lingers thickly in the cramped confines of the hut.  Occasional sharp twinges sting your nose and send ripples down your spine.  Spherical glass pots hang from the ceiling between bunches of drying grass.  Viny tendrils spill over the rafters, moving gracefully with slight air currents drifting in and out of the open doorway.  Lines of shelves stretch wall-to-wall behind a wooden counter, displaying scads of vari-colored jars along their lengths."
