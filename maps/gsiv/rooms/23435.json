  "description": [
    "Through the water, the top edge of a large bed of kelp waves back and forth in the clear, dark blue waters of Darkstone Bay.  Blasting across the surface of the sea, a bone-chillingly cold wind sends saltwater spraying up in violent spasms.  As the mist from the wind's display continually rains down from above, it coats a pile of rocks that jut out from the ocean's surface."
