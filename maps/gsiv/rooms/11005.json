    "An aura of tranquility and somber introspection suffuses the bungalow.  A wisp of smoke, coiling up from ceramic censer molded to resemble a large turtle, carries the sweet odor of cinnamon.  An equipment rack and a tall cabinet stand against one of the pale stucco walls.  A brass-bound chest is pushed into one corner.  Beneath an intricate mosaic is a small wooden crate."
