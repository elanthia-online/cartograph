    "The wind whistles through the roughly built walls of the dirt-floored hut, but the touch of fresh air is not enough to blow away the overpowering stench of sweaty orc that fills the room.  Pallets of dried grass, stacked with stinking, matted furs and rife with crawling insects, are arranged around the filthy floor, and crude talismans of bone and tattered feathers hang from the thatched ceiling."
