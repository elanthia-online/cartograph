    "The two decks converge here to form the narrow point of the bow, and below glittering scales of veniom sparkle with a silvery-blue light of their own.  The sky spreads unhindered for miles around you, and a massive bowsprit extends from beyond the uppermost point of the deck - its surfaced wrapped in ornate designs of dark green ivy.  The deep grey deck curves gently to either side, its fine glossy finish still glinting with reflected light."
