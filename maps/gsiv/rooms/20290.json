  "description": [
    "Bales of hay line twin split-rail fences that run the length of the area creating a long corral.  Colorful pennants painted with comical roltons fly from posts set in the ground at regular intervals.  A bright awning can be seen farther down the raceway.  Leading into the barn, a sliding wooden door stands partly open."
