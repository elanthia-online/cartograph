    "Approaching the heart of the ship, the lengths of crimson-varnished wood give way to lightless blocks of crystal.  An enclosure of precious metals fans out around a pulsating hexagonal blue crystal, the source of an ethereal pulse bathing the chamber in blue-white luminescence.  Faint, haunting notes pour forth from the depth of the crystal in a strange and unending song."
