  "description": [
    "Gilt-based lamps burning here smell sweetly of jasmine and give off little to no smoke at all to pollute the fragrance.  Against one wall of the wagon sits a rose-carved ebony table, and against the opposing wall is a peacock feather-edged table, each with a neatly arranged display.  Above the tables hang corresponding silk banners, the fabric painted in a myriad of hues with the most skillful of brush strokes."
