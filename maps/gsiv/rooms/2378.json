    "Slush and snow trampled into mud are all that pave Incantation Alley, the narrow thoroughfare running between the western wall of Icemule Trace and the Magical Burrow.  The grey granite wall has been scarred and scored by innumerable marks where mystical energy of every sort has gone awry in various failed experiments by apprentice members of the spellcasting professions."
