    "Opposite the rough wooden fence that separates the neighboring land from the dirt road, the rhubarb fields are filled with spring growth.  The pale crimson stalks are glossy, almost lustrous, in the moonlight, and the large, lush leaves are green with life.  A narrow path between two of the rows of rhubarb leads further into the field.",
