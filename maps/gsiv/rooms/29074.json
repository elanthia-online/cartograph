    "Wooden planks provide drier walkways above the muddy ground.  Workstations are spaced about the area, some with wooden tanning racks drying pelts of foxes and hares, others with makeshift benches topped with rusty hammers, saws, and collections of nails.  Patches of moonlight stream randomly from above in this otherwise shadowed area beneath the trees."
