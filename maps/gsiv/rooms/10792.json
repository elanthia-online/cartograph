  "description": [
    "This small circular clearing in the otherwise dense woods contains a single oak sapling, its trunk only the length of a human hand in width.  Nearly half a dozen branches reach out from the tree, but their ends are withered and devoid of leaves as if infected with a foul contagion.  The area around the base of the young oak is raised slightly, as if the small tree had been placed on a pedestal as a thing of some importance."
