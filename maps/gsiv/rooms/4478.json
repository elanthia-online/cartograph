    "An embroidered grey wool curtain has been drawn back from the west wall to reveal a large alcove.  The recessed area is illuminated by an antique iron candelabra set with thick white pillar candles.  Bathed in the warm radiance of candlelight is an array of holy wares that sit on display upon a gold-flecked marble-topped table."
