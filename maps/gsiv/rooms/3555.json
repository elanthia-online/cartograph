    "The small shop has been tastefully decorated with magnificent antiques and pale colored rugs that emphasize the fine objects displayed on the walls.  Lambent light from several ornate brass sconces plays lightly over all surfaces to further enhance the overall elegant setting.  An elderly elven woman hums softly as she meticulously dusts a striking portrait of a beautiful and vaguely familiar face."
