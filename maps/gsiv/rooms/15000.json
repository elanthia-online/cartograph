  "description": [
    "Within this tiny alcove, the alchemist grudgingly takes her rest, pausing from her studies only when at the verge of exhaustion.  An elegant handmade quilt embroidered with an assortment of colorful flowers lies rumpled on the cot.  A globed lantern rests on the corner of the polished mahogany nightstand bathing the room in a soft glow."
