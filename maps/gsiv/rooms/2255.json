    "Across the scarred walls of the kidney-shaped cavern, shadows jerk and dance, leaping up suddenly as a flare of fire arcs through the air, then dying back into the gloom.  To one side, huge fangs of crystalline glaes arch over a large vat of magma.  Smoke drifts around the frightening silhouette, as if it is emerging from the gullet of a beast."
