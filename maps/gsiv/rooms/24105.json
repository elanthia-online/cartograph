    "Thick black canvas walls create a darkened interior that is only countered by an amber-paned lantern that illuminates the center of the room.  In the small dim beam of light a group of mannequins kneel surrounding a mangled carcass.  A cool breeze flutters in through a tent flap, creating the only relief from the overwhelming stench of rot that hangs inside the tent."
