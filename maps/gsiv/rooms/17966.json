    "The narrow, quiet hallway is carpeted in a runner of dark, richly woven wool that muffles the sounds of footsteps.  A small, ornately carved table bears a fine ceramic vase that holds a single graceful iceblossom, and a mahogany plaque hangs on the wall above it.  Heavy silken tapestries in muted patterns line the corridor, insulating against the cold outside."
