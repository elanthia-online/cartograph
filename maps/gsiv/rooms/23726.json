    "Like the entryway, this room is styled with molding-accented white walls, a crystal-decked chandelier, and, underfoot, plush, blood red carpet.  A glass case stands in the center of the area.  Pushed up against one wall, a large statue is situated in such a way as to block a partially boarded-up doorway."
