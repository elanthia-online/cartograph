    "The trail glimmers and flickers as it moves southwest and northeast.  Minute particles of a gem-like substance, imbedded in the rock surface, catch the moonlight and reflect it in tiny bursts of grey and silver.  An old sign, tumbled from its shattered post, lies alongside the trail.  The main trail follows the plateau's edge northeast and southwest, but it also appears possible to move toward the plateau's interior in a northwest direction should one wish to do so.",
