  "description": [
    "Cast in the dim light of wall-bound sconces, the thick steel enclosure of the vault reflects only the barest of shimmers across the small space.  A circular door with brass-mounted handles is latched firmly, keeping the contents safely out of view.  Beside the vault, a musty odor lingers near a stack of splintered crates where spilled coffee, torn leaflets, and empty lunch sacks mark the spot frequented by the hired guards."
