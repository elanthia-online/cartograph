    "A long kitchen island topped with heavy butcher's block is flanked on one side with a row of upholstered stools, and on the other by a brick hearth wall.  Pale moonlight filters through the muslin curtains of the high-set window, reflecting silver light off the droplets of water clinging to the spout of the wrought iron hand pump in the heavy ceramic sink below.  Faint light can be seen down a narrow hallway, and beyond the row of stools are a pair of glass-paned doors.",
    "A long kitchen island topped with heavy butcher's block is flanked on one side with a row of upholstered stools, and on the other by a brick hearth wall.  Warm sunlight and a cool breeze stream through a high-set window, setting its muslin curtains fluttering and reflecting brightly off the droplets of water clinging to the spout of the wrought iron hand pump in the heavy ceramic sink below.  Faint light can be seen down a narrow hallway, and beyond the row of stools are a pair of glass-paned doors."
