    "The trees push closer to the trail, competing for space with the moss and brambles.  Little light penetrates the area.  The heat, however, seems to have no problem penetrating the leafy canopy, helping the humidity to make travel miserable.  A large canine skeleton lies just off the path, half-buried by greenish moss and fungus.",
