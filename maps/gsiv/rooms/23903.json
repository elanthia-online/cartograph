    "Travel to the next platform is blocked by an open space, and the single woven rope bridge that heads to the northwest seems to end at this platform.  The view straight down is obscured by many crisscrossing branches of the rosewood trees that grow in a cluster below, their bodies so intertwined as to almost form one giant tree.  The faint scent of wood smoke lingers in the air, and the gentle rustle of leaves is the only sound."
