    "For a few steps, the trail levels out before churning into a chaos of broken boulders in all directions.  A thin finger of rock soars up from the floor of the ravine, like a gnarled finger pointing at the low-hanging clouds.  Snow and ice coat most every surface with a shiny veneer that glistens in the dim light."
