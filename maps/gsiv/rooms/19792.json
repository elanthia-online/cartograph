    "A harmonious blend of stone and metalwork sweeps across the shrine, present in the walls, domed ceiling, and supporting columns.  Each material's surface has been polished to a high gloss, resulting in the reflected light obscuring the borders between them.  An elaborate eostone altar stands across from a burnished invar gong, connected by a path of etched brass medallions inlaid into the smooth, pale limestone floor."
