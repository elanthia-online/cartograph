    "Open on two sides, the kitchen is supported by wooden posts and sports a polished oak floor.  Large and small river stones form the other two walls, one of which is fitted with enormous baking ovens and a large hearth.  An enormous dining table, surrounded by a motley assortment of oak benches, stands at the center of the room beneath a candelabrum of frosted sea glass globes.  Near the rear of the room is a single oak door that is flanked by glass-front cabinets, while at the front is a set of steps."
