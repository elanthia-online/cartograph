    "Heavy chains crisscross one another as they pass between the two walls.  The rib cages of various creatures dangle from the chains, swaying slightly with the breeze.  A lone orc skull leans precariously off the top of the inner wall, its jaw open in a soundless scream.  A pair of torches do little to cut through the dark gloom.",
