    "The trail winds past a wooden building whose walls are constructed of thick maoral timber, the peeling bark providing a rustic look to the structure.  Several stacks of freshly hewn tree trunks are piled beside the cottage, sheltered by a thick canvas awning.  A carved wooden sign sits atop a post beside the building's door.",
