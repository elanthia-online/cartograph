  "description": [
    "Ivory marble inlaid with green and gold extends to the high, domed roof, contributing to an uncluttered, open feel.  Hanging from the rounded roof, a multitude of pots overflow with flowery growth, their tendrils draping down to mingle with morning glory vines twining up the gazebo's supporting colonnade.  Surrounded by verdant life and soft fragrance, several wicker chairs accommodate striking views of the garden and pond below.  A muster of blue peacocks strut about, their vibrant plumes swaying behind."
