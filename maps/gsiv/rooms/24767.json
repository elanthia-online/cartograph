    "The broad sweep of the limestone floor is interrupted by a well-armed stocky warrior statue.  Halfway to the white stucco ceiling, a fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the rough white stucco walls.  A Vornavian silk-covered table and a set of carved felwood shelves are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
