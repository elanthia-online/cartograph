  "description": [
    "The rasping of wagon wheels and clunks of booted feet on stone accompanying the traffic from the north take on hollow undertones as solid ground and cobbled roadway surrender to the timbers and planking of South 'Haven.  A quiet tavern with a gated patio and smoked windows rules over one of the scant swathes of solid ground, though only the occasional customer slinks inside."
