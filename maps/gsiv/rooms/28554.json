  "description": [
    "Arranged among the travertine risers, spectators are seated, a scattering of fleshless skeletons that sit, heads lolled back or forward or to the side, while some are missing entirely.  The tattered remains of clothing cling to their bony forms, whipped at by errant winds that for brief moments breathe some measure of life into the long-dead corpses.  They, like the arena itself, remain, persisting against the tumultuous elements that rule this place, weathering the chaos and disarray with perseverance."
