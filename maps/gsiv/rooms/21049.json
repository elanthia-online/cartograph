    "Trees, vines, creepers, bushes, and tall grasses create a thick tangle of vegetation.  Rattan palms stretch long stems toward the sky, competing with coconut-bearing palms and hardy banana trees.  Curious monkeys screech and play amid the variety of tree branches, clearly at home high above the jungle floor.  Bamboo edges the area, its strong, graceful shoots whispering softly in the sporadic breezes.  Carpeting the ground, a snarl of pothinir grass helps insulate the already stifling, humid air."
