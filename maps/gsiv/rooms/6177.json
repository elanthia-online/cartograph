    "An empty cobblestone fireplace rests in the western wall, its surface covered in cobwebs.  Encircled by rotting oak chairs, a lengthy wooden table has collapsed near the middle of the room, splintered and cracked down its center.  Particles of dust and debris dance and swirl about the open area, seen clearly in the gentle light that streams in through the thin, open-air windows in the northern wall."
