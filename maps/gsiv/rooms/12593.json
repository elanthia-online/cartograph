  "description": [
    "A single crack mars the side of the tunnel here.  It must surely have appeared in a fairly recent trembling of the island floating here at sea, for the wind does not seem to have smoothed its rough edges.  You might be tempted to run a finger over those rough edges, but for the skeletal hand wedged between them."
