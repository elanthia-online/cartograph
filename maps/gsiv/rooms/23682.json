    "Sawdust covers the wooden floor ready to absorb any spills.  Small cans of dye and paint are stacked in the corner while a variety of material swatches rest in a crate to the side.  Tools of all shapes and sizes hang from ordered hooks on the walls, clean and polished ready for use.  A scarred workbench dominates the far wall its surface marred from years of use."
