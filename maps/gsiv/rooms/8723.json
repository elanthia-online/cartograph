  "description": [
    "The front room of this fine establishment is sparsely furnished.  A small window looks out on the shacks and hovels of the poorest residents of Wehnimer's Landing, a stark contrast to the obvious wealth of this shop's owner.  The walls and ceiling are painted a soothing sky-blue, creating a peaceful atmosphere in which to perform business transactions.  The wall behind the counter has been painted with an amazing fresco which draws your attention."
