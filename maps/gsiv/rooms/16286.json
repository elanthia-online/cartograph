    "Two small sconces sit upon the wall, delicately nailed to the rock.  They send flickers of light dancing around the room and hiss occasionally when small droplets of water fall upon them.  A pair of grey stones sits in the middle of this dank room, leaving plenty of space for perusal of the wares."
