    "Black iron poles along the perimeter tether a variety of silk kites, each one embroidered with the image of a colorful phoenix reaching high into the air.  The benches have been painted in a similarly vivid palette, the swirls of paint depicting a serpent and phoenix locked in combat, each creature inset with eyes of polished stone.  The continuous barrage of color collides with the additional din of the market and joust, creating an almost overwhelming atmosphere."
