    "This quiet space supports a number of well-oiled bookcases filled with thick volumes of both finished and unfinished works.  Lamplight illuminates the room, creating a soft glow perfect for intense study and concentration.  A large stained glass window dominates the west wall, its brilliant hues dulled by the lack of direct sunlight filtering through.  A solid stone archway stands open to the jungle.",
