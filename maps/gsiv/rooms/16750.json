    "Tall hardwoods surround and frame a wide dirt trail that wanders northward, allowing only shafts of moonlight through a thick canopy of limbs and leaves.  Littering the forest floor are the dead and dried foliage of yesteryear, accompanied by the occasional odd bush.  Somewhere, a creature chitters angrily, and its violent outburst echoes through the forest, creating a sensation of emptiness.",
