    "Larkspurs, violets, alyssums, and bluebells thrive here by a gurgling brook.  Offering shades of yellow, blue, pink, and purple, their raceme clusters face the sun, and seem to quiver in excitement whenever a soft breeze sweeps across the ground.  Some spiraling stairs twine around a bole and lead to a shop built mid-level on the massive tree.  An exceptionally over-sized branch droops low offering shade and relaxation beside a whitewashed cottage.  Securely strung up between the trees are well-made hammocks, constructed from woven vines.",
    "Larkspurs, violets, alyssums, and bluebells thrive here by a gurgling brook.  In the pale light of the evening, all of the flowers take on the same ghostly hue and seem to quiver in excitement whenever a soft breeze sweeps across the ground.  Some spiraling stairs twine around a bole and lead up to a shop built mid-level on the massive tree.  An exceptionally over-sized branch droops low, offering shade and relaxation beside a whitewashed cottage.  Securely strung up between the trees are well-made hammocks constructed from woven vines."
