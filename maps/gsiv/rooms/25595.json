  "description": [
    "A constellation of candles in punched metal holders illuminates the narrow garden beside the cooper's shop and the brewery, dappling the grey field stone path and sparkling off the water of a winding stream.  The stream traces the course of the Locksmehr River in miniature, its banks verdant with native rushes and ferns.  A stately oak tree surrounded by a collection of exotic plants stands in the west where Wehnimer's Landing would be on the real river.  To the east, a somnolent buzz points the way to a hidden apiary."
