    "A narrow path leads up the side of a steep foothill to the south and winds down into a wide, shallow valley to the west. To the east, the landscape stretches out into a wide open meadow.  A series of ridges, crisscrossed into rectangles and squares, covers the ground.  The slender mounds of earth and stone mark the final remains of the structures that once huddled within the shadow of the city walls."
