    "This lounge extends the entire length of one side of Rone Academy, taking up a good portion of the second floor.  A semi-circle of long, comfortable sofas faces a massive black marble fireplace along one wall, while another supports a long wooden table.  Several plump pillows and throw blankets suggest this is a comfortable place to work."
