  "description": [
    "This large, open room is filled with successively higher rows of polished ebonwood benches, supported at each end by heavy, dragon-shaped legs of cast silver.  The walls are hung with magnificent tapestries worked in silver thread on a black background.  Each life-sized panel depicts a scene of a mortal and a dragon in some sort of interaction.  At the front of the room is a large dais, behind which the Ord an Dragan standard is displayed."
