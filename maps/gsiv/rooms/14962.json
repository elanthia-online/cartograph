    "Seagulls perch on the heavy stone pilings, ruffling their feathers and diving into the river after the small silver fish that roam around the pier in glistening schools.  Several homes have been built on the riverside along the pier, their small yards ornamented with fishing gear and brightly colored banners that flap in the fresh breeze."
