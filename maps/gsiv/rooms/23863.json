    "A small, but well organized shop, as everything seems to be neatly organized and in its place.  A large silver chest sits in the far corner, out of the way.  A small glass display case sits in the center of the room, to draw eyes to it and make it the most prominent item in the room.  On the wall opposite the chest is a polished wooden clothes rack from which a selection of items hang."
