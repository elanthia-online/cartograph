  "description": [
    "Enormous banyan roots rise out of the sucking ground, their wide arches creating tunnels through the swamp.  Several of the arching monstrosities are draped with heavy layers of half-rotted kudzu, which are tangled into knots around bird carcasses, rodent tails, and vacant bird's nests.  A blanket of heavy shadows spreads across the area from the massive trees and block all but a thin skein of ambient moonlight from reaching the dark soil."
