    "The prolonged, cavernous pathway is formed from a vast deposit of eroded, blue-banded limestone bedrock.  Lavender-grey quartz springs from the crooks of the stone, glinting softly in the light of ornate thanot candelabras.  Exquisitely chiseled flowers, ranging from the mundane to the exotic, take shape from the lower section of the walls."
