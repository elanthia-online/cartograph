    "Blue watered silk walls rise from a glossy mahogany floor.  Just above a well-pruned lemon tree hangs a blue watered silk tapestry, and a mosaic tiled ceiling completes the picture.  A gilded maple cabinet and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
