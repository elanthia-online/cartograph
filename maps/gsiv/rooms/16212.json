  "description": [
    "Majestic, towering trees that merge into the canopy of the jungle to the south, stand over the long neglected and ruined section of the cemetery.  Dark green moss and vines cover broken statuary, obscure headstones and crypts.  The further south the section goes, the more it disappears into the creep of the forest, leaving under the shaded growth unfathomable bulges of vibrant plant life which fade away into the greenness of the jungle."
