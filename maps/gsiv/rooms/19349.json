    "Potted palms in each of the four corners add a splash of green to the otherwise pale brown veneer of this polished bamboo paneled room.  Mannequins of various statures stand along the walls boasting the newest armor styles, and an elaborately carved gold and green marble counter dominates the back of the room.  Shelves have been built into the wall behind the counter, each one holding samples of the various armor accessories up for sale."
