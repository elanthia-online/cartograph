    "Smaller trees have taken root in the shade of the older oaks that bound the ancient riverbed, their leafy branches intertwining in the filtered moonlight.  The subtle, rich scent of earth and rotting leaves drifts through the air.  A narrow strip of ground leading east through the trees has been obviously trampled, as if many visitors have passed in that direction.",
