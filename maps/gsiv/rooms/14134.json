  "description": [
    "The grouping of linden trees meanders away at a sharp turn, leading to a hearty bed of pennyroyal and Imaera's lace.  Standing watch over the area is an immense pear tree, with heavily drooping side branches that yield speckled yellow-green fruits.   An uneven dirt path winds through short jade-hued grasses, ending before an oak and emerald reliquary cloistered within a second cropping of flowers."
