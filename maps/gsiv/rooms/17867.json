    "Several overstuffed couches beckon to those wishing a bit of rest and relaxation.  Small groups of guild members are scattered about the lounge, speaking in hushed tones.  A large golden harp rests in one corner, unattended for the moment.  A narrow window set high in the eastern wall allows a tiny beam of sunlight to glint off the glasses set on the bar.",
    "Several overstuffed couches sitting beneath a narrow, high-set window beckon to those wishing a bit of rest and relaxation.  Numerous tables are already occupied by other guild members, chatting and laughing in small groups as they enjoy a cold beverage.  Most of the conversation seems to center around personal exploits and favorite \"fishing holes.\"  A young woman softly strokes a golden harp in the corner, the soft music soothing and pleasant."
