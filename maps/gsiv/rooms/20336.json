    "Golden trumpet pitcher plants poke their heads out of the mass of ferns that covers the shore and then spreads out like a blanket over the water.  In between the verdant fronds, the brackish water is filled with the debris of dead leaves and rotting plant matter.  A sharply pungent aroma permeates the air, adding a layer to the prevalently damp odor of the swamp."
