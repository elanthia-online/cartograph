  "description": [
    "Gilded mesh encloses a piece of the sky, and you are surrounded by birdsong. Parrots flash their brilliant colors amidst the branches of potted trees, the birds' cries a raucous counterpoint to the trilling of plainer, but more eloquent larks.  The aviary's wire walls permit smaller birds to come and go, but even the fenvaoks seem content with their eyrie above the guild."
