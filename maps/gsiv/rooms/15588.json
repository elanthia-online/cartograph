    "Several trickles of water collect in a small pool at the end of the passageway.  The water gleams faintly in the subdued glow of the lichen lining the damp walls.  Dark and oily, it looks as unsavory as it smells, but the multitude of animal tracks pressed into the muddy tunnel floor around the pool indicates that it is a popular source of water for the denizens of the tunnels."
