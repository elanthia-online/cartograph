    "Wisps of ethereal energy flicker alongside the towering gate, caressing the air around it.  Starting from the gate, interlocking pavers of cobblestone spread northward, leading deeper into the depths of the courtyard.  On either side of the pavers, several trees of alternating colors and heights are planted in wooden boxes."
