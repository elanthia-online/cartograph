    "At the foot of the precipice, the floor is a dangerous jumble of sharp glaes rocks.  In the dense shadows, lumps can be seen here and there, the silhouettes giving away the fact that they are of softer origin than the formidable mountain.  More common in the mess are the arched outline of rib-cages and jutting bones where the flesh of the tunnels' victims has yielded to time and heat."
