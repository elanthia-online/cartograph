    "The light is very dim here and you can barely make out your hand in front of your face.  The wind is but a whisper this deep into the cavern and the only sound you hear are your footsteps as you walk through the tunnel with caution.  The passage begins to narrow and for a moment you would swear you heard something breathing."
