    "Glancing outward, the expansive view of Lysierian Hills and Lake Marliese is breathtaking, the area quiet save for the rustling of branches and the occasional chirp of a cricket far off in the distance.  Scattered across the bluish black sky are twinkling constellations, creating slow moving patterns high above the shadowed floor below.  A small wooden perch has been nestled between a few of the sturdier branches, providing the perfect table for a remote, but intimate picnic."
