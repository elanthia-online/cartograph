  "description": [
    "Half-rotten beams precariously hold up the old roof of the tavern.  Bursts of air rush through the open windows and cracks in the walls, creating a chilly draft.  Grimy unfinished tables and chairs are scattered across the uneven floor.  Glasses of different shapes, sizes and colors sit on top of a shoddy rough shelf on the back wall."
