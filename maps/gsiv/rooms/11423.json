    "The stench lessens as you continue along the passage, yet you are still surrounded by filth.  Rotting leaves and gamey-smelling skins litter the floor.  Dried blood stains the walls and floors, which are pitted and marked as if they had been hit with something heavy.  A large skin lies in the center of the hall."
