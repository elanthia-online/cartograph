    "The broad sweep of the sea glass floor is interrupted by a leaping dolphin statuette.  Halfway to the beam ceiling, a silken sea-themed tapestry hangs on one of the warped driftwood walls.  An oversized sea chest and some stained driftwood shelves are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
