    "Small shrubs of dwarven cypress have been trimmed back to demarcate an obstacle-free line of travel.  Wooden planters with fresh coats of blue and white paint line the walkways to small buildings beside the path.  The quaint flower plantings within them, however, might look a bit cheerier were they not filled with the carnivorous blooms of glistening sundews."
