    "Shadows stretching across the landscape enhance the foreboding backdrop of the jungle against the natural beauty of the coastline.  Foam crests upon the wet sand, and shallow gullies are left in the wake of the ocean as it ebbs from the shore, only to refill with murky water when the tide comes back in.  A salty breeze permeates the cool night air, and moonlight reflects from the dark surface of the ocean as it laps at the beach."
