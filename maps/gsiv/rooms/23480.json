    "Thick planks line the walls, each intersection bolted with steel plates.  The end of the shop comes to a narrow point, a single blackened window in the center of it.  The bulkhead is lined with numerous sailing navigation wheels that are connected to ropes and pullies overhead.  A large rusted anchor is suspended in the center of the room, held aloft by the turnbuckles attached to the ropes.  A wooden hatch is propped open in the center of the room, with a sloppily painted skull and cross bone design."
