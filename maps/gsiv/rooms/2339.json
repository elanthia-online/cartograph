    "The glacial ice has been carved to form two intersecting circles which overlap at the hallway running southeast and southwest.  The area to the north is lined with silken banners that shimmer as they dance in the slight breezes that constantly circle the room.  To the south, the walls are circled with wooden planters that hold a variety of local plants."
