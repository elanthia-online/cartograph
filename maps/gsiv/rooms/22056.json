    "An arched window offers a panoramic view of the town of Wehnimer's Landing.  Beneath the window sits a modwir table inlaid with fine gold tracery.  Four cushioned oak chairs are pulled up to the table.  Facing the window is an exquisite modwir daybed covered with decorative pillows made from fine, rare fabrics.  One wall is dominated by an elegant red-brick fireplace."
