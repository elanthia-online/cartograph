    "The acrid smell of cooking acantha fills your nostrils the moment you step inside the cottage.  Various herbs and flowers hang drying from a line that has been strung back and forth across the room.  Wicker baskets of all shapes and sizes have been laid out across the counter, offering all types of remedies."
