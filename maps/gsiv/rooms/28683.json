    "Crafted from mahogany, this curved bar has been lacquered, giving the dark wood a soft shine.  A beautiful mosaic pattern of colorful glass is set into the surface, their vibrant hues a sharp contrast to the darker shade.  A row of cushioned stools is set before the counter, welcoming travelers to sit and rest a bit.  Illuminating the room is a trio of crystal and copper lanterns that hang from the rafters above."
