    "Dark blue silk canopies cover this spacious shop containing plush couches and comfy chairs, with a thick ornamental rug covering the floor.  Similar burgundy silks drape the walls and windows.  Opposite the door, a counter holds a silver tray and a glass case, behind which is a wood shelf attached to the wall.  In one corner of the subtley smoke-scented space, a small fireplace continually circulates air through its chimney outside.",
