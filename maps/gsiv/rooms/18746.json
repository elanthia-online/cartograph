    "Torches set in simple iron sconces cast their flickering light across this small chamber.  Although its construction of heavy timbers and stone appears solid, its builders wasted no effort on ornamentation.  The top of a domed cistern is visible in one corner, its granite top pierced by a narrow opening."
