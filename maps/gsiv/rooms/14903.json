    "A tall fountain rises above the frost, crafted in the image of a dozen roses set in a crystal vase.  Loose petals made from iridescent crimson silk dusted with fire opal dewdrops float on the water's surface.  Scented honey-colored candles illuminate the shrine, their soft aroma hinting at floral overtones."
