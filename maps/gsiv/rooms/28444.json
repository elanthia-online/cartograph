    "This room is a stark departure from the dark stone that comprises the rest of the keep.  The walls in this area are wooden, smoothly crafted and uniformly painted a neutral eggshell hue.  A small alcove sits to one side, containing a pedestal with an open book on it.  The light sound of a stringed instrument drifts through the area, though its source can't be seen.  Underfoot is a plush carpet tastefully coordinated with the color of the walls."
