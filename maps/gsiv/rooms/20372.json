    "Next to an oval archway, several wooden shelves are lined with folded shirts and tunics.  A large cabinet displays a selection of pants, and another set of sunken shelves displays a variety of vests.  Standing in the center of the room, a selection of jackets and coats hangs from a rack resting atop the lush ebon bearskin rug covering the flooring.  A shoe trunk rests in the corner.",
    "Next to an oval archway, several rune-carved shelves are lined with folded shirts and tunics.  Shuttered light filters through several foggy windows, illuminating a hazlewood cabinet and a set of hazelwood shelves with a dim glow.  Standing in the center of the cobweb-hung room, a rack rests atop the lush spotted owl rug that partially covers a faded crimson carpet.  A shoe trunk rests in the corner, surrounded by sticks of incense that emit a sharp, bitter orange aroma."
