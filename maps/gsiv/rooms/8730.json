  "description": [
    "The cobbled street extends along the riverbank, overlooking the continual traffic of merchant boats that pass to and fro.  Colorful sails and gaily painted cargo ships fill the river, and banners and flags in an equal variety of colors are hung from wooden poles along the road.  A set of weathered wooden stairs leads down to a bustling pier below."
