    "Silvery light filters through a skylight above, washing the stone walls in pale, gentle hues.  Exquisite tapestries line the walls, each more vibrant and colorful than the last.  Swaying gently in the breeze created by passing shoppers, the tapestries are reminiscent of a garden on a late summer's day."
