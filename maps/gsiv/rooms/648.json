    "A large granite boulder, apparently fallen from the mountain's craggy cliffs in some distant age, lies beside the cobblestoned road.  Surrounded by a thick stand of monir trees, the boulder provides a convenient resting place for travellers, and a brief respite from the rigors of the journey."
