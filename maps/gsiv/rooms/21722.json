    "Fine, slightly faded tapestries hang from the walls along this hallway, depicting scenes of glory and honor.  The scenes flow from east to west, telling a story as they go.  Valiant elven warriors fight bravely near the eastern end, only to fall midway through and be anointed heroes in the westernmost tapestries."
