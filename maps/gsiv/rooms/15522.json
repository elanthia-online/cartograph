    "A foul smell, like an unclean bathhouse, fills the air.  It slams into passersby like a brick wall, unrelenting in its nasal assault.  A glass-encased lantern hangs from the ceiling, providing barely enough light to illuminate a heavy iron door and a bolted bronze door in this section of hallway."
