    "Sunlight streams from the low glaesine dome above, gently dancing off the water cascading from a granite fountain placed centrally in the room.  Overhead, a bright blue and silver banner shimmers softly in the light.  Large potted ferns sit on the green marble floors next to stone benches that have been set up for relaxation and reflection."
