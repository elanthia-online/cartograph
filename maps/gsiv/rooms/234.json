    "The dome of a large temple rises above this peaceful square, silhouetted against the starlit sky.  The circular building is surrounded by marble porticos and teak columns, and a promenade leads to two pillars, through which the inner sanctum can be glimpsed.  Priests and worshippers wander here and there, engaged in various rituals of devotion or study.  A locked almsbox is securely bolted to an iron pole alongside the pillars.",
