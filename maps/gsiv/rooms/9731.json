    "The ancient walls of the tree tower up out of sight into the gloom.  Sturdy, darkened wood forms the smooth floor of the great hall.  High above, flickering lights move erratically through the blackness in a bizarre aerial dance.  A steep spiral staircase circles the eastern wall upward to the north."
