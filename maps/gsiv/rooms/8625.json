    "The stone walls are bare, save for a raised mural on the north facing wall, which depicts in great detail the surroundings of Wehnimer's Landing.  Resting on a dais mid-center of the tower, a hand-carved obsidian chair captures the eye.  Deep gouges mar the surface of one of the steps which leads up to the surface of the platform."
