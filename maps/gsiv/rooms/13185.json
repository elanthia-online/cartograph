  "description": [
    "Moonlight streams through the darkened windows, spitting sullen amber shards across the snowy velvet runner cushioning the stairs.  Bolstering the feeble light are a series of white crystal globes spaced at intervals to either side of the street-wide stairway.",
    "Long shafts of daylight, lent warmth and amber hue by the huge stained glass windows set in both bordering walls, infuse the stairway with blinding brilliance.  Beneath the streaming radiance and the additional glow provided by white crystal globes to either side of the street-wide stairway, the snowy velvet runner cushioning the stairs reveals a wealth of prismatic hues."
