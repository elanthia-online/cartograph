  "description": [
    "Travel becomes difficult as the blanket of foliage grows wildly across the ground.  Thick tree roots wind languidly over the floor, and the spindly branches of smaller shrubs extend to form obstacles for a traveler on foot.  Emerald green vines dangle from high upon tree branches near the massive canopy of leaves, various creatures of the night scurrying up and down their lengths.  The moonlight barely penetrates the oppressive darkness, and a cacophony of nighttime sounds echo constantly."
