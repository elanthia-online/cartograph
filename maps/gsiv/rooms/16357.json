    "Cages filled with creatures of all sizes are stacked against the wall of a hut spaced away from its neighbors by numerous yards.  Next to the cages is a small pile of former cage occupants, the remains of sacrifices and divinations.  The air around the hut carries a suggestion of herbs and spices and appears to emanate from cracks in the hut's walls.  Wind chimes constructed of finger bones of various races fill the air with a morbid clattering."
