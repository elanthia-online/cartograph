    "A rockfall to the west has destroyed the old trail.  A new trail, carved through the thick sumacs lining the ridge, winds around the loose, collapsing stones.  The wind causes the sumac leaves to rattle against each other, making a sound like the tapping of old bones.  A copse of birch trees stands to the northeast.  The ridge trail continues down."
