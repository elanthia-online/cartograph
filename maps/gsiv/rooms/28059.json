  "description": [
    "Iron-banded barrels form both temporary dividers and seating in this area of the stands, each one painted with a vermilion phoenix rising up from the surface of black-painted wood.  The mixture of muddied grass and straw clings tightly against the stacked planks and stone arranged in a semblance of horizontal rows, although a few of the pieces have been dislodged from use or perhaps an over enthusiastic observer."
