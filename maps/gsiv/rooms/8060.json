    "A small group of mountain goats leans into the fierce wind, seemingly quite happy with the harshness that firmly grips this mountain.  Their long, white fur whirls in the gusts as the goats eagerly search for palatable flora.  Patches of close-cropped grass provide evidence that some was found."
