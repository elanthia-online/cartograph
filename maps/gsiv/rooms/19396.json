    "Large urns filled with tropical plants decorate the corners of the blue stucco office, while a braided rug of verdant palm fronds spreads across the teak floor.  Wide open windows alleviate some of the oppressive humidity that is characteristic of areas built close to the ocean, their shutter-framed glassless faces providing an excellent view of street and harbor.  Occupying a space in the center of the room is an enormous golden linden desk."
