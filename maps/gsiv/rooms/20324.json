  "description": [
    "The trees thin out here, leaving a large expanse of water between the shore and the next spot of solid land.  In between, lumps of dead, leafy refuse spot the water, shifting occasionally in the visible current.  At the edge of the shore, a large black stone rests beneath a black gum tree, the duo surrounded in a wide radius by nothing but the corpses of insects and small animals in various stages of decay."
