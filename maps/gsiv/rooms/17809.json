    "A pair of dogs feast on an unidentifiable lump of something, growling viciously anytime anybody gets close.  What sounds like an argument is bellowing forth from several of the buildings, confined mostly to yelling and screaming.  An occasional flowerpot sails across the sky, usually missing its mark and shattering against a wall.",
    "A dwarf looms in the shadows, picking her teeth with a small dagger.  She is garbed in expensive elven-crafted clothing, but wears no jewelry.  Her eyes are wary, but her posture relaxed."
