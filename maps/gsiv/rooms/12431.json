  "description": [
    "A fine dust floats up from Crenzen's workbench and drifts around his shop on a breath of breeze, before settling softly upon the simple yet elegant wooden beds he crafts here on the premises.  The woodworker's love for nature's bounty, and his respect for the natural beauty of wood, make his wares a joy to behold."
