    "Hazy moonlight filters in through the crude window cut into the mottled stone walls, dispelling shadows and illuminating the wares.  A rounded oak table is set up next to a rounded mahogany table, each one laden with inventory.   Near a thick cinnamon oak door, a large sign is propped upon a metal stand.",
