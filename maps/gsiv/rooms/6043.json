    "The farmland road makes a right-angle turn, moving off to the north and west.  The culvert paralleling the road on the east side, however, continues to the south, emptying out into a wide slough where the water pools among the thick weeds.  Just to the southwest the road's shoulder plunges down a steep embankment and into a corn field.  A small area of the shoulder, perhaps no more than ten feet wide, allows a gentler climb down in the field of corn."
