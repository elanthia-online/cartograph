    "Bits of leather and other assorted materials are scattered across the floor.  Tools are stacked on top of boxes of goods against the walls of the shop.  Hanging from the ceiling is a single torch, offering some light to the wares on display in a row of shelves.  Positioned against the side of one of the shelves is a rhimar-bound chest, which appears to be locked tight."
