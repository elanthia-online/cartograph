    "A pair of crossed jeddart-axes adorns the wall over a large felwood desk with a padded felwood chair behind it.  Sitting opposite the desk are two stiff-backed hardwood chairs that make the prospect of standing more appealing than settling into them.  But for a small mesh wastebasket, the floor of the office is bare, revealing the seamless granite surface underneath, and an open doorway leads into the hallway to the east."
