  "description": [
    "A gentle slope, barely noticeable, leads down to a swale ridged with a bower of small bushes and scrubby plants fighting to survive near the water's edge.  Some of the roots are exposed and blackened from past floods and the retreating waterline, providing a stark contrast for thick green foliage.  Chaparral broom and coastal sage add their spicy fragrance to the dank odor of the river."
