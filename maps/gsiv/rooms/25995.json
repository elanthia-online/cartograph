    "A series of blast marks and acid scars decorate the reinforced walls of this small building, and the door has been carefully positioned to keep explosions within the room.  Three glaes workbenches are bolted to the floor near a wood-burning stove that keeps the room warm enough for delicate work.  A plaque fashioned from the blade of a drake falchion hangs on one wall, some sturdy iron-banded chairs nearby."
