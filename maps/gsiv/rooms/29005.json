  "description": [
    "The hallway stretches out, long and dark, with walls covered in aged grey silk in a hue like that of an angry deep sea tempest.  A stenciled border trails near the ceiling and the floor, a repeating line of stylized waves in dark blue, and underfoot, a worn carpet runner in the same color cushions the wooden floor beneath.  Beside each door is a single candle-lit lamp, its scalloped shade made of age-discolored tin atop a sooted glass orb."
