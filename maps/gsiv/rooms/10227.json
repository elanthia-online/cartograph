  "description": [
    "The trees that once stood thick in this area have fallen, forming a tiny clearing in the middle of the orchard.  The trunks of the toppled trees form a hedge to the north, east and west, leaving the trail to the south as the only way back into the depths of the orchard.  In the middle of the clearing squats a massive black boulder."
