    "Tiny yellow and white flowers blanket both sides of the small stream cascading across this ice-covered field.  A rainbow of butterflies hover about the flowers, their movements creating an everchanging portrait of color against the snowy white backdrop.  A pair of curved wooden benches face each other, allowing for soft conversation or peaceful meditation."
