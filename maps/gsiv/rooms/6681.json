    "Set into the cold stone floor are a half dozen baths lined with seamless granite.  Steam rolls off of the water in each bath, casting a layer of fog over the entire room.  The steady rhythm of a drop of water falling from the ceiling and into one of the tubs of water is the only sound that pierces the silence here.  You also see a thick black velvet curtain."
