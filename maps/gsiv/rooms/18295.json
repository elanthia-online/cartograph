  "description": [
    "The maze of trees begins to thin, though the canopy of leaves still blots out much of the moonlight.  Normally sturdy, the soil increasingly becomes waterlogged toward the east, the muddy conditions making travel difficult.  As the atmosphere becomes dank, the vividly hued flowers make way for more subdued fungi and mosses.  Clustering around the base of one of the larger trees, a number of pale white mushrooms brighten the area."
