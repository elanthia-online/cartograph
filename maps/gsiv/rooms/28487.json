    "Wavy crimson-hued flames of gold encircle the perimeter of a shallow pool upon the floor, their surfaces dappled with droplets from the steam continually rising up from the waters surface.  The encroaching walls are painted in soft shades of scarlet and textured slightly to resemble the swirls of a roaring inferno.  A bench trimmed with wispy patterns of graceful design sits next to a lustrous circular mahogany table, a collection of multi-hued pots set upon it."
