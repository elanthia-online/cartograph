    "Rough wood serves as the floor, though clearly it has seen better days as it is covered in scratches and drippings of tar.  A giant cloth banner across the back wall, its message written in large print, and serves to draw attention to a polished oak stand that lies beneath.  Off to the side, a cracked wooden rack sits in a corner, while a bright faewood table stands out back near the entrance."
