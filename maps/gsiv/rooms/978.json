    "Much of the forest has been cut away leaving a patchwork of thick stumps.  Drag marks in the ground indicate that the logs were pulled to the roadway, and deep grooves in the road indicate that heavily laden carts moved off to the southwest.  Although no one is cutting trees now, several axes, saws and hatchets in pristine condition rest against a few uncut trees a slight distance away.  Perhaps the lumberjacks have gone home for the night.",
