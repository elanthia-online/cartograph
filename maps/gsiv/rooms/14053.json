    "Just to the north you see a small windowless log building. The front wall of the structure has been knocked down by some tremendous force.  Inside you see many shelves lining the log walls.  On the shelves are scores of broken clear and blue bottles, their contents now dry and useless.  Hanging from the overhead beams are bundles of desiccated herbs."
