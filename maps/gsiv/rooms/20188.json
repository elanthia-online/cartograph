    "Secluded from the rest of the pavilion, the spacious workroom is well furnished.  A thick carpet of dark wool covers the floor, a pattern of swirling brown, grey, and black shades give it a rich texture.  Large cushions crafted from brightly patterned silk are scattered about the floor by a carved modwir bench.  A large oak board rests upon a tripod next to a curtained arch, a fanciful pattern of leaves carved into its wooden frame."
