    "A refreshing breeze blows through the olive trees, riffling through the leaves with the sound of a gossip's whisper.  The lanterns hung from the branches sway slightly, casting strange shadows.  Moonlight filtering through the trees gives an odd hue to the pastel-colored stucco buildings scattered among the trees.",
    "A refreshing breeze blows through the olive trees, riffling through the leaves with the sound of a gossip's whisper.  The colorful ribbons and banners hanging among the leave ripple sinuously.  The sunlight casts dappled shadows on the pastel-colored stucco buildings scattered among the trees."
