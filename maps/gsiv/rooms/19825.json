    "Large niches house statues of nearly every Arkati, each carved from pure white marble.  Prayer mats are set beneath each cyclopean statue's gaze, and banners flutter softly along the walls between the niches.  Candles flickering within each niche cast the surroundings in a soft glow, the intimate ambiance enhanced further by the subtle scent of lilacs and roses."
