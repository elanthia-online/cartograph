    "The cavern's ceiling is lost in the cloying darkness above, and quiet dripping sounds rebound and echo about the massive chamber.  Two flickering torches are set upon the craggy grey walls, casting an uneasy light into the shadows that shrouds the chamber.  The air is mildly chilly deep within the embrace of the earth, and the faint scent of decaying flesh hangs in the air like a fog."
