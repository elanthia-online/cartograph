    "Poorly milled timbers and lashed branches form a catwalk just above the surface of the malignant stream.  A few rusted tin pans and a bucket of dirt suggest that the kobolds conducted what they try to pass off as labor here.  The whole scene resembles a mining operation, normally reserved for gold and other minerals.  Could it be possible that the kobolds spend their days panning for dirt?"
