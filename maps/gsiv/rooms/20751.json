  "description": [
    "A cobbled path, leading from the black gate to the porch steps, breaks the monotony of the white-encrusted landscape.  The path's stones are a multi-hued mosaic that repeats a colorful abstract pattern along its length.  The walkway is free from ice and snow, proof of a groundskeeper who keeps it clear.  Iceblossoms and frostflowers add their pale colors to the flower beds that hug the wall of the low, wide building.  Branching from the main path, a long snow-packed trail leads into the trees at the side of the hall."
