    "The room is painted a deep russet color, edged with oak around its window, floor and ceiling.  A large bed occupies most of the area, leaving room only for bedside table and armoire, all in oak of the same light golden tone.  Linens on the bed and a small braided rug in deep green tones give the room a homey charm."
