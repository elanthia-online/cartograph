    "Tendrils of ivy creep in from the north but are quickly overwhelmed by white jasmine and flaeshorn vines.  A single vine of moonflowers twists across the tops of the cloister's arches and columns, its diaphanous white flowers luminous in the moonlight.  Upon the floor, a mosaic of knotted vines heavily laden with flowers basks in a stream of illumination from the night sky.",
    "Tendrils of ivy reach out from the north but are quickly overwhelmed by fragrant white jasmine and flaeshorn vines bursting with golden berries.  A single vine of tightly closed moonflowers twists across the tops of the cloister's arches and columns, hiding its beauty from the bright sunlight.  Upon the floor lies a mosaic of knotted vines heavily laden with flowers."
