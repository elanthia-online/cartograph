  "description": [
    "The roadway rises slightly above the swamp.  From the appearances, someone has purposely built a small hillock here atop which two massive granite sentinels stand, silent and unmoving.  No method of circumventing the sentinels presents itself.  If one wishes to continue along the road in an easterly direction, one must pass between the sentinels.  Westward the road slides into the swamp and fights to stay above the sucking mud."
