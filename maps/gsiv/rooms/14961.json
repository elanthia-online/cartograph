  "description": [
    "A few birch trees huddle together to create a small glade, their silvery trunks reflecting the gold of the expansive meadow grass surrounding the oasis of shade.  Cabins lurk beneath the trees, their shingled roofs stained moss-green with dew from the boughs.  Trails leading up to the doors of the residences are won from the prairie grass by constant surveillance, and are perilous at best."
