    "A low ceiling arches over the booth, its surface painted with a slightly peeling rendition of a kraken pulling a large ship underneath the waves.  Dark crimson leather lines the twin benches that face each other, and a half-hearted attempt to mend the various tears on them imparts a ragged look.  An iron porthole is set near the table, bits of rust showing around the large bolts of the circular window."
