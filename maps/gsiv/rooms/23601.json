    "Set directly underneath the trapdoor above is a considerably sized star-shaped pool.  Intricately etched golden sconces have been placed along the wall behind it, and a few feet away from the pool stands a stone bench with some towels upon it.  The lighting from the torches reflects on the surface of the water, reflecting a series of wavering lines over the walls."
