    "At the top of this hillock, the view is blocked on three sides by the stands of trees.  The ground is less wet than below, but only marginally so, and the path is still slick from the fog.  Off to the northeast, glimpses of the lake can be seen here and there, as the fog moves slowly across the surface."
