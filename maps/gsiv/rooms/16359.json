    "A blood-covered slab of stone sits in the center of the hut directly between the entryway and a bone and hide altar.  Crudely fashioned cages hang from hooks in the ceiling and birds of varying species fearfully gaze out from behind the thin bars.  The air is thick with the scent and smoke of burning herbs in randomly placed braziers, creating a scented haze that fills the room.  The floor crunches underfoot, carpeted with cast off carcasses and the remains of numerous sacrifices."
