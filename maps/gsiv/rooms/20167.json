    "Bright banners of red, green, and yellow draped beneath wall-mounted torches mark the entrance to a large cedar-planked building.  Potted bromeliads, in a variety of colors, are tucked to each side of the broad wooden stairs.  Sturdy handrailings, festooned with silk ribbons, invite patrons inside for respite from the nighttime chill and fierce, biting insects.  To the west, the sound of laughter filters from an enormous ancient banyan.",
