    "Thick grass and weeds obscure much of the old river road that winds its way to the east and west along the Tempest.  Insects buzz angrily amid the brush, disturbed by movement through the tranquil perches they've found in the tall assortment of grasses and weeds.  Burrs hang threateningly, distracting from what appears to be something constructed by the hand of man to the east."
