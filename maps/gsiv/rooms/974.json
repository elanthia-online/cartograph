    "An occasional clump of snow from an overburdened tree branch falls onto the trail with a loud 'plop!'  The forest is quiet all around except for the moaning of the wind as it courses relentlessly through the conifers.  The trail is easy to follow, appearing to have recently had something wide and heavy dragged through it to uproot the encroaching sawgrass.  It would all be rather idyllic were it not for the frigid, numbing cold."
