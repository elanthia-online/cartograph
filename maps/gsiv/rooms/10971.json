    "Silver Park stretches out to the north, a playground for both young and old alike.  Verdant green grass thrives in the nourished land, surrounding a brilliantly colored Carousel.  The Silver Park Carousel, reputedly the largest of its kind in the world, bears many fantastic carvings of creatures painted in every color of the rainbow parading about its wide circular expanse."
