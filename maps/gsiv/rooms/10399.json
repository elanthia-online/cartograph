  "description": [
    "Hand-knotted throw rugs in vibrant jewel tones adorn the polished white marble floor.  In sharp contrast with the pale floor, a massive dark walnut desk dominates the room.  Its blunt shape is softened by baskets of bright lilies, snapdragons and petunias placed strategically in corners and around the front edge of the desk."
