    "Strung between a pair of stout branches, the woven netting provides a camouflaged perch for observation of the crumbling path below.  Although torn in a few places and adorned with fallen leaves, the web of the netting is surprisingly intact.  Portions of the bark show signs of wearing, perhaps from the leaning shoulders of silent watchers who held vigil in this perch long ago."
