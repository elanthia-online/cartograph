    "Thousands of undead move past, slowly advancing toward an outnumbered band of elven defenders perched atop a far off rise.  A lone figure in black behind the undead horde stands with arms upraised, urging the army forward relentlessly.  Streaks of lightning flash constantly among the roiling dark clouds above, leaving slowly fading crimson trails.  The land is parched and dead with innumerable cracks running through the barren ground and around the boulders.  No senses other than sight seem to function."
