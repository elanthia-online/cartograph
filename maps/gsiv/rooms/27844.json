    "Various statues stand in alcoves lining the smooth walls of this round room.  Eviscerating knives, decks of tarot cards, pouches of sand, and various bowls are carefully nested in the outstretched hands of stone seers representing all the races of Elanthia.  Each statue has been masterfully carved from a single piece of various types of marble and stone.  A large round table sits in the center of the room surrounded by plush high back chairs."
