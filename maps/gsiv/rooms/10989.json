    "Cloaked in shades of deep verdant, this small retreat is enshrouded by willows all around, while vines of ivy twine around their bases.  Flowers of every hue imaginable blossom here and there, adding a splash of vibrant color to the lush green which is so prominent in the area.  Standing to the north, a wooden statue of a woman with benevolent eyes gazes down kindly at you, and at her feet lies a simple wooden altar, its surface completely covered by flourishing white lilies."
