    "Gilt-edged frames filled with awards and commendations line the wall behind a large marble-topped desk.  Three crystalline chandeliers hang from the high ceiling, and a brass-banded trunk flanks one side of an ebonwood door.  Stretching from one side of the room to the other, a plush mountain snowcat fur rug covers the polished hardwood floor and offers a cozy respite."
