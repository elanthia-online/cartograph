    "The walls of the closet are line with shelves containing the necessities of a well-run infirmary.  Time has worked its effect on the infirmary supplies.  The neat rolls of bandages are brown with rot.  Crisply folded sheets are nests for beetles and other insects.  A foul smell wafts from the jars and crocks of spoiled healing salves."
