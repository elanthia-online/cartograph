    "Small hooks have been fastened to the stone wall behind the locksmith's counter.  Dangling from the hooks are key blanks and lockpicks fashioned of a wide array of materials, some plain and others quite ornate.  Multicolored carpets are scattered across the stone floor, glowing in the sunlight beaming in through the glaesine windows."
