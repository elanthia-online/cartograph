    "Two tall wrought-iron candelabras stand on either side of a large oak desk, while a high-backed leather chair sits behind it.  Recessed shelving filled with scroll tubes and dozens of large tomes covers the entirety of the semi-circular wall.  Several round cushions have been scattered upon the floor in front of a grand oak bookcase brimming with pamphlets and journals."
