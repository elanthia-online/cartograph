  "description": [
    "This hallway curves its way further into the house, bending with the architecture of the walls of the tower.  Bright pictures of the local environs grace the walls and dark modwir sidetables stand beside the various doorways.  Upon each table is a crystal budvase, holding a single perfect white rose.  A dark blue carpet quiets the footsteps of the occasional passerby.  Smells of baking a food waft through the air from a pair of carved haon double-doors."
