    "The view from this cool sheltered rise takes in a ghostly finger of beachfront extending out from the tip of the island, the sand reflecting the moonlight with a ghostly hue.  The wide Mistydeep River extends out beyond it, rolling past with small whitecaps breaking the water's surface here and there.  An occasional shadowy barge drifts by, with a lone boatman steering from his perch above the rudder.",
    "The view from this cool sheltered rise takes in a finger of beachfront extending out from the tip of the island, with just enough sand for a picnic.  The wide Mistydeep River extends out beyond it, rolling past with small whitecaps breaking the water's surface here and there.  An occasional barge drifts by, loaded with cargo and passengers, as the lone boatman steers from his perch above the rudder."
