    "Thick, woody, dark green vines make up the walls, floor and ceiling of this misshapen chamber.  Weak shafts of sunlight squeeze their way between the vines to dimly illuminate the area.  Blackened tendrils pulse and writhe on the floor as sparkling discharges of crimson energy keep time to a distant heartbeat, racing along the tendrils to converge in the center of the living floor.  The chamber sways and groans back and forth, as if it was high in a tree somewhere being buffeted by a brisk wind."
