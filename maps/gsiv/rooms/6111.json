    "Crisp air swirls here, carrying little chattering sounds that echo around the canyon.  The wind has frozen the surfaces of small puddles of water that have collected in weatherworn divots on the canyon floor.  Small patches of lichen are the only signs of vegetation within the canyon, though the thickly wooded northern slope of The Krag is visible above the canyon rim.  In the southwestern wall a small crack can barely be made out in the shadows of the canyon.",
