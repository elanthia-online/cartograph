    "Trees crowd one another, vying for space amongst the shadows in a natural battle for resources.  Giant ferns dot the landscape, moonlight glimmering on the large clumps that grow beneath the towering giants as tall grasses and shrubs alternate to fill in any available space in the undergrowth.  Chilly night air carries a hint of the sea as it wafts in, easing the stifling humidity.  Vague shapes rise far beyond the trees in the northern horizon."
