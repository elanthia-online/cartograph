    "Dark, but for the light coming through the arrow slits in the west wall, the upright posts of the garrison's bunks -- still bolted tight to the chamber's other three walls -- form pale stripes against the stone.  A small fireplace is built into the portion of the eastern wall that backs onto the floor's center chamber."
