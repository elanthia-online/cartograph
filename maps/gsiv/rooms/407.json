    "The hides and heads of various violent beasts have been stuffed, preserved then mounted on the unfinished walls of the showroom.  Sawdust has covered the counter and accumulated in small piles on the floor about its edges.  The faint smell of preserving chemicals leaves a rather unpleasant aroma in the air."
