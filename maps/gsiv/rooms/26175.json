    "Short bushes huddle against the northeastern edge of the pathway, their twisted limbs intertwined and their leaves blending together in yellow, brown, and russet groupings.  Dark granite walls rise towards the sky and are capped with an exposed battlement that is devoid of its crenelation.  Elliptical leaves litter the hard-packed dirt."
