    "Crimson walls enclose this room, each strewn with musical notes stamped in gold and silver pigments.  Framed beneath glass are time-darkened parchment music sheets, and a variety of finely crafted instruments are mounted in between.  Underfoot, a rug woven of scarlet and gild-hued threads cushions every step."
