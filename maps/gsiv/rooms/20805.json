  "description": [
    "This small open-air shrine is dedicated to all the Gods and Goddesses of Light.  Twenty-one pillars circle the inside of the shrine.  Each pillar is engraved with the symbols of a different god and a scene depicting the sphere of control for that individual god.  At the foot of each pillar is a small offering bowl.  Resting in the center of the pillars is an altar made from the tree stump of a lightning-struck oak."
