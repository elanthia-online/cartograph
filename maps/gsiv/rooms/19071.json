    "Jutting out slightly over the sea, this small niche of the boat is perfectly rounded.  Several empty crates are piled around a large, black-roped net.  Centered at the edge of the ship, a gap in the railing is filled in with a thick, wide plank that stretches a way's out over the ship's edge to hang over the water in the bay below."
