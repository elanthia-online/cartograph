  "description": [
    "This small chamber is paneled in thick wood.  Sets of round, iron rings are bolted to the walls at intervals and many have lengths of chain hanging from them.  In one corner are three curious contraptions, each one comprised of two parallel, wooden blocks fastened together with iron pins.  A stout torture bench sits in the other corner -- the large crank-wheel at one end and the iron cuffs attached to the other make its function soberingly obvious."
