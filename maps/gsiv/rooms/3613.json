    "The stairwell bursts out upon the landing of a tower bounded by a high stone wall.  Open air blows briskly through the large openings between the walls and the beamed ceiling, carrying a chill on its shoulders and a shriek in its jaws.  A panoramic view spreads itself out against the horizon in all directions."
