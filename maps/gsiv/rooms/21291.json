    "Emerald silk walls rise up to meet a domed sea glass ceiling covering the narrow room.  A large unframed painting covering the eastern wall and a jewel-toned fine wool rug laid upon a shell-inlaid ceramic floor provide additional depth to the small space.  A velvet-lined cherrywood display case and a velvet-draped table flank the rug, and a small potted lemon tree in the back corner fills the room with a fresh scent."
