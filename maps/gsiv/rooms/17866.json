    "An open arch to the east leads into a lounge area.  Although many of the guild's members sleep through the day, the lounge is never empty.  During the evening hours it is far livelier, with the sounds of laughter and conversation drowning out all but occasional bits of music that drift into the hallway, filling the occasional lull."
