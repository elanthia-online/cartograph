    "Dimly lit by a handful of funerary lamps, this chamber resembles a cross between a tomb and a corpse-looter's stash.  Dirt-caked and putrefaction-stained garments, as well as items bearing fresh bloodstains and slash marks, hang from wooden grave markers, while others are neatly arranged inside a rotted casket.  Several smaller items rest atop the casket lid that lies across the casket's foot."
