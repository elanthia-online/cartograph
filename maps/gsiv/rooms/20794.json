    "Winding through patches of herbs and flowers, a narrow footpath comes to an end at the edge of a small wooden dock, which extends out over a crystal blue pond.  Several trees surround the pond, shading most of its shores.  Large lily pads float across the surface of the water, providing ample resting spots for any nearby frogs.  Nestled underneath a tall oak tree is an ornate wooden bench flanked by a bed of sovyn bushes."
