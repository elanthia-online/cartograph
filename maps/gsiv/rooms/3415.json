    "Wooden screens divide this large tent into smaller spaces, but they don't block the howls of agony coming from every corner.  A raised pallet partially obscured by a thin gauze curtain rests conveniently near a set of freestanding shelves.  Stored haphazardly therein are cyclamen roots, a bowl of birch sap, some sheep dung, a bottle of lemon juice, and a tub of quicklime."
