    "Blossoming hibiscus and evergreens soften the stone coarseness surrounding this quiet courtyard.  Flower beds of white roses and bright periwinkles embrace the leafy ferns, cattails, and lily pads of the small, shallow pond at its focus where fan-tailed redfish swim slowly beneath its ripples.  A white stone path winds between the gate and the rolaren portcullis of the north wall.  Subtle movements betray the watchful eyes atop the battlements."
