    "The walls in the hallway are painted sky blue and the thin rug is the color of pale beach sand.  Portraits hang at even intervals on both sides, spaced between a purple oak door, a white wooden door, and a blue driftwood door.  At the end of the hall, a wide rectangular arch opens up into the next room.  Scented oil lamps mounted in elaborate iron wall sconces light this windowless space, the faint smell of an ocean breeze pervades the area."
