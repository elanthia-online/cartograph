    "While floor-to-ceiling beer kegs betray this space as a storage area, puddles of fresh ale show it's still a popular drinking spot in this bar.  Upright kegs and smaller casks serve as makeshift tables and seats, all illuminated by the unsteady flickering candlelight of an overhead cast-iron chandelier."
