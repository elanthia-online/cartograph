    "Stucco seems the preferred building material of the Tavern Burrow residents.  The street has been newly cobbled, and the rough edges cause several people to nearly trip as they hurry along.  A stucco well attracts a group of children, who drop stones into it, then hoot with glee at the muffled splash."
