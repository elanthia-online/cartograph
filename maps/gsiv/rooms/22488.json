    "Black, lifeless eyes stare out from the mounted animal heads that line the interior of the wagon.  A collection of stuffed birds has been strung from the low ceiling, their wings locked as if in flight.  Placed near a scarred table, a large bucket of viscera emits an overwhelming putrid odor through the cramped space.  A light breeze slithers in through the cracks of a boarded up window, creating a light knocking sound as the birds sway into the dark walls."
