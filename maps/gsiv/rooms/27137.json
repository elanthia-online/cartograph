    "Speckled with bits of shimmering blue sapphire, a long grey granite slab rests atop a stack of smaller stones.  Numerous small candles burn atop the piece of rock.  Scattered amongst the candles, small nosegays and flowers adorn the austere makeshift altar.  A small parchment lies in the center of its flat surface.  Tucked off to one side among the tall grass is a vine-covered white oak arch."
