    "A pristine, pale white dock extends from the store and out into the lake, while a variety of small boats are lined up along its sides.  The white walls of the shop glisten with a faint sheen of moisture, and a small door leads back into its cozy interior.  Plants hang from the windowsill of the building, their deep green leaves matching the hue of several lilypads clustered around the dock."
