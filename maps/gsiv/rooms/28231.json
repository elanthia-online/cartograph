    "A wide maoral-paneled window provides a sprawling view of the training grounds and courtyard beyond, the light of the moon bleeding through the glass to create a faint haze throughout the office.  A pronged wooden rack decorated with militia jackets and swordbelts rests in one corner, while a polished bar sits along the adjacent wall.  A few wooden desks and some warcat hide upholstered chairs have been positioned in the center of the room."
