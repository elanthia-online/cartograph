    "Large spines along the neck are half laid back in a posture that accents the statue's somnolent pose.  The neck muscles are pronounced, making the carved scales undulate.  As a result, the footing here is hazardous at best, but the neck spines provide a welcome handhold.  The neck curves west toward the head, and east in a more dangerous climb, up the beast's back."
