    "A couple of halflings occupy the bunks here in the starboard deckhouse.  They look up and smile at the group clustered in the room's south end, when the singing gets loud enough to distract them.  One reads a small, leather-bound book, while the second seems absorbed in the leather strips he's braiding into a belt.  Nothing in the room is out of place, even though its inhabitants are at leisure."
