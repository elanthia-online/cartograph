    "Knotty oak floorboards spread across the room to the surrounding walls of dark pine, which are sparsely decorated with ragged tapestries.  Resting in the corner, between the iron-reinforced door and the narrow ebon-curtained window, is an enormous granite fireplace with a pair of patched leather armchairs set before it.  Partially secluded from the rest of the room is a dirty pile of rags and a low table covered with a dingy cloth."
