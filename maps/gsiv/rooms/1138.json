    "A sturdy bridge rises above the river to the east.  Thick pilings extend up from the river's bottom to support a wide floor of heavy planks and a well-constructed handrail.  The bridge does not appear to be built from any local wood, as there are no stumps visible on either bank.  The maples, elms, walnuts and other deciduous woods do not seem to match the grain or texture of the bridge's lumber."
