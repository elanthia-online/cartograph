    "The broad sweep of the rough dirt floor is interrupted by a thread-bare woolen rug.  Halfway to the pine rafter ceiling, a tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the stark stone block walls.  A long carved oak counter and a series of low oak shelves are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
