    "Part of a weather-bleached skull is lodged firmly into a small crack nearby.  The top of the skull looks like it has been chopped off by a very sharp weapon.  Whether the gruesome remnant attests to a nearby sacrifice or to a struggle of some sort is impossible to tell at this point, the victim's demise was quite foul and final regardless."
