    "A huge trophy overshadows the room's large bed.  The beast hangs from its board in a silent vigil, glass eyes staring unperturbed, as if there was something on the opposite wall of immense interest.  On the bed, green linens and a thick wool blanket provide a comfortable refuge from cold and fatigue."
