    "Hills rise to the south with only a few pockets of yellow grass indicating any life on them at all.  A ridge begins at this point and runs northward, separating the land into a lower forest on the west side and a higher forest on the east side.  Dust rises easily from the parched trail, and the hills certainly look like they could use a good rain.  Erosion appears to be more the work of a steady wind that blows across this area than the result of rainfall."
