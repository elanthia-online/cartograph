    "The broad sweep of the rush-covered floor is interrupted by a small potted lemon tree.  Halfway to the palm frond ceiling, an array of ostrich feathers hangs on one of the sturdy bamboo walls.  Some carved haon pegs and a long mistwood counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
