    "Many mediums come together along the walls here, including stone, metal, and wood.  From one medium to the next, the junctures are smooth.  In the center of the floor, a large table covered with a plush red cloth holds stacks of weapons.  The table, too tall for the shorter races, has several stepstools surrounding it to allow them to peer at the displayed wares here.  A large wooden door, banded with iron, is set in the north wall."
