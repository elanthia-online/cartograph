  "description": [
    "Dust hangs heavy in the air as the western avenue degrades into a dirty road as it curves sharply towards a grassy bluff.  Leafy bushes, laden with dog roses and thorns, form a barrier that prevents a sheer drop to the ocean below, their heady fragrance perfuming the air.  Perched upon the edge of the cliff, a weathered stone building with large windows interrupts the leafy profusions with its grey and white bulk."
