    "The tunnel opens up into a wide, circular chamber.  The craggy rock walls curve overhead into the darkness, their surfaces blackened through the years by the large torches set within them.  A large slab of granite sits in middle of the room, ringed with dark stains, ageless dust and charred stubs of wax.  Deep channels are carved into the stone floor, their crude yet sinuous routes weaving a radiating serpentine pattern around the slab."
