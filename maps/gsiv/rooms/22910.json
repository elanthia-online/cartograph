  "description": [
    "Wide, flat shelf mushrooms grow in a spiral around several dozen of petrified blackgum spires.  The rippled fungi is striated with blue, white, and pink hues, each is curved away from the shaggy bark so that the ribbed underbelly of the mushroom displays the grey feather-like protrusions.  Stagnant puddles ring the churned earth where the roots of the dark trees lift out of the ground."
