    "The trail follows the river to the southeast, bending with the water's flow as it moves downstream.  Northward, a rocky ridge twenty feet high or so blocks progress.  The river appears to have carved its own passage through the rock, rushing and splashing rapidly as the raised land stands sentinel on both sides of the flow.  The trail moves inland to the northwest where it finds a way to ascend the ridge."
