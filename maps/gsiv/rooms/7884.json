    "Huge towering oaks have burst out of the ground making what must have been a quiet, solemn graveyard into the chaotic shambles that it is today.  Toppled markers, some still leaning against the trunks of the intruding trees, are the only clue that once, long ago, this field was a simple resting place for the dead."
