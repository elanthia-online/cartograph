    "A thick coat of dust covers everything in this rather dingy storeroom.  The area offers no clue to what it once housed, but it's apparent that spiders could be the current occupier, considering the intricate spiderweb covering the ceiling.  A sturdy wooden table sits smack dab in the center of the room."
