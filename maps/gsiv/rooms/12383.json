    "A stunning view of Kharam-Dzu spreads out below the ledge, the intricate play of the city's canyons and tunnels like a giant labyrinth.  Carved into the stone here is a simple troglodyte dwelling surrounded with flowering planters and a doorway trellis almost totally disguised by a prolific entwining cypress vine.  Small curtained windows display a variety of wares, beckoning customers to enter.",
