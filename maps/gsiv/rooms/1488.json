    "A small altar has been constructed here, made of wood from destroyed ships and decorated with chips of coral and tiny pearls.  Breakers wash over the monument, as if in reminder of whom it belongs to.  Very few offerings have been placed here, and the area shows signs of disuse.  A large barnacle-covered trident has been driven into the sand just behind the altar."
