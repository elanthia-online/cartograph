    "Spikes protrude outward from the crumbling stone walls that encircle the arena.  A thin layer of sand covers the cavern floor, which has been stained with blood and littered with debris.  Long shadows twist and turn, cast from the flickering fires high overhead, adding to the considerably oppressive atmosphere in the arena."
