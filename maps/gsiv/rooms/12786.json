    "The tunnel curves around an outcropping of granite.  In the low light, tiny flecks of mica embedded in the salmon-colored slabs composing the floor twinkle demurely.  A few wisps of ground fog drift along the corridor, their undersides tinted with a blush of ash rose reflected off the rock beneath them."
