    "Painted into the domed ceiling is a mosaic of the oceans and mists that surround the island, while below, a wall of aquariums is filled with a plethora of the local aquatic life.  Colored sunlight tickles the smooth diamond-shaped tiles that cover the floor, their source the wide windows that flank the steps leading out.",
    "Candles perched in high niches are shielded with blue sea glass globes that reflect the light in watery hues across the domed ceiling and mimic the rolling of waves as they flicker.  Below, a wall of aquariums is filled with a plethora of aquatic life local to the island.  Colored moonlight tickles the smooth diamond-shaped tiles that cover the floor, their source the wide windows that flank the steps leading out."
