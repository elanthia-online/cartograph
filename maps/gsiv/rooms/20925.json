    "Unusually dark sand, almost black in color, spreads out in all directions.  Whatever minerals spawned the night-hued grains, their properties combined to produce a unique landmark.  A high eastern promontory blended with a low northern shoreline make the sandbar's terrain equally unique.  Everywhere the island mist moves in waves as tidal as the ocean's currents.  The collected cloud of vapors hides most of the sea view, and oftentimes its shifting density obscures the jungle clearing to the west."
