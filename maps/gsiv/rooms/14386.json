  "description": [
    "A heavy granite slab dominates the northern wall, its mottled grey surface rough and unadorned.  Standing before the slab, a low altar at her feet, is a life-sized grey marble statue of a woman, her voluminous outstretched wings flowing up nearly to the ceiling then sloping down in a cascade of intricate feathers to her sides.  Rows of tall pillar candles cast the chamber in a dim, shifting glow, the wavering candlelight doing nothing to drive off the faint chill that pervades the utterly still air."
