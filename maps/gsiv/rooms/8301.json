  "description": [
    "This hut is dark and empty, save for a few beetles and scorpions scurrying along the floor, startled by your approach.  Tiny, dense cobwebs hang from the rafters that support the straw roof.  Strands of spider silk dangling from the low roof attach themselves persistently, almost malevolently, to your clothing.  You are not inclined to stay here for very long."
