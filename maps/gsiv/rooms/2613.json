    "The sky boils with dark black clouds.  Lightning flashes across the sky,  and wind howls across the barren landscape.  Within the clouds, you can see the form of a man, standing in the center of the tempest.  He stares down upon the ruins of an old shrine, where a man and woman huddle in a corner, cleaving to each other for comfort."
