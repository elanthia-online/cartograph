    "Leather-bound books neatly stacked on built-in shelves line the walls of this room.  Close to the window sits a scrivener's desk and tall chair, while a few small reading tables are fronted with leather chairs.  To one side, a dessert table holds a tray of drinks.  Two opposite walls of shelves are interrupted by a burled maple doorway and a set of double doors carved with fanciful figures from Elanthian history.  A dimly lit hallway leads deeper into the building."
