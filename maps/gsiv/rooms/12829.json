    "Cascading walls of water in colors of red, white, grey, green, and black enclose this translucent causeway.  A thin crystallized barrier keeps the water from rushing onto the concourse and completely destroying it.  Each different colored wall connects seamlessly to the adjoining one, without blurring the colors.  Prisms of light dance from one wall of color to the next then escape up into the sky."
