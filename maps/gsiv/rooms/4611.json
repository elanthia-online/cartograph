    "The edge of a conifer forest presents itself.  The trees thicken northward until they completely block the horizon.  To the south the landscape opens up to allow fields and pastures with only an occasional clump of trees to punctuate the scenery.  Smooth and dry, the cobblestone road provides easy passage in both directions, although here and there some of the cobblestones are missing, replaced by clumps of dark green weeds.",
