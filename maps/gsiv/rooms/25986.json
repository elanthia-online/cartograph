    "Covered with stone tiles, the floor of the entryway is a colorful mosaic depicting a rose pattern.  A mirrored coat rack stands next to a carved beechwood door, a reflection of the room echoed in the smooth glass.  Suspended from a silver chain, a large candelabra hangs above, illuminating the area.  A curtained archway covered with a rose-patterned carving dominates the west wall."
