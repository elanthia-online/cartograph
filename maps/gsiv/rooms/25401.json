  "description": [
    "The walls of the parlor are hung with indigo-colored velvet drapes in deep, rich folds that make the chamber seem more like it's an exotic tent retreat rather than a sitting room in a range of rugged mountains.  A couple of chairs flank a generous sofa, and a bar sits against the far wall offering refreshments.  On the sofa and chairs, a few white, lace-covered pillows add a splash of light to the room's deep blue, like stars in a night sky."
