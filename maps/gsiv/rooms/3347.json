    "A howl echoes in the distance, reverberating off the walls of the closely packed buildings, turning into something odd and eerie.  Strangely, loud drips are further amplified by the enclosed space, becoming loud pops and smacks instead of the light taps one would expect.  The light of the sun rarely reaches through the thick overgrowth of vines stretching overhead between buildings."
