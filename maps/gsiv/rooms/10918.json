    "The alley opens a bit to accommodate a vaulted gateway.  Its surface is covered with intricately carved swashes and fanciful creatures intertwined.  A carved plaque is positioned in the center of the embellishment, inscribed with calligraphy that is ornate yet still readable.  Huddled in the shadow of the gateway are a couple of doors, their surfaces as richly decorated.  To the northeast, the alley widens and crowds cloak the entrance, the milling figures haloed with moonlight.",
