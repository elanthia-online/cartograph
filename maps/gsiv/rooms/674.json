    "Two large oaks stand sentinel on either side of the widening trail, gentle keepers and old warriors.  Several dark red rosebushes grow around the bases of the trees, their tenacious arms winding around the trunks, cascading garnet-hued blooms overhead in drifting masses.  A sturdy treehouse has been built between the two oaks, spanning across the path.  A knotted rope dangles a few feet from the ground to the side of the path."
