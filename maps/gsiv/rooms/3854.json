  "description": [
    "The lamp on the table has been neatly trimmed, and casts a soft warm glow over the area.  Fluffy rolton fur cushions tied to the chairs create the impression that a flock of the sheep-like creatures has stopped by the Inn.  Painted on the table around the lamp is a circle of drowsy thraks, the head of one resting on the tail of the next."
