  "description": [
    "Naturally cool and in close proximity to the Hall, the buttery serves as a convenient storage space and food preparation area.  Barrels of wine and ale have been stacked against one wall and joints of meat and game hang from large iron hooks overhead.  A small, unglazed window is set high into the stone wall to allow for ventilation and a glimpse at the spruce and fir trees beyond."
