  "description": [
    "Rough planks of axe-hewn wood cover the walls of this small shadowed office.  An old carpet lies before a scarred wooden counter, the pattern unrecognizable.  Standing on uneven legs, a crude bench rests against the wall next to a broken crooked door.  Hanging from the far wall is a patchwork blanket sewn from sail material.  A rusted anchor stands in the corner, bits of coral still stuck to its surface."
