    "An ivy-covered riverstone lodge provides tranquil refuge in the darkness, light from its windows reflecting off the nearby towering silver lor tree and an eahnor-streaked waxing stone moon.  Across the clearing, a magnificent angel oak erupts from the ground, its many gnarled and twisted limbs embrace the glade, shielding it from the encroaching forest.  A braided hemp ladder hangs from the lor tree, and a glowbark dart board embellished with an astral rune is mounted on the oak."
