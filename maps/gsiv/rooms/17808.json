    "A drunk is sleeping one off, a large splintered crate apparently his home for the day.  The area is littered with empty wine bottles, most of such poor quality they aren't even labeled.",
    "A drunk sits within a large splintered crate, a bottle in one hand.  He is alternating between drinking and singing.  Clearly, he is not a member of the Bard's guild."
