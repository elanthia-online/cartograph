    "Dotted with a variety of small trees, thanot, wild boxwood, and other bushes, the top of the ridge affords a view of the entire island.  Ancient thanot bushes arc gracefully over the top of ornately carved sunset-hued stone benches that dot the edges of a small area set with carved paving stones.  Carved from local stone, a miniature of the island sits in the middle, the sunset colored rock casting the entire sculpture in a warm glow.",
    "Dotted with a variety of small trees, thanot, wild boxwood, and other bushes, the top of the ridge affords a pale moonlit view of the entire island.  Ancient thanot bushes arc gracefully over the top of ornately carved sunset-hued stone benches, each set with a subtle lantern, that dot the edges of a small area set with carved paving stones.  Carved from local stone, a miniature of the island sits in the middle, the sunset colored rock casting the entire sculpture in a warm glow."
