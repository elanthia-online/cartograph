    "A fountain flows into a large marble basin in the center of this airy courtyard, dimming the sounds of nearby training with its musical cascade.  Tall stands have been integrated into each wide flower bed, bearing a hanging lantern that serves to cast a gentle light over the tree-shaded grounds."
