  "description": [
    "Looping between support posts, heavily corded bright red rope forms a simple barrier between the open water and the edges of the wooden pier.  A pair of simple steps, with bright red letters painted in front of them proclaiming the area as \"Pier 4 - Slips 16-20,\" leads down to a small finger pier with five docking slips built into its seaward side.  A light and insistent seaborne breeze slips across the water and carries with it the thick scent of salt."
