  "description": [
    "This shadowed cleft in the cliff face widens as it cuts deeper into the rock.  Clever stone workers have taken advantage of the natural feature by carving a circular staircase into the rock chimney.  Reminiscent of the sound made by blowing across the neck of a wine bottle, deep whistling tones reverberate through the stone tube as occasional gusts of wind are funneled down the narrow opening.  Air moves up and down the chute as if the stone, itself, is breathing."
