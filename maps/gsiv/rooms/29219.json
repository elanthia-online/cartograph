  "description": [
    "Though only a scattering of sand and loose soil covers the flat stones of this outcropping, a few hardy plants have managed to gain a foothold.  Waving grasses dance in rhythm to the fluctuating breezes, and small, spindly saplings hoist themselves up out of soil-laden crevices to spread their budding greenery.  Upright and overlapped shelfae scales have been fashioned into tiny garden borders around a patch of blooming yellow and pink flowers."
