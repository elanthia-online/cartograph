    "Livelier than the other parts of this circular path, crowds come and go along the road to the east, where shouts of laughter and cries of recognition can be heard as people spy acquaintances amongst the crowd.  Heavy in the air is the smell of wood smoke and roasting meat, tempting to those famished after an arduous hunt."
