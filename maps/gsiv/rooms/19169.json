    "A massive glass-paneled aquarium stands against the wall of this cabin, stretching from the door of this room all the way through to meet itself on the other side of the location that it started its journey from.  The room is bare of everything else except the aquarium and a small halfling pirate who stands leaning against one of the four glass panes accessible from the inside of the room."
