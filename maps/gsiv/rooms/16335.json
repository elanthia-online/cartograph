    "The driftwood boards that make up the walls of this small shop have been strewn with lengths of colorful silks and satins, giving the room a bright patchwork feel.  Several sticks of incense have been lit around the area, blending the scents of magnolia, rose, and gardenia.  In the corner of the room, crates of pastel and jewel-tone yarns sit open, their contents spilling onto the floorboards below."
