  "description": [
    "Snow billows into a tall tunnel and drifts against the walls.  A few steps from the mouth, the cave opens out into a wide cavern that is taken up almost entirely by a huge nest.  Tree branches, entire bushes, and other debris have been crudely woven together to form a roughly circular structure that would stand chest high to a giant."
