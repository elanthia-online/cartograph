  "description": [
    "Panels made of a glossy silk, their surface rippling slightly with any passing breeze, enclose this small tent.  Set against one wall is a table with a branching metal jewelry tree and a velvet-lined ring box positioned neatly on top of it, while across from it is a glass-topped mahogany display counter.  Soft rugs made of textured cotton have been spread over the floor, muffling any footfalls within the space.  The subtle aroma of cinnamon and cloves permeates the air from a few discreetly placed candles."
