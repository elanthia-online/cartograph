  "description": [
    "Hawthorn trees ring the perimeter of this small garden, their crimson berry-like fruits bright against the dark glossy foliage.  Bushes of heliotrope have been pruned uniformly and sit squarely between each trunk.  Dark, loamy cultivated beds filled with the showy blossoms of nightshade, wolfsbane, mezereon and hellebore create an almost overwhelming perfume.  A small, grey granite statue in the center of this retreat serves as a focal point for meditation."
