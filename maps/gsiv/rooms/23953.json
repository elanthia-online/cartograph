    "Voices laughing, talking, and shouting create an additional layer to the hustle and bustle found here at the heart of the grounds as people pass by and through the rows of wagons and stalls.  The scent of pickle brine and fried foods drift through on the occasional breeze.",
    "A whisper of voices, talking, and quiet laughter can be heard here, the hustle and bustle of the day having been subdued by the night as fewer people pass by and through the rows of wagons and stalls.  Overhead, a myriad of fireflies and starflies dance together against the black of the black sky."
