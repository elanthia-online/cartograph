  "description": [
    "This cavern unfolds from the entry gate to rise high into the air, culminating with a curved stone ceiling.  A waterfall cascades down the cavern's center, splashing on a few plateaus before hitting a set of narrow stone steps and disappearing with them into a narrow fissure in the floor.  An ascending set of stairs carved into the rockface leads up beside the falls, and multihued toadstools in pots rest on the steps in even intervals.  Each toadstool reflects off small specks of mica in the walls, illuminating the cavern with a glittering rainbow."
