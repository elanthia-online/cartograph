  "description": [
    "The tracks of wagon wheels rut the path through here, forming tiny rivulets that connect the puddles.  A few sparse bushes and a tiny garden outside one of the shanties do little to relieve the monotony of the otherwise indistinguishable dwellings to the north and east.  The western path leads back to town."
