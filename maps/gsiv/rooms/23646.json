  "description": [
    "A row of doors lines the wide porch, their wood polished to a lustrous shine.  They face a patchwork panorama of red tile roofs crowning the thin houses characteristic of the Mews.  A door at the end of the porch sports a colorful sign over it, proclaiming it to be the local tavern, Tassel Grogs.  Music comes from inside, muted and soft but still merry."
