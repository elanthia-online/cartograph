    "Pewter framework creates the narrow outline of the stained glass window, which depicts the image of a smiling nymph as she paddles towards a distant island.  Tight corners and cramped spacing allows for very little movement along the redwood and teak catwalk, though narrow bands of light to the east offer the hope that the space opens up closer to the light."
