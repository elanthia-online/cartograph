    "[Good Mourning, Showroom]"

  "description": [
    "The interior of the store has been carefully crafted to resemble a funeral parlor.  Miniature replicas of coffins, hand-carved from a variety of different woods, are centered on pedestals around the perimeter of the showroom.  A male display area adorns the left side of the shop, and some carefully posed female mannequins decorate the right side.  An accessory table has been meticulously placed in the exact center of the room.  A dark doorway leads to a room in the back, and some double doors lead back to the outside."
