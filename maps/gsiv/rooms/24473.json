    "Ornately carved pillars punctuate each corner of this spacious library.  Students wander amongst the bookshelf-lined walls, their footsteps muffled by worn tapestry rugs covering the wood floor.  Sunlight filters in through a domed skylight in the ceiling, illuminating large antique tables.  Wrought iron railing borders a wide descending staircase in the center of the room.  On the north wall, an open doorway is flanked by an antique fel bookcase and a marble pedestal displaying a dark leather volume."
