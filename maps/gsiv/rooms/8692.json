    "A small group of people stands around a newly-covered grave here in the Temple's shadow.  A priest, dressed in solemn clothing, leads the people in a soft song.  While the key is minor, the words rejoice that the departed one now rests beyond the hardships of life, safe within Lorminstra's grasp."
