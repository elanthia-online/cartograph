    "A large striking modwir tree spreads across one wall, each leaf actually a small window of stained glass that allows a soft glow to settle over the room.  The light tinges the porcelain crucible a pale green, the color darker in the many pits and chips in the well-used vessel.  A glass alembic rests on a sturdy wooden workbench that takes up most of the workroom, the color complementing the grain of the wood."
