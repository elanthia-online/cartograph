    "Very little flesh remains on the bones that have drifted down to this area.  Still, hundreds of rats scrabble and claw through the bones in hopes of finding even a small piece of decomposing, gristly flesh to consume.  The rats dart from bone to bone, living a precarious existence as they attempt to find sustenance while avoiding the predatory undertaker bats.  Tempers flare as two rats fight over a bone each one wants, their battle punctuated by shrieks and squealings."
