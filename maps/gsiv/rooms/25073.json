    "Near the apex of the path's curvature, an ethereal lamp hung from a long iron post flickers heatlessly.  To the east, hollowed shouts can be heard, followed by a strange echo.  Empty suits of armor are stacked in a neat pile with a single blackened lance pinning them into the rough cobblestone pavers."
