    "A short wall of rough grey-blue stone lines the entire expanse of the courtyard.  Leading towards the carved haon door of the manor, some short boxwood hedges line the flagstone path.  Affixed to the wall of the rather imposing structure is a gilded plaque, and flowerbeds at the manor's base boast colorful batches of delphinium, dragonstalk, and bluebells.  Partially hidden by a large fern is a donation bin."
