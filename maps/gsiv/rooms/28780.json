    "Shining white frost beckons from the other side of a pale pine door with a frosted glass panel.  Heat bleeds from the hallway's dead end, hungrily leached from the air by the waiting outdoors.  On the walls, a series of bright-pigmented landscapes depict pastoral scenes that are green and refreshingly devoid of ice, framing the curve of a silver-inlaid smooth spruce archway that leads to the banquet hall."
