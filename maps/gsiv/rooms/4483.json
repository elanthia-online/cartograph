    "A stout miner pushing a nearly full wheelbarrow walks past, her attention fully on the load in front of her.  A glance in the wheelbarrow shows it to be mostly rocks with a few scattered semi-precious gems.  The quality of the stones is so poor however, a town jeweler probably wouldn't give the stones a second look."
