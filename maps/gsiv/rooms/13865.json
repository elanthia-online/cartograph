    "Beneath a dark and light oak ceiling, a fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the flimsy dark cloth walls.  A beveled glass-covered case and a heavy white granite counter sit in opposite corners while a plush black bear fur rug rests on a varnished dark oak floor.",
    "Beneath a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling, a fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls.  A beveled glass-covered case and a heavy white granite counter sit in opposite corners while a woven Vornavian silk rug rests on a varnished dark oak floor."
