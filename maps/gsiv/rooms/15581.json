    "A painted silk wall panel hangs on one of the plain baby blue walls, and a cerulean cloud-painted ceiling rises overhead.  A tarnished brass urn sits in one corner of an unfinished wooden floor.  There is a wide faenor-trimmed table on one side of the shop and a long mahogany rack on the other."
