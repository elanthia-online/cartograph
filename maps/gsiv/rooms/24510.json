    "A four-tapered snowy owl chandelier hangs above the stage of a small, intimate amphitheater, where a low granite table rests.  Walls draped in twilight blue velvet curve to create a semicircular room with built-in tiered seating formed by several levels of steep steps.  Lavish silver-tasseled embroidered cushions lay casually around the dark carpeted floor on all levels, while two narrow staircases down the sides of the room provide easy access to the stage.",
