    "Stone markers line either side of the well-defined path here, but any lettering on the markers has long since been worn away by the elements and the years.  In the distance to the north, the ruins of a shattered tower break the skyline.  Occasional cobblestones stick through the grass here, indicating that the path may have once been paved."
