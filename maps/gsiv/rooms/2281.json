    "Condensation coats the walls of this short tunnel.  The larger drops glitter in the darkness, acting as tiny prisms as they reflect the glow of torchlight from the south.  Roughly hewn stones litter the floor, and the ceiling hangs dangerously low.  A natural wall to the north blocks further travel in that direction."
