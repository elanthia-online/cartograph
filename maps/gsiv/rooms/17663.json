  "description": [
    "The heavy odor of grease and frying fish hangs over the narrow rectangular room set with several mismatching tables and chairs.  Salt-encrusted rope and netting decorate the walls, in addition to a large stuffed rat situated above the entrance.  Cracks in the floorboards reveal the sight of the rushing waters of the Tempest River, while a counter at the far end provides a place to order one's meal."
