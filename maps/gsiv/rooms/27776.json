    "Straps of thick, tanned hides hang from a rope situated behind a work counter.  An array of newly oiled leathers, freshly sharpened blades, and carefully polished shields lines the walls.  A stout halfling with particularly hairy bare feet hammers rhythmically at the misshapen slab of metal placed on an anvil beside him."
