    "Easily as large as the entire North Market, the plaza is paved with a spiral pattern of alternating terra-cotta and golden-yellow bricks.  On the eastern edge of the plaza stands an ornate, white limestone arch, and beyond it the brick-paved avenue stretches toward Vornavis' towering west wall.  A steady mix of merchants, artisans, and clerics pass through the arch in both directions.",
