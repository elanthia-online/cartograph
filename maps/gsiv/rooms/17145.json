    "Metal grating makes up the catwalk that encircles the guard station.  Overlooking the antechamber below, sentries armed with short-bows easily patrol the cellblocks from this strategic vantage point.  From behind thick, clear glass, other guards are plainly visible as they perform various duties, including the oftentimes tedious task of paperwork.  Rectangular slots run the perimeter of the glass.  The niches are just wide enough to allow arrows to be fired from behind the safety of the glass wall."
