    "Eight large round tents are set in the center of a clearing, formed into two lines and separated by three large bonfires.  Blue and buff banners fly from the top of every tent, occasionally snapping in the breezes of the night.  A large white tent is set slightly off to the side, and its entrance is flanked by two pike-wielding sentries wearing Torren armor.",
    "Eight large round tents are set in the center of a clearing, formed into two lines and separated by three large fire pits.  Blue and buff banners fly from the top of every tent, occasionally snapping on breezes from the bay.  A large white tent is set slightly off to the side, and its entrance is flanked by two pike-wielding sentries wearing Torren armor.",

    "Set in a clearing cut from the surrounding woods is a simple cemetery.  The graves are arranged in orderly lines and riverstones marked with the names of those who rest beneath them serve as plain headstones.  Nearby are barren spots in the earth, hardpacked and stained by an encampment in the past."
