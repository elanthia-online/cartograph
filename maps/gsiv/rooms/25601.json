  "description": [
    "The antechamber of the River's Rest Bard Guild is actually a closed porch.  It is constructed from heavily carved wooden screens on three sides.  The distinctively banded exterior of the three-story building provides the fourth wall, with alternating stripes of ochre and ivory stone providing a marked contrast to the near black of the wooden screens.  Set within a carved sill is an imposing door, its surface decorated with carving so fine and intricate, it would take hours to discover all its detail."
