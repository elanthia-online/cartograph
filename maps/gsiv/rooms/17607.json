    "The elegant walkway of the deck is crafted from handset fel planks polished to such a deep rich lustre that the nearby soft torchlight dances upon the surface.

Gleaming brass oil lanterns provide a romantic ambiance to the outer deck and the mood is further enhanced by the soothing sounds of the sea below."
