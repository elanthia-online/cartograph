    "Bundles of dried flowers cover the peeling walls, overwhelming the small space with the scent of jasmine and lavender.  The only reprieve from the stifling odor is a small hole in the ceiling that allows fresh air and natural light to filter in.  A rope ladder falls through the small hole and dangles above a low-set clothing rack.  Two mannequins, one male and one female, have been posed on the only seat in the wagon, their arms tangled together in an awkward embrace."
