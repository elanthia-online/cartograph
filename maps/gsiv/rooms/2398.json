    "Porter Street angles sharply towards the northeast here, in the direction of the Silvermule Gaming Hall.  A group of dwarves pushes past you on their way to the Silvermule, obviously intent upon furthering their riches.  Down the short lane heading south, you can just barely see the stone wall forming the border of the Trace."
