  "description": [
    "The office is small, but well-appointed in contrast to the rough stone of the building outside.  Rich paneling in a variety of exotic woods covers the walls, hung with fine tapestries and paintings from all corners of Elanthia.  A large polished ebony desk, carved around its edges with elaborate symbols of the Arkati, dominates the room."
