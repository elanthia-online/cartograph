    "Carpets in a variety of somber shades are tossed haphazardly across the floor.  Patterned in the center of each rug, in a brilliant gold thread, are interlocking spheres of assorted sizes.  Pushed against the wall of the chamber, holding an assortment of alchemical paraphernalia, stands a sturdy solid oak table.  Several clear-globed lanterns hang high overhead to provide adequate lighting for the various accoutrements available for purchase."
