    "Taking advantage of the span of beachfront to the north of the Beacon, a pristine cottage of wisteria-covered mistwood walls and bevelled window panes nestles at the north end of this cul-de-sac.  Where the ground around it does not sparkle with diamond white sand, it is dotted with patches of bluish-green sweetgrass.  Twin gold oil lamps frame the door, beckoning."
