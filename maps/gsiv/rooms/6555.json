    "The rough timber planks of this drawbridge must be at least two feet thick, and are obviously of great antiquity.  Here and there, the surface of the bridge is mottled with the green of mosses and the pale gold of lichens.  But the integrity of the heartwood appears to be unbreached, with not a crack or spot of rot to be seen.  Beneath it, the forbiddingly cold water of the lake ripples silently."
