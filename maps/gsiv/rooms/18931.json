  "description": [
    "Tiers of lattice benches encircle a small dais in this spacious amphitheater.  A matching lattice covering supported by sturdy bamboo poles extends over the entire area, filtering the moonlight while allowing a warm breeze to waft gently through.  The amphitheater appears to have been painstakingly carved from a massive limestone shelf.  Steps lead down from the main entrance to a pair of small steps at the north end of the dais.  Torches brightly illuminate the area from advantageous points."
