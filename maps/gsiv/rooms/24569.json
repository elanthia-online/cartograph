    "Eight ebonwood chairs surround a great round table of mithril-banded oak.  A round oak and iron wagon wheel set with sconces hangs from the center of the ceiling, keeping the office well-lit day and night.  The eastern wall is adorned with a bold tapestry hung just above an official-looking desk.  In a quiet corner of the office stands a small aquarium, the tropical fish milling about in their watery home, oblivious to the world around them."
