  "description": [
    "Alternating light and dark woods panel the bulkheads of the cabin.  On the deck is a thick piled rug, woven with an intricate image of a battle -- an apropos setting for the weaponry and armor on display in front of a large mural painted directly on the wall.  The bunk and any furnishings that would accommodate lodging here have been removed, making room for the business of commerce."
