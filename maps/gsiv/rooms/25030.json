    "A massive mechanical golem sits half-buried beneath a sinkhole of crimson-stained sand, its joints bleeding a thick oily substance that pools around its patinaed body.  Clenched firmly between its riveted hands are a pair of avian skeletons, each one caged within the golem's heavy metal fingers."
