    "Billowing in thick clouds, steam from the hot springs that surround the island obscures the forest beyond the gazebo's wide open windows.  Thick woolen pillows are scattered about the ground, offering a comfortable place to recline while enjoying the warmth that radiates from the brazier at the heart of the tiny structure.  A low oak table near the exit offers a small sampling of refreshments."
