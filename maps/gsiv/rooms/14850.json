    "Moonlight sparkles off of the silver fence in the few places not covered by ivy, and upon the surface of the tranquil lake in the distance.  Water burbles and sprays from an intricately carved marble fountain to the northwest, several silver coins visible beneath the surface.  The sound of someone singing a sorrowful dirge can be heard from somewhere nearby.",
