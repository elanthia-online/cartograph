    "Slightly raised above the canal's waters outside, this deep limestone cavern extends several hundred feet back before tapering to a rounded point.  Rows of polished ironwood benches with emerald green seat cushions and backs line either side of the wide aisle that leads to the dais at the cavern's pointed end.  Torches mounted high on the wall above each bench serve to illuminate the silver carpeting, the white limestone dais, and the huge banner that hangs from the cavern's ceiling."
