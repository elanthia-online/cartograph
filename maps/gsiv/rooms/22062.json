    "Lush crimson carpeting spreads over the grey and gold flecked marble floor.  A pair of high-backed chairs sits to the side of a wide staircase leading up to the second floor, a wide banister landing visible from below.  Sounds of merriment drift from a high teak archway draped with rich velvet curtains, while a large flowering plant tumbles out of a stoneware pot and creeps into the long hallway that leads away from the foyer."
