  "description": [
    "This small corner has been festively decorated with sketches of noses, illustrating a wide variety of shapes and sizes.  The cheeriness is broken, however, by the display of instruments used to achieve these many effects.  A chest full of neatly-rolled bandages and a basket of brown eggs sit at the ready."
