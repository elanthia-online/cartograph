  "description": [
    "Colorful rugs, many with complex tapestry patterns, line the wall from floor to ceiling -- not that the ceiling is very high, as this is, after all, the Spitfire.  At the very top of one pile, a striped grey kitten snoozes peacefully, content in her supremacy over the balding halfling standing far below.  Rungs have been nailed to the wall beside the rugs to assist the proprietor in reaching the top of the stacks."
