    "Winding away from the bustle of the busy Freeport, the stone walkway disappears under a driftwood gate.  A polished pewter-framed plaque is attached to one side of the entrance while a blackboard is hung on the other.  A vine-draped stone wall surrounds the garden beyond.  Tall verdant trees rise up from behind the barrier framing a beautiful manor house, the elegant greenery contrasting the stone and white washed facade."
