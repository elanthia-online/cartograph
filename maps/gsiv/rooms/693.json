    "The exterior wall of the Ta'Illistim Amphitheatre looms above, the tightly fitted stone blocks carved at regular intervals with fanciful carvings of sprites and faeries.  Sapphire blue banners edged in silver flutter atop the stone facade of the amphitheater.  A wooden cart stands nearby, its elven proprietor occasionally hawking her ices in a musical voice.",
    "The exterior wall of the Ta'Illistim Amphitheater looms above, the tightly fitted blocks carved at regular intervals with fanciful carvings of masked peacocks, some comedic and some dramatic.  Sapphire blue banners, edged in silver, flutter atop the curved facade of the amphitheater, which is covered in a silver-veined white marble cladding.",
