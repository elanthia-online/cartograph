    "On either side of a wide corridor are a series of pale driftwood doors spaced evenly apart.  Embroidered on the carpet below is an intricate representation of a merchant vessel sailing across the sea of silken fabric.  At the end of the hallway, an arched double-wide door sits open, its carved hardwood adorned with golden, flora-filled scrollwork."
