    "A line of slender trees to the west side of the avenue is bent almost double from the weight of fresh powder.  Massive clumps fall with a great crash when a heavy breeze knocks part of the mass loose, quickly replaced by yet more snow.  The windbreak holds back a good part of the brunt of storms racing across the landscape."
