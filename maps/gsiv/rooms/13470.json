    "The hillside is steep and dense stands of pines block most directions.  A few hardy dwellings brave the brisk winds and difficult terrain, their rooflines as lofty as the landscape.  As the trail edges through an obstacle course of boulders, its whole length is protected with rope and wood handrails, and the residences it connects are shored up with heavy pilings.  The view of the moonlit countryside is spectacular.",
