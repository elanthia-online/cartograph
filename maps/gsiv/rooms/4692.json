    "An ornate chandelier hangs above the bedroom's heart, suspended from a burnished sunburst medallion.  Large sunflowers rest in a smooth citrine-hued vase on the low night table set beside a tawny satin-covered bed.  Around a carved modwir door, stylized golden rays radiate out in all directions, splaying against the pale yellow wall."
