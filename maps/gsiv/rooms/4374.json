    "Along the jagged cavern walls of this expansive shop hang the mounted heads of various exotic creatures, each one staring ahead with a blank expression.  A thick striped fur rug stretches across the dusty floor, while unusual animal skins hang from hooks about the shop, waiting their turn to be tanned.  Postured about the room are candle pedestals of various heights, allowing the yellowish light to illuminate the many wares for sale."
