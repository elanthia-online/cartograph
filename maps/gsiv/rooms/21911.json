    "A thick haze of smoke forms rings near the apex of the tent and a strong mix of scented aromas permeate in the area.  A row of wax-stained tables form a large circle in the center of the tent, each setup with a number of candles or incense.  Along the walls of the tent runs a line of curved wooden shelves.  A narrow slit in the tent's ceiling allows some of the fragrant smog to leak out."
