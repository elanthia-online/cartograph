    "Thick, brightly colored paint brings some life to an otherwise unremarkable shed situated between two homes on the south side of the road.  Stars ranging in size from tiny to an entire wall cover the exterior of the building, meeting at a waning sliver of a moon on the front.  A stack caps the roof, thick black smoking belching out of it."
