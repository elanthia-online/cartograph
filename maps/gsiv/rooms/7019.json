    "You are standing atop the southernmost of the two towers which flank the entrance to the outer keep.  A large drum wound with chain rests here, apparently to control the motion of the inner portcullis, but you see no way to manipulate the mechanism.  A thin plank of wood connects this tower to its twin to the north."
