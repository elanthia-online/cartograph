  "description": [
    "The scurrying of unseen creatures occassionally cause the snapping of a tiny twig and you oft times catch the glimpse of brown fur or black feather.  The dense and low-lying flora of the area quickly conceal anything that is not directly on the path however and you are feeling a bit apprehensive about moving further."
