    "Water from a southerly stream collects into a stagnant marsh, trickling in slowly.  An abundance of reeds, ferns, and other water plants line the soaked ground, providing cover and burrow space to insects and lizards.  The muddy pool is coated with a layer of green, mossy algae.  Colorful water flowers stand out around the outskirts of the wetlands, a bright contrast to the overall brown and green hues."
