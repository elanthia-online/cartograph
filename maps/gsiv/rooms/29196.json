  "description": [
    "The rocks here are jagged and sharp, unlike the rounded pebbles further up the beach.  Colored in shades of white, grey, brown, yellow, and tan, each rasp-edged stone seems to have been placed to inflict the most pain on the soles of one's feet, making heavy boots a must here.  Long tubules of bull kelp have wrapped themselves around the pilings, along with a few spiny-topped sea stars."
