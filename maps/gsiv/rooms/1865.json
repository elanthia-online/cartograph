    "Empty of people and void of buildings, this quiet stretch of road seems a perfect place to stop for a moment and forget the hectic bustle of life.  Supple canver trees bend inward, their crowns twining together in a lush green arch over the street.  Clumps of flowers gaze down from among the branches.",
