    "A large embankment of rock prevents further travel around the glaes pillar to the south for anything that can't rely on wings to carry it.  Sound is muffled, leaving only the omnipresent hum of wasps and the low hiss of magma pools.  The huge glaes stella blocks most wind movement, leaving its lee occluded with smoke from the bubbling lava."
