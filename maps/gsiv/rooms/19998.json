    "There is a large stone outcropping partially blocking the passageway here.  The surfaces of the stones to either side are worn smooth by the friction of many bodies squeezing through here over time.  There is evidence of a half-hearted attempt to widen the passage here, indicated by scars to one side on the face of the outcropping, but the endeavor was obviously abandoned."
