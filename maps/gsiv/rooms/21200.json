    "Burning brightly in its bracket, a single torch provides enough illumination to see the various tunnels that branch off from this small nexus.  Packed dirt walls, floor, and ceiling make the change from the regular sewer system noticeable, while several surrounding lidless barrels appear to be filled with dirt.  A long wooden crate rests on its side, its top covered with a simple cloth."
