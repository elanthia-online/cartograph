  "description": [
    "A thick layer of rough brush and weeds covers the long-fallow field, becoming thicker near the old stone wall which borders its western edge.  Narrow, well-worn trails have been worn into the vegetation in several directions, the matted grass and weeds charred in patches and even still smoldering here and there."
