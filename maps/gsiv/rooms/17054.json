    "Huge trees loom over silver-trimmed ebonwood benches that are placed here and there in pairs, with their thick foliage blocking all but faint slivers of moonlight from touching the ground.  A peaked obsidian arch flanked by two guards gives entrance to the temple itself, and a stone-walled koi pond sits in one corner."
