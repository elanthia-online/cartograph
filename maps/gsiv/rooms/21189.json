    "Bright and flickering, golden candlelight illuminates every inch of the nexus and dispels all shadows.  Smooth cobblestone walls rise into a domed ceiling that is incredibly distant from the uneven floor.  Training dummies and training mannequins are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circular room, though each is pulled far enough away from the wall to prevent candles that are perched on the high shelf from dripping on them.  Several entries provide a means of egress but only a brick-lined tunnel leads up."
