    "Primroses compete with ferns alongside the trail, as it meanders beneath a grove of red alder trees.  Their ovate leaves flutter in a teasing breeze which sets them to shimmering in the gentle light.  Cabins sit in the crevices between branching trails, the paths leading to their doors edged with more of the colorful primroses."
