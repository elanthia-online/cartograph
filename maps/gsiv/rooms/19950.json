    "Surrounded by darkly paneled walls, this second-floor lobby mimics the opulence of the one below with its expansive marble floor and intricately painted ceiling.  Hallways lead to the east and west, while a neatly printed sign directing visitors to their destinations rests near an expansive staircase.  Across from the landing, a mahogany arch with a bas-relief floral design leads to the north.",
