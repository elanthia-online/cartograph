    "As the trees thin out, moonlight flashes upon the still water of Lake Eonak.  The silhouette of Melgorehn's Reach rises suddenly, like a watchtower guarding the port of Wehnimer's Landing.  To the southwest, the gloomy spires of Darkstone Castle are backlit with a ghostly hue.",
    "As the trees thin out, commanding views open up on all sides.  Flashes of silvery blue from Lake Eonak can be glimpsed, among with the verdant colors of forest and meadow.  Melgorehn's Reach rises suddenly, like a watchtower guarding the port of Wehnimer's Landing.  To the southwest, the gloomy spires of Darkstone Castle can be seen."
