    "The eastern wall tilts back sharply, one segment breaking away from the main section, to create a crude obelisk.  Wider here than anyplace else along the alley, and more open to the sky above, the residents have created a circular garden area where they can relax away from the bustle of more populated streets.  The soft gurgle of a small fountain lends a soothing hush to the surroundings.",
