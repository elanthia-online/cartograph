    "[A Steep Trail]"

  "description": [
    "The icy air grows thin at this altitude, making any exertion difficult.  High above, the trail opens out onto a wide, snow-blanketed plain.  A lone fir tree climbs precariously to the trail side, bent close to the ground from years of pummeling by the deadly winter winds.  Nestled against the mountain, a dark tower stands within the shadow of the peak like a spectral sentinel watching the trail."
