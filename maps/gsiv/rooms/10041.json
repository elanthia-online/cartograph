    "The blackened plain extends off into the mist, the rough ground and scattered rocks scorched by some long-ago evil.  The ever-present mist crawls like a moving carpet along the cold ground, shifting to reveal dark patches of scrub and a few skeletal trees that stand like ghastly sentinels under the grey sky.",
