    "Empty stalls, vacated booths, and unfilled vegetable stands line both sides of the lane outside the plaza, remnants of a once-grand bazaar.  Laying in the middle of the cobblestones is a painted tin can next to a pair of forgotten sticks.  Carts and wagons, with no beasts to pull them, are parked in an open, grassy patch to the south."
