    "The rushing water of the river outside can be clearly heard in this odd little cave, in fact it seems to ricochet and magnify itself through the strange shape of the cavern.  Some small amount of moonlight makes its way past the boulder providing a bit of illumination here.  Concentrating through the deafening noise, you notice that leading from this cavern are two tunnels, both leading steeply down underneath the town.",
