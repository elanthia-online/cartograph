    "The water rushes in from the east and is presented with a decision.  The tunnel forks.  One path leads northwest, and another leads southwest.  The water slams against the western wall, spraying and churning, then makes its decision and races off to the northwest, leaving the southwestern tunnel awash in an undisturbed pool of green water."
