    "[A Thin-Striped Violet Silk Tent]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Airy and light, the silk walls of the tent enclosing this area stir with the slightest breeze, and the peaked roof overhead is vented to allow in shafts of natural illumination to brighten the interior.  A thick carpet overlays the ground, creating an even surface for the display at its heart that supports a slender jewelry case and a set of narrow shelves."
