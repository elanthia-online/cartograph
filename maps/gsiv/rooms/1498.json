  "description": [
    "A crew of labourers, wearing grey Mercantylers' Guild tunics, work determinedly to replace the bevelled timber that mates South 'Haven's platform to the solid ground along its northeast edge.  West of them, the wooden manor houses along Grebe Lane strive to mimic their larger cousins to the northeast, but their high wooden fences stand mere feet from them."
