  "description": [
    "The trail loops back on itself, turned by a thick stand of pines.  Cottages cluster to either side, their roofs carpeted with a thick mantle of long needles.  Drifts of snow rise on either side of the trail, and a deep bank is piled up at the start of the heavy forest, as if the precipitation is trying to invade the rough-barked shield wall of the woods."
