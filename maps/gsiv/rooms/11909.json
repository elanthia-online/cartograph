    "Tall, moss-covered modwir rub shoulders with lush, green oak on the slopes bordering both sides of the road.  An occasional glimpse through the curtain of trees up the northern slope reveals a path paralleling a wide river.  To the west you can see a break in the trees where the trail turns to march down the hillside below."
