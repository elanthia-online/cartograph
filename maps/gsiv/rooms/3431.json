  "description": [
    "The high-ceilinged foyer is paved with royal blue and white marble tiles flecked with silver.  A clerk smiles from behind a silver teller's cage and exchanges pleasantries with the guests.  Some topiary, trimmed carefully into the shapes of spades and hearts, stands on either side of the arched doorways leading east and west."
