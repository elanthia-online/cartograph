    "This short section of the hallway has dark oak-paneled walls and a pale marble floor striated with crimson.  In the center of the floor, a carved monir cockatrice statue is displayed on a circular silver base, adjacent to a small translucent block that sits on a carved oak pedestal.  On the western wall, an expansive watercolor painting obscures the oak paneling, while a panoramic oil-painted landscape encompasses the wall opposite."
