    "A long fissure cuts across the pass in a diagonal slant, from wall to wall.  Although no greater than half a foot in length, the fissure appears to be quite deep, its interior lost in darkness.  Easily bypassed by a simple lengthy stride, the fissure may attest to the unstable nature of the mountain."
