    "[Broken Ship's Door Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A broken ship's cabin door sits atop five uneven driftwood legs to make a rickety table.  Painted on the door is a boat with a ragtag halfling at the helm barking orders to a stuffed toy crew.  The young girl seems unconcerned that her ship is aground in a sunlit glade or that a group of forest gnomes is watching her from the trees nearby.  Someone has scribbled \"Sophie\" on an unframed picture of a hermit crab that is tacked to the wall above the table."
