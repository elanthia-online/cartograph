    "Small clusters of colored orbs clinging to the walls beneath the dark arched windows cast the alcove in soft azure and austere white light.  The polished surface of the mistwood table in the center of the small room gleams with silver highlights, and the velvety cushioning of the two armchairs positioned around it shimmers faintly with a pale blue sheen.  A plush tapestry rug covers the floor with white wisps and deep blue swirls separated by bright platinum threads.",
