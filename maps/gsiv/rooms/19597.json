    "Pale pink and white petals lightly rain upon the cobblestone pathway from the ancient limbs of a dogwood tree that rises from one corner of the garden.  A raised platform, polished to glitter brightly in the golden sunlight, spreads from flowerbed to flowerbed to create a charming outdoor dancing space, while sea glass charms strung from skeins of silk dangle beside dormant lanterns above.",
