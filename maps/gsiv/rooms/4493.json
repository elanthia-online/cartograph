    "This tiny room is bare of any decoration and immaculately swept.  A long mahogany table is the only furniture of note, save a ceiling-high stack of packing crates.  Each time a customer purchases the item displayed on the table, the clerk rushes to replace it with a new specimen from the crates.  Browsers and purchasers alike make their way in and out of the room via a heavy hide curtain suspended from an oak-framed arch."
