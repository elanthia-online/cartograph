  "description": [
    "The floors are a bit stained and there are visible signs of rot along the corners.  Apparently, this place has been flooded more than once.  Yet despite the signs of wear business continues.  Several young dwarves walk back and forth delivering or removing large piles of papers from the clerk's desks.  The clerks simply nod, remaining engrossed in their job."
