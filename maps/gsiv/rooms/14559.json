    "A shallow, oval-shaped water hole can be seen in the distance, large herds of velnalin, antelope, wildebeest and zebra congregating around its sides.  The sparse groundcover has been stamped down beneath the constant traffic of heavy, hoofed feet, and the dirt-covered ground is so dry it has cracked into angular plates."
