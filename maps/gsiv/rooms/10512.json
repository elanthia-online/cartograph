    "As one of the moons pokes its face through the clouds, a dozen bald cypress trees encircling an ancient burial ground come into view.  A multitude of stone caskets are scattered around the cemetery.  None of the stone caskets bears any marking to tell the tale of its occupant.  Some of the tombs lay wide open, as their covers have broken down to nothing more than dust and pebbles over the years.",
    "Small clusters of islets surround a larger piece of land upon which a dozen bald cypress trees encircle an ancient burial ground.  A multitude of stone caskets are scattered around the cemetery.  None of the stone caskets bears any marking to tell the tale of its occupant.  Perhaps they once did, but exposure to the elements for countless years has long since destroyed them.  Some of the tombs lay wide open, as their covers have broken down to nothing more than dust and pebbles over the years."
