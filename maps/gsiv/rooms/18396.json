    "Red cedar beams support a high ceiling that is patched up with misplaced pieces of colorful gates and doors over the slightest warping.  Bolts of pale-colored fabrics stand behind a marble-topped yew corner counter filled with small trinkets and accessories.  A hanging clothing rack and a carved mahogany shoe ledge run the full length of the store."
