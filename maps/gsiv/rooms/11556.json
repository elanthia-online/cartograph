    "The narrow inlet is sheltered from the large swells and waves of Maelstrom Bay by a rocky reef.  The beach is comprised of small black and grey stones.  The gentle action of the waves washing up on the beach creates a continuous rattle as the stones abrade each other.  Moonlight glints off the stony beach, making it seem to sparkle.  Tall bluffs and cliffs rise to the east.  A much-battered ship...a carrack of krolvin design...is careened awkwardly on the beach.",
