    "The floor, ceiling and walls of this room have all been covered with iron plating to keep this room at a very frigid temperature.  Large chunks of ice litter the floor with crates of goods stacked between them.  Large flanks of meat hang from heavy iron hooks along the walls of the room.  As you look closer at the flanks, you notice that one of them is an ice-covered body."
