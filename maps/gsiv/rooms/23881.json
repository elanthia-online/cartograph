    "Polished wooden walls and shelves give this cabin an ambiance that promotes lingering to examine the merchandise.  A long marble-topped counter, crafted of the same well-polished oak as the floor-to-ceiling shelves, cuts off the cabin's back half.  Behind the counter, a canvas flap presumably leads into the back of the shop, and an occasional raised voice from behind it gives more weight to the assumption."
