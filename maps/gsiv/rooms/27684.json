    "Draped with rich blue tapestries and adorned with lavish gifts from officials, diplomats, and royals from across Elanthia, this office serves as the bustling hub for international issues and peacekeeping efforts.  An expansive cedar bookcase stands behind a sprawling polished desk, and a plush blue velvet wing chair for guests has been placed near a small scale model of the Icemulian temple.  A wide exit framed in soft silver curtains drawn back with deep blue cords leads out to the corridor."
