    "A warm pool of light fills the area, kindly supplied by a pair of torches that appear to have been freshly placed.  The bright eyes of forest creatures can be seen reflecting the light of the torches off in the woods.  In the ample light it is not very difficult to spot a path that runs along the base of the oak."
