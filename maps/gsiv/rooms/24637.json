  "description": [
    "Silken walls of pale green brush against a slender ivory statue.  Composed of elaborately chiseled white ivory, a slender elven maiden attired in a sideless gown worn over a laced cotehardie is caught mid-step, her emerald-inset eyes twinkling from behind a golden mask that obscures the upper half of her otherwise reserved expression.  Opposite the masked maiden, a rose-carved ivory armoire is propped open."
