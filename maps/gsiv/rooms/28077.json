    "The noise of the outside world seems to fall away within the confines of this simple, serene tent.  Amid walls of unadorned raw silk, runestaffs hang on display from a simple teak rack and a series of bamboo hooks hanging from the tent's ceiling.  Beside the runestaffs, a finely inked parchment calls your attention."
