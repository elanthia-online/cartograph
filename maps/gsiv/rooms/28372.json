    "Pale alabaster glistens everywhere atop this slender edifice, almost painful in its brilliance.  Directly south, a sparkling lake spreads across the shallow valley, patches of fog drifting across it like clouds sailing across a peaceful sky.  In the center of the tower rests a simple white marble altar, untouched by carvings or decoration, save for two slender white candles on either side of a large tome bound in silvery-white eonake."
