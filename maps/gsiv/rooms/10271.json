    "Coral berry shrubs blanket the ground with nearly four feet of evergreen leaves and tiny yellow flowers.  Pushing through the dense cover, you are surrounded by a faint perfume that rises from the dark red, waxy berries crushed by every footstep.  To the northeast stands a grove of trees, their spindly trunks bound up like bundled kindling by thick, twining vines."
