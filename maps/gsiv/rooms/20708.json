    "Carpeted by a muted burgundy woven rug, the small patch of solid ground here at the top of the stairs is bordered by a rosewood-paneled wall that boasts a curved ebonwood arch, a pale linden door, and a curved golden doorway.  Through the former, the mingling scents of tobacco and alcohol exude in an invisible cloud.  Flanking the doors are two ensconced gold oil lanterns that easily illuminate the small space."
