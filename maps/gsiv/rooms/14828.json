    "Carved into the solid rock walls, deep shelves surround this small area and hold many glass jars of dye.  A crude torch that provides soft, golden light is fastened to the wall by large iron brackets.  Rusted nails and wooden splinters litter one corner of the room where a broom and dustbin lie."
