    "A half circle of high-backed chairs faces a pale stone fireplace, which dominates an entire wall of the great room.  Mounted high on the wall is the head of a giant red bear, its eyes hollow and dark while its razor-sharp fangs glisten with the faintest of light.  Banners hang from the vaulted ceiling, depicting each of the Giant clans."
