    "An incredibly tangled assortment of copper pipes covers the ceiling of the wagon.  Some of the metal tubes pierce the sides and roof, vanishing through the wooden walls only to reappear in other places.  Many of the pipes connect to the glass cylinder in the middle of the wagon, feeding into its top, and dripping colorful liquid into various segments of the cylinder itself.  A large, polished mithril vat sits beneath the cylinder, containing an assortment of colorful liquids."
