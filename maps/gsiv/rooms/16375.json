    "Stacks of wooden benches and driftwood chairs line the side walls, rising up toward the sea grass ceiling.  Along the back wall, a makeshift beach scene display has been created, complete with sand and seashells.  Placed along the display are various beach chairs and loungers, each covered in a bright-colored fabric.  In the center of the room is a row of sofas and armchairs, browsing customers seated in each to test its plushness."
