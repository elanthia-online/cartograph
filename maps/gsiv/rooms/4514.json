    "Stone walls smoothed over by both tools and time form a large cavern, however, little of the walls remain visible.  Polished teak plaques adorn the walls, covering most of the stone.  Each plaque has been decorated with at least one oversized weapon, some far to large in size to be of any practical use to anyone.  A bright green runner lines the floor leading off deeper into the cave."
