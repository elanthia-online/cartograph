    "To the north of the clearing stands a long, decorative stone wall crafted from grey and brown native stone.  The wall is barely tall enough to deter a halfling child at its westernmost end but it grows in height as it progresses eastward, where it joins a larger wall of formidable proportions.  The thick green grass in the clearing is cropped close to the ground, as though some sheep-like creature has been grazing on it."
