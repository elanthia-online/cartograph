  "description": [
    "Shelving and cabinets crammed with tomes and scrolls of all shapes and sizes take up every available inch along the smooth, lacquered walls.  Luminous candles cast reflections off of the glossy top of a curved cherrywood desk that manages to fit in the very center of this accumulation of knowledge.  A luxurious, silk cushioned chair is wedged between the desk and a massive wooden bookcase along the northern wall.  Occasionally, soft notes drift among the stacks through the narrow ebony archway."
