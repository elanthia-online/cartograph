    "The roadway stretches straight and true to the northwest and southeast.  The thick forest on either side diverts the wind upward, creating a still pocket of heavy, foggy air.  It is like walking through a cloud.  The damp air chills everything around it, but it also coats the trees with a gleaming white frost, turning the conifers into beautiful, fragile, crystalline statues.  A hush pervades the area as if a sound might make the entire splendor collapse into ice fragments."
