    "Large windows stand to either side of the shop's entry, each displaying different mannequins dressed in the latest fashions.  The glass-front display cases stand in the center of the room, their mirror-finished shelves displaying various wares.  Tiers of candles line the back wall around an ivy-painted arch, while two corridors lead into different sections of the shop.",
    "Two driftwood-framed windows stand to either side of the entry, each displaying a mannequin dressed in the latest fashions.  Several display cases reside in the center of the room, the gems and jewelry pieces in each are illuminated by a lustrous chandelier that hangs from the slightly raised ceiling.  Two corridors lead into different sections of the shop, and between them, an ivy-painted arch is flanked by potted palms that lend their exotic scents to the room."
