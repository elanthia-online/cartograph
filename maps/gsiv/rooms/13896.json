    "Lifting back the leather curtain, you enter the furrier's workroom.  Scraps of pelts, untanned hides, and tools for scraping, dressing and joining skins are spread across a workbench.  Several stools with rush seats are pushed up against the wall.  A half-finished rabbitskin robe is draped across one of the stools."
