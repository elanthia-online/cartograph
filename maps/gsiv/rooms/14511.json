    "Two completely different landscapes are bisected by the winding zoo path, contained within thick iron fences.  A snowy hill stands behind a frozen field, the chill white terrain serving as home for an arctic manticore.  Across the way, conifers intermingle with young yew and haon, while the distinctive sap of the tanik pervades the exquisite replica of the three-toed tegu's natural habitat."
