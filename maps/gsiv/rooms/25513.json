  "description": [
    "Rising above the ship's upper deck, but not so high as the towering metal blade assemblies that propel the craft and hold it aloft, the forecastle is a swathe of space shaped like an arrowhead, tapering to a point at the bow.  The gilded and burled railing, all wrought of ash-colored fireleaf, joins with the carved bowsprit at the absolute fore of the vessel.  To the rear of the deck, broad wooden stairs proceed down toward the upper deck."
