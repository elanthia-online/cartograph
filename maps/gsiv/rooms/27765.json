    "The pathway bends here in a smooth curve.  The foot traffic must be heavier as visitors pause to admire a small garden of flora native to Icemule.  An angular pattern of artic moss-covered rocks separates the northwest section of the path, where a snow-covered dirt garden boasts colorful calmintha interspersed with clusters of winter roses, bright ice tulips, moonflowers of varying hues, and the occasional sassafras leaf."
