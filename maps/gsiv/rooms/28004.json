    "Pleated and heavy, voluminous canvas walls of alternating azure and plum panels are held aloft by a thick frame of welded wrought iron.  Small nooks with tables and chairs are sheltered by painted screens of rice paper and bamboo and tucked against the edges of a large teak and linden floor.  Candles burn within glass jars that are suspended from the rafters, while dozens of pot-bellied ceramic stoves fill the space with cozy warmth."
