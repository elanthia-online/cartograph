    "The natural stone ceiling overhead slopes down into a narrow corridor.  Nestled into the wall is an iron-bound door surrounded by slender veins of black and white minerals running up the surface of the stone.  A cylindrical skylight is carved vertically into the stone, offering limited amounts of lighting.  Stretching from wall to wall is a plush black rug peppered with embroidered snowflakes."
