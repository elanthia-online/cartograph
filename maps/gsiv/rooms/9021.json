    "Wider than the other courtyards along this twisting passageway, due to the proximity of Vornavis' western wall, this sanctuary boasts a large grassy area for rest and for play.  Slightly better maintained, the buildings that ring the tiny park feature windows with shutters and awnings, a sure sign of prosperity."
