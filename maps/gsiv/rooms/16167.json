    "Stacks of crates and barrels create a sort of crooked pathway that snakes throughout the room.  Made of pale-colored oak, a squat but sturdy counter is crowded with an assortment of odds and ends.  With her arms folded across her chest, the warehouse manager keeps a watchful eye on everyone and everything in the storage room."
