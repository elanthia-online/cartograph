    "Every ancient tapestry lining this hall has been torn into long tatters, which sway and twist drunkenly with even the ghost of a breeze.  To the east, the walls have caved and crumbled, with jagged timbers spiking like the points of a morning star from the impenetrable heap of rubble.  A dreamlike quality possesses the place, induced by the eye-stinging yellow haze that fills the ruined hall."
