    "This small warehouse has been piled to the rafters with a variety of barrels and crates that look to contain an endless variety of goods from many ports -- everything from spices to bolts of cloth to fine brandies to scrap metal and dried oats seems to be stored here.  An open area has been cleared to the west."
