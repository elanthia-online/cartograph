    "Trailing designs of creeping stone ivy decorate the walls of a small cabin located on-deck, and triangular windows trimmed in ornate crimson eahnor allow one to gaze unhindered at the surroundings from within.  Well-polished mahogany railings guard against any plunge below, their surfaces chased with delicate, twining patterns of mute green-grey hue."
