    "The airy retreat features a small sleeping alcove, curtained with gauzy spidersilk, that looks out on a room painted realistically to resemble the canopy of a forest.  Overhead, a large round opening lets in the daylight, the rendered tree tops arching to meet the sky.  Off to the side, a cage filled with a couple of love birds dangles over a small rock-lined waterfall that functions as a bathing area.  A large window leads out to a tiny balcony.",
