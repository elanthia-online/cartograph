    "An enormous brick forge occupies the center of a barren courtyard, fed by a triad of bellows manned by laboring apprentices.  Scattered among the coals are a number of brightly glowing incarnadine crystals that pulse with each gust of air.  Some charred ceramic crucibles stand in a lopsided pile near a long wooden trough filled with stagnant water, and chunks of ore and melted slag are scattered around the courtyard in large heaps.  On one side of the courtyard, a rusty iron water pump drips slowly into a deep moss-covered well.",
