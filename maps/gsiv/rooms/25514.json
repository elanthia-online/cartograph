    "Covered by an arced ceiling of transparent glaes, the sternmost portion of the upper deck is shielded from the elements.  Several chairs and tables laze underneath the faceted dome, forming a small enclave away from the bustle of the rest of the ship.  Some smooth wooden stairs form a wide path up to the smaller quarterdeck."
