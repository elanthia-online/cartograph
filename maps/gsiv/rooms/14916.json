    "The trail splits here, crossing over the creek by way of an arrangement of small stepping stones, framing the shallow sloping banks hiding under bordering trees.  Wintergreen and watercress grow in abundance amid the thick moss buffering the twin shores.  The outer trail continues under the riparian tunnel ringing the canyon, while the inner trail moves off towards Archer Falls."
