  "description": [
    "The scarred and buckled ground slopes sharply to the north and west, forming a narrow path around an inky, stagnant pond.  The dense forest grows to the edge of the pond, where thick moss-covered roots disappear into the rancid water.  The path is muddy and slick where it crosses over the large roots."
