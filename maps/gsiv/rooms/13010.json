    "Although the ceiling is high, it is difficult to see its painted surface due to the roof models hung from above.  Bright sunlight filters through the tall windows, illuminating silvery flecks in the pale grey-blue granite flooring.",
    "The roof displays hang lower than during the day, due to the necessity of chandeliers to illuminate the area.  Odd shadows are cast in pools, each one defined in part by the model above, while modified to irregular dimensions by the candelabra below."
