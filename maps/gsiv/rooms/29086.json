  "description": [
    "Roughly hewn logs protect the northern edge of the parapet, while also providing an unobstructed view of Widowmaker Road as it cuts its way along the edge of the Great Cliff.  Sturdy oak railings to the south offer protection from a spill into the mud below, their posts fitted with brightly burning torches.  A circular platform occupies a space beneath a shingled roof towards the east, while directly south is a sheltered ballista."
