    "Surrounded by kelp, a silver-veined pale blue marble bench is set securely into the drowned decking, its visible surface clearly revealing its elven origins.  Extending in a well-defined and gracious sweep, the starboard promenade marches forward along the perimeter of the main deck toward the sunken bow of the ship, while shallow steps ascend to the forecastle at the stern.  Over the railing, a large anchor is buried in the sea floor alongside the Wavedancer."
