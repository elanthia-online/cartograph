    "The canvas walls of this dilapidated tent give very little refuge from the outside.  In fact, one wall has such a large tear in it that it probably shouldn't even be called a wall.  Near the corner, a small tunnel is protected by large crabs.  The floor is nothing but sand and rock and covered mostly with the blacksmith's supplies."
