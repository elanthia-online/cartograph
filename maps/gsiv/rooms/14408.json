  "description": [
    "Carpeted by dense growth of wildflowers and tall grasses, the air above the blossoms is filled with fluttering butterflies, buzzing bees and darting of swallows, flycatchers and sparrows.  Outcroppings of rock allow for various sizes and heights of resting places, and a small oak tree provides an ample amount of shade."
