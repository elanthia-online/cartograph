    "The smell of unwashed bodies is strong and sharp in the tent, commingling with the acridity of hardened rolton hide from the walls.  Leaning on a small fel sign, a conductor wearing a dark bowler hat raises her voice above the stinking din, shouting out orders as wagons creak in the near distance."
