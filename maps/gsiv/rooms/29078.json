    "Exposed oak framework lends the entry a rustic look, while bright white stucco walls help to brighten the space.  Following the line of the eastern wall, an ascending staircase leads to the loft-like second story and has a small welcome mat placed before its bottommost step.  A polished copper mirror is affixed to the western wall, which leads to a small kitchen, where a half-circle wooden table filled with cleaning supplies rests."
