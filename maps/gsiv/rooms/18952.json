    "Moonlight bathes this redwood deck, coolly illuminating the chairs and recliners scattered across the plank surface.  Torches inset in the deck blaze brightly, trying to offset the moon's coolness with their warmth.  The waters of the bay serenely lap at the beach directly below, and a soft, warm breeze blows gently over the deck.  Several red, black and silver umbrellas stand or lean at various points, no longer needed now that the sun has retreated for the night.",
    "Sunlight bathes this redwood deck, warming the chairs and recliners scattered across the plank surface.  The waters of the bay serenely lap at the beach directly below, and seagulls wheel lazily, eying the water in anticipation of the next meal.  Several red, black and silver umbrellas stand or lean at various points on the deck, shading those who disdain exposure to the sun.  Torches inset in the deck railing quietly await the coming night."
