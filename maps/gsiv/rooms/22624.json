    "A heavy black iron chandelier hangs from the support beams overhead, each of its many arms bearing a tallow candle.  Wirework mannequins lurk in the corners, casting raucous shadows across the walls, and in the center of the room is an ebon wire birdcage housing an obsidian raven.  A pair of matching ebonwood chests sit open beneath the birdcage, and elevated on carved ebonwood pedestals, velvet-lined glass cases display a variety of wares."
