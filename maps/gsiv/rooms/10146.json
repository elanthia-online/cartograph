    "Floods have carried away much of the soil, exposing the twisted roots of trees that cling and sink into the ground like skeletal fingers.  A dense canopy of foliage blocks most of the light, allowing only a few thin rays to creep through the branches and forests of hanging ivy.  There is barely a path to travel, but the swamp has thinned enough to make way through the trees.",
