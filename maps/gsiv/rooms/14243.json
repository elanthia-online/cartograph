    "Overseen by a gold-banistered raised walkway, the eastern portion of the plaza is a sea of gold and white cushions.  The evenly spaced seating allows for a carpeted aisle leading up to an ora-bound honey oak door in the stone wall.  Worked in intricate detail, the illuminated dome above depicts an elderly figure with a flowing white beard, his bearing still powerful despite the weight of years."
