    "Waist-high weeds sprouting along the old road, some interspersed amongst the paving stones, are joined by scrub bushes and the occasional towering tree.  A darkness hovers over the road as it leads to the north and into a thickly-canopied forest.  Barely visible over the weeds is a roughly-hewn granite tablet."
