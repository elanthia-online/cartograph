    "Fit for the Lord of the Manor, the walls of this bath are lined with red cedar planks at their base and topped with clean white plaster.  The centerpiece of the room is an enormous claw-footed tub which stands at the east wall of the room.  Black glaes faucets match the racks which hold thick terry towels, large enough to comfortably wrap two halflings.  The cedar in the air mixes with the scent of herbs drifting through an open window, creating a delightful treat for the senses."
