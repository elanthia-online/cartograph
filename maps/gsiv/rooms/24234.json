    "Stalagmites jut out of the ground, paired with stalactites that splay out from the ceiling.  The water-glazed formations are arranged in arcing rows, lending the appearance of multiple gaping maws spread across the distance between a doorway and a vast, murky lake.  Small pools of clear water reflect the sputtering flames of torches that send shadows scurrying about in their flaring, haphazard light.  Below a gaping hole at the southern edge of the lake, the water gathers into a churning river."
