    "A variety of feathers hang from hemp strings along the walls of the wagon, accounting for a vast array of bird species, while aging parchments pressed beneath glass offer instruction on various fletching methods.  A tightly woven wicker basket sits at the corner of one of the rugs cushioning the floor of the wagon, and a slim metal-framed case sits beneath a wall-length peg board.  Glass-shaded lamps filled with amber oil are lit to shed ample light across the wares."
