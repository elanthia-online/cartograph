    "Silvery moonlight cascades over the garden, gilding everything within the walls.  Beds overflowing with fragrant herbs and flowers line the borders of this small garden.  The high stone walls, constructed of smooth grey-blue granite, are nearly covered with tendrils of creeping fig.  A small wooden bench serves as a place for quiet rest and thought.",
