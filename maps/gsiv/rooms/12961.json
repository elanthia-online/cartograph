    "A black basalt obelisk is imbedded in the hilltop and stands as a shadow against the night sky.  Just to the east, at the very crest of the hill, rises a circular tower of granite blocks.  A narrow path splits off from the circle about the edifice and curves downhill to the north past a small moss-covered knoll.",
