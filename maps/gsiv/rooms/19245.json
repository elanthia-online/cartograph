    "An array of small cabinets huddles under a wooden overhang in this slightly constricted area.  Dark green hedges tower overhead, standing uncomfortably close to the torch-lined walkway that winds throughout.  A mannequin, barely recognizable under all the bandages, splints, and tourniquets, leans against the hedge in one corner, and a few white canvas cots stand side-by-side in another corner.  Someone has neatly trimmed openings in the hedges to the north, west and south."
