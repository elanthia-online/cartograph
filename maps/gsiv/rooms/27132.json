    "Deep purple lavender crowds the borders of the walk, their open blossoms delicately scenting the air with a sweet essence.  Tiny crystal globes hanging from slender ironwork poles dimly light the path as it winds through the flower's tall stalks.  A large boulder rests beside the path, moss framing a painted wooden sign affixed to its worn surface."
