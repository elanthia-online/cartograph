    "The tunnel flares out into a wide slippery mouth yawning at the sea.  A pair of long stalactites hang from above like the fangs of a great snake, and the wind whistles into the cave with a sibilant hiss.  Below the surf claws at the cliff face, slowly rending the rocks with bestial ferocity no less terrifying for the eons it will take to tear away the island's flesh."
