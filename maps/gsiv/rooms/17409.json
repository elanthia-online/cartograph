    "Soft moonlight bathes the courtyard in its silvery light, spotlighting a sculpture of Phoen and Oleani standing in the area's center.  A walkway of round windak disks leads from an archway in the palisade, and divides around the statuary, ending at the brightly lit entrance to a wooden building.  The structure's walls are carved to mimic the living trees of the palisade, the effect more convincing in Lady Night's gentle illumination.",
    "The songs of birds living in the palisade fill the air of the cozy courtyard.  In the center stands a sculpture of Phoen and Oleani.  A walkway of round windak disks leads from an archway in the palisade, and divides around the statuary, ending at the entrance to a wooden building.  The structure's walls are carved to mimic the living trees of the palisade, and are rendered with beautiful detail."
