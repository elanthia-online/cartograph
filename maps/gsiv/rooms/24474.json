    "Adjacent to an open doorway, several gilt-framed paintings hang above a sideboard with an ornate silver tray on it.  Tall bookshelves line the walls with rolling ladders attached to accommodate access to the vast collection of aged volumes.  Centered around a finely carved thanot fireplace on the east wall, a comfortable leather sofa and some leather wingback chairs provide an inviting spot to read or converse."
