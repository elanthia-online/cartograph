  "description": [
    "Large, maroon silk starfish cover most of the gold quilt on the bunk, picking up the matching tones in the maoral paneling.  With its head against the outer bulkhead and a brassbound, maoral seachest against its foot, it's difficult to get to the far side of the bunk.  Maroon glaes-shaded lamps hang in gimballed wallmounts to either side of the bunk's head."
