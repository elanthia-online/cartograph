    "The cabin is not only roomier than any other, but also the most richly appointed by far.  A heavy modwir desk sits opposite a generous -- although short -- bed carved with fanciful sea serpents roiling in turbulent seas.  A damask comforter covers the bed's white linen sheets, and a variety of patterned rugs carpet the deck in tones of crimson and powder blue."
