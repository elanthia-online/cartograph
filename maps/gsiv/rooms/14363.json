    "Twin golden spires climb towards the sky, ornately configurated with tiny crabs, starfish, and seashells.  Black wrought iron fences run parallel, a few feet apart and in from the roof's edge, creating this narrow widow's walk.  To the north, Solhaven Bay and Baron's Quay are clearly visible, as is the mouth of the Vornavis Canal with its fortifications.  Off to the northeast, busy North Market Bridge and the North 'Haven quays teem with life.  Marshtown's distinguishable geography is just beyond.",

Black wrought iron fences run parallel, a few feet apart and in from the roof's edge, creating this narrow widow's walk.  To the north, lights along Solhaven Bay and Baron's Quay are clearly visible.  Off to the northeast, busy North Market Bridge and the North 'Haven quays teem with life.  Moonlight casts its silvery glow over the ocean, twinkling as it dances upon the waves."
