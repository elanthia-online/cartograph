    "The fabric walls of this small stall are only loosely tied to its wooden frame, the vibrantly hued material rustling with even the slightest breeze.  A short, three-legged table sits in the middle of this area, with a small tin bucket atop it, and a tall willow flower basket sits directly beside it."
