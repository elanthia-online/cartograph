    "Shadowed by fiddlehead ferns, a pathway of soft white pebbles follows the gentle curve of a bubbling brook as it slips past clusters of glossy-leafed holly trees.  A quaint bungalow can be glimpsed over the edge of the ferns at one end of the pathway, while a large tanik tree stands at the other side across an arched footbridge.  Cross-hatched beams support platforms that are wrapped in railings and silken banners, which create a colorful dwelling."
