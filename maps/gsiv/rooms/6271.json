    "Thick scented smoke chokes the air, fed from a banked fire of aromatic green branches in the center of the hut.  The walls of the hut are lined with piles of moth-eaten blankets and personal effects, suggesting that quite a few kobolds live here.  The remainder of the hut is crowded with jars of unguents, crooked staves, feathered bags, and every other form of talisman or source of evocative magic imaginable."
