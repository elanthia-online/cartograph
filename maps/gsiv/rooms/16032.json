  "description": [
    "Plain wooden walls rise from an unfinished wooden floor.  Just above a grey-veined white marble fountain hangs a pair of cast iron sconces, and an uneven wooden ceiling completes the picture.  A tall oak and ivory cabinet and a clawfooted cherrywood table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
