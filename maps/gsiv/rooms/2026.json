    "The beach slopes gently down to the sea, its moonlit sand broken here and there with dark splotches created by piles of kelp washed up at high tide.  A stretch pocked by broken shells marks the edge of the more closely packed sand still awash from cascading waves.  The roar of the surf is a constant background melody, its song timeless and languid.",
    "The beach slopes gently down to the sea, its glaring white broken here and there with the deep green and sienna brown tones of piles of kelp washed up at high tide.  A spattering of broken shells marks the edge of the more closely packed sand still awash from cascading waves.  The roar of the surf is a constant background melody, its song timeless and languid."
