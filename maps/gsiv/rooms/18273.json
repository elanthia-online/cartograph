    "The slowly ascending landscape begins to give way to the incline of a magnificent mountain.  Though darkness enhances the ever present ethereal mist inhibiting a clear view, the shrouded image of the massive formation is somewhat discernable to the scrutinizing eye.  The distant glint of fireflies dancing among the shadows in the northern foothills creates pinpoints of faint light, while the surface of the river lazily moving northwest gleams wetly in the light of the moon."
