    "A stark, leafless tree rises to the north.  The dark trunk and branches lean out over a steep cliff, as if seeking final respite after many arduous years of simply trying to survive.  Part of a pitiful bird's nest straddles two branches, the rest having been stripped away by the incessant wind."
