  "description": [
    "The desiccated forms of blackened, twisted weeds dot the ground, their withered leaves drooping into the black ash that partially obscures the cracked, red dirt underneath.  Hardier vegetation grows in random clusters throughout the area, adding a faint tinge of green to the otherwise lifeless surroundings."
