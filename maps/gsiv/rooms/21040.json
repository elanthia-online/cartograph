    "Five giant pillars of smooth grey stone stand in the center of this circular clearing.  Deep white sand covers the entire area, which is free of the trees and vegetation that grow around the perimeter.  Unlike the rest of the jungle, this area is strangely quiet, with only the occasional cry of birds heard in the distance.  A dense canopy of mist lingers around the pillars, obscuring the sky above."
