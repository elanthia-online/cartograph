    "A narrow path of dirty stone bridges a huge magma river that runs the entire length of the room.  Above you, a tunnel of clear glaes holds more lava at bay, surrounding you in blasting heat and angry molten rock.  You can only hope that the glaes is thick enough to keep the lava from leaking through."
