    "The relative quiet of the outer space continues in this room, but is somehow magnified.  The clutter that was evident has also vanished, leaving this area well-ordered and neat.  The walls of the tent are adorned with large swathes of brightly-colored cloth, and a rich mahogany sign hangs in a place of prominence amongst them."
