    "A small trickle of water runs down the mountainside to the south, made green by algae and slime.  A few scraggly flowers and bushes grow next to the flow, but they look sickly and half dead.  Glancing at the heavy clouds, you wonder if the sun ever shines here, and briefly, you wonder if there even is a sun.",

Glancing at the featureless night sky, you wonder if the moons ever shine here, and briefly, you wonder if the moons are even there."
