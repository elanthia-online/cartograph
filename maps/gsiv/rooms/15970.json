    "Trails wind up and down through the drifts of snow mantling the bluff, the routes circling around trees and skirting large boulders.  Cottages sit along the way, their brightly painted shutters adding merry splashes of color to the white, green and grey palette of the mountains.  Wood smoke mingles with the spicy pine perfume in a heady incense."
