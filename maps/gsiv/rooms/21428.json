  "description": [
    "Arching vines dangle from the high limbs of the nearby banyan trees, their lengths laden with yellow moss.  Stretching beyond the simple plank walkway is a dark murky pool, its distant shores lost in haze and mist.  Sitting upon a rhimar chest, a young boy gazes intently into the cloudy depths with his back to a hastily scratched wood sign."
