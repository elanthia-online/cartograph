    "In the back corner of this small alcove, a lumpy cushion of sorts is tucked in beside a miniature oak wine barrel and covered with a sea thrak-embroidered cotton blanket.  From the ceiling, intricate ornaments made of rainbow glaes glisten in the lamp light, casting bright fragments of color across the walls."
