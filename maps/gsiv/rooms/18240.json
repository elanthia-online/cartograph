    "Weathered ironwood planks, which are in very poor shape, make up the deck of the ship.  A trio of tall masts spread out around the deck; however, they remain without sail and are not in any sort of working order.  Ironically, various birds have overrun the crow's nest, and feathers drift over its edges.  A short flight of steps leads down to a rusty-hinged wooden door, while on the opposite side of the deck, a ship's wheel is tied off to the railing."
