  "description": [
    "The vantage point here gives a full view of a glowing orange magma lake in a crater to the east.  The atmosphere is barely tolerable, with heavy gasses and sulfurous fumes impairing vision and breathing.  One misstep is a potentially hazardous plummet into the fiery heart of the crater below."
