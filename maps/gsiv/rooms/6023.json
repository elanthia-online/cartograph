    "A round, brick well stands among the usual clusters of weeds.  Twin cedar beams rise toward the sky to support an equally thick crossbeam.  Mounted on this crossbeam is a crank, and a thick rope coils over the crank's mechanism to dangle a bucket into the well.  Though the weeds insidiously crowd the well and attempt to possess the entire area, someone has cleared a small area around the well and planted some petunias.",
