  "description": [
    "Various benches are set about the room, their expanses covered with repair and polish kits, while curved chairs sport neatly folded woolen blankets in a shade of royal blue.  Standing at opposite ends of the room are two nearly identical doors, differing only in the grain of wood of which each is fashioned.  Set at a safe distance from a downward spiraling staircase is a slender ladder bound to the smooth limestone wall, which leads to an ironbound trapdoor set into the ceiling."
