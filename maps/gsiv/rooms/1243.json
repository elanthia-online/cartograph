    "This cramped, dusty office displays all the standard appointments that mark it as serving an extremely important role in the bureaucracy of the town government.  Dilapidated, make-shift shelves are crammed full of books and papers that bear no evidence of being organized in any useful manner.  Everything is covered with a thick layer of dust, and the walls and ceiling are stained with black from the smoke that rises from the single, small lamp that rests on a high desk in the center of the room."
