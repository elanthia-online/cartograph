    "The high peaked ceiling and walls are made entirely of glaes, magnifying the light that enters this plant-filled room.  Trilliums, aster, and chrysanthemums cluster along a winding path that works its way toward two large eucalyptus trees that support an oversized hammock.  Privacy is maintained with a climbing vine on each wall, with ivy framing the door and a trellis supporting wisteria.  Beneath the trellis rests a small font and various flowers seeking the shade provided."
