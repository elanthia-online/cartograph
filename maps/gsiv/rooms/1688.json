    "The mountainous terrain provides a dramatic background to a derelict homestead.  The farm house, clearly abandoned, is flanked by a pair of dead trees.  To the south the creek has widened to become the narrow Lake Tanai.  Weeds and small saplings grow in the fields which once nourished crops.  Some bright yellow sunflowers grow tall to the east."
