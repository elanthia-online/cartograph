    "Brocaded silk in a deep cobalt hue covers the walls, meeting with a sleek black marble floor veined in grey.  A canopied bed covered in blue and grey silks is flanked on either side by lacquered black willow nighstands, and the entire space is illuminated in patches by a smattering of candelight flickering behind filigree silver sconces."
