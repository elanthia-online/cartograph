    "This particular tunnel appears to be a dead end, at least for anything larger than a rat.  The ceiling drops dramatically until it nearly meets the floor, and the water has pooled at the far end of the room into a nice sized puddle.  One might consider taking a refreshing drink, except for the odd, unearthly glow to the water.  Nope, that can't be healthy."
