    "Further progress up the mountain to the north is blocked by a sprawling rockfall.  Given the steepness of this peak and the apparent instability of the rock pile, attempting to climb it would be unwise.  The mountain goats around here do not seem to be constrained by wisdom, however, if the scatterings of spoor are anything to go by."
