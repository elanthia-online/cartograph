    "Shelves of books line three of the walls of this tranquil room.  The fourth wall is covered by a large, faded tapestry.  In the center of the room is a tall, pigeonholed scroll rack.  Comfortable chairs are scattered haphazardly throughout.  Large candles of fine beeswax scented with winterberry provide a soft, even light.  In an alcove by the door the guild librarian slouches in a chair, apparently asleep."
