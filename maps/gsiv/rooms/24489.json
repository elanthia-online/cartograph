    "Tastefully decorated in shades of pure white, silver and gold, this room can easily be dressed up for special occasions.  Along one wall hang painted portraits of the many wedding couples, solstice festivals, and society dances.  A small stage in the corner provides a performance area for bards, and the entire area is lit by elaborate chandeliers."
