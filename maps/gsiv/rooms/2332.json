    "On the edge of the glacier, you have a marvelous view of the city to the south.  Your eyes follow the slightly haphazard streets around Icemule Trace until they meet the four roads and eventually the gates in the walls.  Above you towers the great temple, carved from the purest ice and shining with a nearly divine light in the sun.  A ramp of ice leads down to the west, while an ice staircase leads down to the east and a set of carved ice steps lead down to the northwest around an oddly shaped ice flow.",
