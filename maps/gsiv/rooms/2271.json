    "An old mining cart leans precariously against the western wall, three of its wooden wheels long-since rotted away.  Though the floors show signs of wear and a few deep ruts, only spiders occupy themselves here now.  The vein of precious glaes is not quite so obvious here, though closer inspection of the area around the eastern path provides a glimpse of the riches that might be found in this area."
