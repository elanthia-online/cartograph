    "A neatly-kept house sits enveloped in several feet of ice.  The back half, as well as much of the left side, has collapsed, crushed by the ice.  The rest looks much like it must have before, the paint bright and lovingly done.  A small garden has been plotted in the front yard, carrot stalks flattened against the ground and heads of lettuce splattered across the dirt."
