    "Laden with grooming tools, the small subsection of the tent is crafted of brown canvas walls and carpeted with thick woolen rugs.  Curry combs, shedding blades, sweat scrapers, clippers, and scissors dangle from metal hooks arranged upon storage racks, while baskets beneath are filled with bot knives, brushes, and sponges.  A small wooden table and chair occupy the center of the space."
