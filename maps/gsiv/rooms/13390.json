    "A slight hill rises to the northeast, a large black willow growing atop its rolling peak.  Sprays of near-black violets grow within the miniature canyons between the ancient tree's roots, matching the quietly somber tone of the willow's ebon bark.  The cobblestoned path branches off to the northeast, offering a pleasant view of the verdant green grounds."
