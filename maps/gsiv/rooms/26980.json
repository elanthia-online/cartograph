    "Yellowish green moss and granite flagstones converge upon the center of the garden where an enormous pool is recessed into the ground, its depths divided into equal quadrants that glow brightly.  Four painted boulders are arranged at various places around the body of water, their painted faces turned towards the statue that sits in its center.  Stone benches and a smattering of wrought iron tables line the edge of the area offering respite for visitors."
