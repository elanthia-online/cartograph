    "Painted in various shades of green, the walls are patterned with an elaborate leaf design and set at intervals with oil lamps covered by avian-styled shades.  A collection of rare hides and pelts are scattered about, and tapestries woven to depict various herbs and plants are draped from the ceiling.  A massive white bear skin occupies the heart of the room, its fur pristine and plush."
