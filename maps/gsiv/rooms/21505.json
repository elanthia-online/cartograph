    "Panels of deep purple and bronze-threaded sapphire silk line the walls, a complement to the plush carpet woven to resemble peacock feathers that spreads across the floor.  An ornamental dress form sits in one corner, resting near a polished curving armoire.  A small compartmented counter holds various pairs of shoes, resting beneath a silver rack designed to look like spreading branches."
