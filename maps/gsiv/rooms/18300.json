    "Moonlight dances across the large waves that crest, roll, and race up the beach, only to quickly retreat as the ocean's fury is spent upon the sands.  Ever changing beneath the powerful waves, the beach obscures and reveals a collection of stones, wood, and shells.  Faint floral scents perfume the air, the delicate odor competing with the strong tang of the sea."
