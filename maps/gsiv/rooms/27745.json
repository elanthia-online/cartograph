    "The glacial floe above this section of wall has been painstakingly carved over time into a sculpture of notable beauty.  Successive thaws and freezing has covered and recovered the bas-relief carving, giving the piece a multi-dimensional quality.  From the depths comes a horde of trolls, charging over a wide open field toward a small village.  An armed band of halflings stands in martial array ready to protect kith and kin from the invaders."
