    "At either side of this intersection, two mansions compete for the eye's attention.  To the west, a slate-grey granite manor sits in an immaculately manicured lawn.  Its tall columns support a two-story portico that shelters tall windows framed with silvery curtains.  The mansion to the east is built on a grander plan, with high greystone walls supported by flying buttresses and magnificent stained glass windows.  Through meticulous care, a lush flower garden appears perfectly wild.",

The second, a white marble villa, is built on a grander plan, with high walls supporting a sapphire-tiled dome and magnificent stained glass windows.
