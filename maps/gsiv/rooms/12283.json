    "Sunlight pours into the room from the giant windows on either side of the doorway, catching the particles of flour in the air and creating a haze inside the bakeshop.  The baker diligently kneads some dough, singing a merry tune in his deep, baritone voice as he goes.  Confections of all sorts, some still warm from baking, line the glass bakery counter along one wall.",
    "Moonlight pours into the room from the giant windows on either side of the doorway, catching the particles of flour in the air and creating a haze inside the bakeshop. The baker slowly kneads some fresh dough, obviously nearing the end of his energy as he works, eyes half-closed.  Confections of all sorts, some still warm from baking, line the glass bakery counter along one wall."
