    "The carefully tended garden is ensconced in a small hollow near the cliff's edge.  Through small crevices and in the low bowl of the hollow itself, a myriad of flowering plants tumble over one another in their haste to garner sunlight and water.  A small trail leads to the edge of the precipice.",

Through small crevices and in the low bowl of the hollow itself, a myriad of flowering plants tumble over one another in their haste to garner sunlight and water.  A small trail, barely visible in the moonlight, leads to the edge of the precipice."
