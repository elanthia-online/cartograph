    "Huge and imposing, a giant skull stands sentinal over this area on a section of cleared ground.  A curved ramp made out of various bones has been settled in front of it, one end pointing directly at the skull's gaping mouth.  A gangly four-armed man keeps watch from one side with a wooden bucket of knucklebone balls at his feet."
