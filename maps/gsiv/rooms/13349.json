    "[Huge Tower, Nexus]"

  "description": [
    "Wooden planks reinforced with bands of steel form a circular platform high into the sky.  A tall ladder is bolted to the side of the tower, leading down toward the ground far below.  An arched roof overhead provides shelter from the elements, and the tower branches off into four main sections from this point.  The surrounding landscape is visible for miles, the horizon blurring into a blend of land and sky."
