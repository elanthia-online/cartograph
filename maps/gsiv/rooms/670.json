    "Rolled hay lies in the fields on either side of the road, waiting for a farmer to come haul the hay back to the barn.  The rich fields stretch for miles on end, indicating that the community of Sylvarraend might account for a very large portion of the base foodstuffs for both Ta'Illistim and Ta'Vaalor alike."
