    "Pale mistwood walls are polished to a fine sheen, bringing out the deeper grey of the burls and knots of the wood.  White-painted oak frames the front double windows and the door, each inset with diamond-paned clear glaes, letting in beams of brilliant sunlight.  A passageway to the north side of the shop leads out to a garden portico.",

White-painted oak frames the front double windows and the door, each inset with diamond-paned clear glaes, letting in beams of soft moonlight.  Oil lamp torches light a passageway to the north side of the shop, leading out to a garden portico."
