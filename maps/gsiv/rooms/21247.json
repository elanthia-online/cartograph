    "A niello-framed moonlit willow painting hangs on one of the painted white plaster walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  An elegantly dressed maiden statue sits in one corner of an ash grey granite floor.  There is a carved stone cabinet on one side of the shop and a silk-covered dress mannequin on the other."
