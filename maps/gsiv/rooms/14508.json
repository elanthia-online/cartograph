    "A raised fence overlooks a woodland plain enclosure serving as the home to numerous types of foxes.  The foxes keep a safe distance away from others not of their kind, which is not a problem in the sprawling expanse.  Gentle breezes ruffle the grass and foliage, stirring the furred inhabitants."
