    "The irregular shadows of night darkened ruins spread out to the east of the pyramid.  Wide stone steps lead down to the streets below.  Another set of steps lead up to the second level of the pyramid.",
    "Positioned above all the single story buildings of the city, it is possible to see the damage that time has wrought.  Toppled pillars and tumbled stones spread across an extensive open area to the east.  Wide stone steps lead down to the streets below.  Another set of steps lead up to the second level of the pyramid."
