  "description": [
    "Off in this cozy corner booth you are treated to a bit more privacy by high wooden partitions, but afforded a good view of the bustling saloon hall. The small oil lamp on the table provides a warm and steady glow of light. The noises of the crowds out there seem far away from this perfect little spot for a quiet dinner, while you watch the patrons and the innkeep go about their evening's business."
