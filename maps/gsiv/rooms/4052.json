    "Yards of spidersilk suspended overhead form a canopy trimmed with fragrant garlands of white roses and Imaera's lace.",
    "Garlands of vibrant roses are strung along the linden-latticed ceiling of the room, the fragrant blooms matching the others spilling over in glass vases spread against the ivory-painted walls.  A soft wool rug, dyed pale blue, leads toward a blush-stained linden armoire set at an angle towards a stained glass partition situated towards the back of the area."
