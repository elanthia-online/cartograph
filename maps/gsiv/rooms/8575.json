    "A deceptively tranquil and seductive meadow spreads out before your eyes.  You are overwhelmed for a moment by the sweet smell of the wildflowers and the constant hypnotic humming of insects.  A sink hole in a depression gushes forth with a trickling spring to one side, while along the other side of the opening, a small, mud path is evident."
