    "A variety of candles are placed upon an ancient reading desk, its surface marred with ink, stubs of wax, and ageless dust.  Placed upon the desk is a scarred leather journal, its pages cracked and yellowed by the passage of time.  Deep crimson rugs cover the floor, and a solemn silence fills the small chamber."
