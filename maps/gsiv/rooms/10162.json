  "description": [
    "Sharply-inclined sides of dark loamy earth carpeted with creeping vines and thorny bushes skirt the narrow path along the floor of the ravine.  A residual trickle of what was once a raging streambed slips lazily around element-worn rocks.  Silver beeches and tall oaks, younger than the old growth of the forest that meets the ravine, provide some cover overhead."
