    "Silvery rolaren sconces are set at regular intervals along the walls, fine banners representing each Dhe'nar caste hanging between them.  Dominating the east wall is a richly-embroidered silk tapestry depicting three Dhe'nar nobles in a stylized battlefield.  Set into the stone next to the tapestry is a small mithril plaque."
