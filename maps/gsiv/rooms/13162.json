    "Scouts with reports constantly run in and out of the office, dropping off report scrolls into a wide bin on a massive granite desk.  Maps of the Dragonspine and Elanthia as a whole have been mounted up on the walls, riddled with colorful tacks pinpointing current locations of enemy activity.  A covered halberd rests in the corner of the room, beside a hammered rolaren tower shield."
