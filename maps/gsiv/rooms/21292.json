    "A potted white rosebush set in one of the front corners provides a soft floral scent that greets you as you enter.  A domed sea glass ceiling curves gracefully over the oak-paneled walls adorned with bright tapestries, and a plush white carpet covering a pale grey marble floor leads to an ornately carved armoire at the back of the room."
