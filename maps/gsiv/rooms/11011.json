    "A strong wind whips around the side of the bluff, attempting to dislodge anything foolish enough to venture up to this precipice.  The way ends here as the trail ahead has apparently lost its battle to stay attached to the bluff.  A sheer drop to the bay hundreds of feet below cuts off further advance, and the sheer cliff face makes upward travel possible only if one has wings.  The only safe exit is back down the trail."
