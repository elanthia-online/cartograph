  "description": [
    "Cobblestones have been piled high, forming a crude but sturdy barrier that blocks the road.  Several gaps have been made in the wall, large enough for anyone on foot to pass through, but too small for even the smallest of wagons.  A large sign, once colorful but now faded, points west to where scraps of faded cloth can be faintly seen fluttering."
