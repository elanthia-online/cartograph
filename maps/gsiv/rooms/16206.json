  "description": [
    "This spacious garden offers a quiet refuge.  Cobblestone paths wind among beds of rare flowers, ornamental plants, and healing herbs.  The ceiling high overhead is one huge pane of frosted quartz, allowing the sunlight to shine in liberally while trapping the heat.  Two stone benches sit across from each other down the main pathway.  Ancient arched trees provide a shady spot for contemplation."
