    "Crystalline tears of golden sap hang like icicles from scars in the trees along the old path.  Torn from the living wood, shards of bark litter the forest floor.  Numerous branches, crippled by some frenzied force, dangle like broken limbs.  The undergrowth has been upturned, as if a battle of some size were waged here.  A single yellowed cobblestone, still visible amidst the tumult of uprooted shrubs and bits of bark, indicates the direction of the ancient road.",
