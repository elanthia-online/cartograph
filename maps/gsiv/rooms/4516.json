    "Narrow bands of wood, each affixed to the wall with a number of stout little wooden pegs, cover the stone walls save the path leading back east.  Small patches of cured furs serve as a floor covering.  On a raised dais, a wooden stand holds several long handled weapons and has numerous quarterstaves leaning against it."
