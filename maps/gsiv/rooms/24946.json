    "Nestled between shops that line the corner, a tall tower looks out over the village square.  A constant clicking emanates from behind a clockwork face at the top of the tower, although the hands appear to be stuck at three o'clock.  At its base, a small courier's post stands empty, a pile of undelivered messages in a metal bin near the door."
