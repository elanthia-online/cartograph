    "A sturdy plank bridge spans the river chasm, offering a westward crossing and a respite from following the chasm deeper into the Dead Plateau's interior.  In the other direction, the trail follows the chasm's edge to the east and the plateau's edge again.  It is fortunate that the crevice narrows to approximately thirty feet at this point, allowing construction of the bridge, for farther up the crevice the sides diverge widely again as far as the eye can see."
