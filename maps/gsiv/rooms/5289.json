    "The path is flanked on either side by the thick trunks of trees so dense that a virtual wall is formed.  The walls of trees are unnaturally straight, as if guiding travelers due east and west.  The fog rises higher from the ground behind the trees, making swirling shapes which dance ominously behind the wooden curtain."
