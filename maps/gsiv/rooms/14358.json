    "Pristine and tidy, the small room has walls of stucco that are a brilliant shade of white.  A large marble fireplace, riddled with gold veins, rises in the northern corner of the room and casts rippling orange lights upon a pair of armchairs that have been positioned close by.  Near the door is a curtained arch with a low counter topped in black marble set before it."
