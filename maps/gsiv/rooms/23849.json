    "A banyan tree towers over this area and several platforms can be seen up in the wide branches above.  Liana vines hang down so that they create a flowering curtain directly in the path.  A thin trail between the two closest trees leads into the clearing in the center of the ring.  The scent of flowers is heavy in the mist-laden air, and it mingles with the faint ocean fragrance brought in on gentle breezes."
