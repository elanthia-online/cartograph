  "description": [
    "Under the watchful eye of one of the store's assistants, hardworking dwarves continually haul carts filled with furniture in and out of a large invar-braced archway.  A bright orange banner announces, \"Cort's Emporium,\" and is suspended by wires fastened to three limestone stalactites.  The massive cavern echoes with the murmurs of business, though the noise is partially muffled by two man-made stone walls that partition the emporium into three distinct areas."
