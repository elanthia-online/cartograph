    "Built around the entire trunk of the tree, this platform is massive in size.  A wooden railing carved with an intricate knotwork design surrounds the entire platform.  A vibrant bluebird flies by, landing in a nest filled with babies begging for food.  Up above, the cloud-filled sky is finally starting to become visible."
