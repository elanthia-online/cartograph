    "Sheltered by a slanted roof, the back porch of the manor is enclosed by a white railing.  Wicker baskets of tropical plants are suspended from the beams above.  Comfortable enough for two, wooden porch swing hangs to the side, colorful pillows covering the seat.  A flagstone path leads away from the building, meandering through beds of bright flowers contrasting with the rich verdant grass and the seascape beyond.  A pair of carved oak doors leads back inside, flanked on both sides by potted ferns."
