  "description": [
    "Moisture infuses the air, adding a glistening aspect to the plant-life.  Even the ground becomes over-saturated, creating swampy conditions that contrast with the rest of the rainforest.  Thin bands of moonlight caress the shadowy ground as if pointing out where the jungle terrain begins to change.  Further east, the muck becomes more pronounced and unpleasant."
