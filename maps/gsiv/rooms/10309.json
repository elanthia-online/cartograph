  "description": [
    "Carved into the walnut door on the east wall is a detailed rendering of a seashore scene, painstakingly cut to include the smallest details.  Two brass torch holders flank the door, and the torches they contain are totally fresh, with no sign of burning at all.  The courtyard and its huge fountain are plainly visible from this point, as the walkways of the upper floor form the perimeter of a diamond, with the room doors at the four points and the walkways as the sides.",
