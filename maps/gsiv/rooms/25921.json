    "Enclosed by elegant velvet drapery, the ornately framed entrance to the auditorium stands opposite the door leading to the main grounds.  Brass wall sconces hold deep red candles whose brilliance is reflected off the gilded cornice at the ceiling.  Completing the splendor of the foyer, a large bay window provides a stunning view of Lake Sasalis through an opening in the trees."
