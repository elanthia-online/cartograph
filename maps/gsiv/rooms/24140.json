    "Beveled sections of the elongated wagon's walls are covered in dark bronze-scaled paneling, boldly outlining a small carved oak cage that sits below a series of rusted steel hooks.  In the center of the room, tall aromatic grasses and violet-tinged pitcher plants wreathe around a large open-mouth pit hollowed in the ebonwood flooring.  Permeated by a faintly metallic copper tang, a rich herbaceous undertone punctuates the stilness of the air."
