    "Cracked stone flooring thrusts up sharply at odd angles, as though a massive upheaval wracked this structure.  Moss and lichen thrive along the edges of the jutting pieces, drinking from the damp surroundings.  Smooth, ridged tracks cut into the clay exposed underneath the broken stone, the result of collected moisture running off in rivulets."
