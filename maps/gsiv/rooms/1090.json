    "The sound of rushing water, its source possibly to the west, filters in over the moaning of the wind.  The plateau's edge moves off to the west and east, while below, in the distance, moonlight glints off the surface of a river that winds toward the southeast.  The river appears strangely out of place in such a barren land.",
