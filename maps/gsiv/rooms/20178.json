  "description": [
    "The heavy scent from a cluster of swamp magnolias is reminiscent of vanilla and spice.  Tiny dried berry clusters litter the ground beneath the smooth, grey, multi-lobed trunks.  Fallen, creamy white flowers, now brown and shriveled at the edges, lay among a bed of dried, scattered petals."
