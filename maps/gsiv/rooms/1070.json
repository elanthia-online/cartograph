    "A thick rope ladder dangles down the side of the cliff, pooling a bit on the ground.  The top of the ladder is not distinguishable as it disappears quickly into the mists above.  A small barren spot has been worn in the matted grass just below the rope ladder, most likely from the passing of feet and the swaying of the ladder.  In all directions away from the cliff the damp, thick grass grows high enough to prevent movement, although it seems to be somewhat beaten down along the cliff to the northwest."
