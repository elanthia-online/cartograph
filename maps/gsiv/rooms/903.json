  "description": [
    "A low, tentative howling permeates the tunnel, its apparent source a narrow, gash-like fissure in the tunnel ceiling.  Accompanied by chill blasts of mountain air, the howling changes tone from a deep growl to a high shriek according to the force of the wind passing through the opening.  Fed by the fresh, icy air of the surface, the fissure provides ventilation to the underground passages."
