    "Spartan but livable, this small office appears to double as a sleeping room.  A wide steel desk dominates the center of the room, and behind the desk a comfortable padded chair resides.  In the far corner, a metal cot has been pushed up against the wall, and the coverings on the cot are in disarray, as if someone has slept there recently.  Framed portraits of several dwarves occupy the back wall, but the other walls are barren.  A grey steel door provides exit."
