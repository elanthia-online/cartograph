    "[Bard Guild, Bass Clef Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "The Bass Clef table is large, echoing the octagonal shape of its sister table across the room.  It was carved of dark-toned teak wood and boasts a beautiful grain.  Around the deep edge is a pattern of carved lyres and tambour drums, their repeating motif accented with holly and ivy leaves.  A small lantern sitting at the table's center sheds a golden glow across the polished wood."
