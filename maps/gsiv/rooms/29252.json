  "description": [
    "Three model airships sit prominently on display in the middle of the room, each placed within a glass case.  Matching glass-fronted cabinets, fitted with copper, sit apart from the small vessels, their contents filled with larger pieces of airship parts, pieces and paraphernalia.  The floor underneath the exhibit is inset with a square tile, the patina of which matches the greenish finish of a verdigris arch."
