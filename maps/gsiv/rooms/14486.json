    "A long stone ramp leads down into a glass-domed enclosure, the stacked slate walls rising to support the clear, curving roof.  Bird tracks of various sizes and shapes are inlaid into the floor, wandering along a path that leads deeper into the structure.  A squat, tilted bronze-faced sign is placed near a set of wide double doors that lead out."
