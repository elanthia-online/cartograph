    "Little remains of a white marble wall that once stood here.  A spiderweb of cracks runs through the remaining marble, while lizards have made a home where a large chunk of the stone is missing.  Nearby, a marble fountain stands untouched by ruin.  Only stagnant water and leaves fill the fountain's bowls now.",

Nearby, a marble fountain stands untouched by ruin, its white form clearly visible in the darkness.  Only stagnant water and leaves fill the fountain's bowls now."
