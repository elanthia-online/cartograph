  "description": [
    "The avenue passes through an open area where the ceiling reaches high overhead.  Rubblestone Pool borders the walk on the east, and beside it, a bank of lush ferns crowd into a spotlight created by a single ray of sunlight shining down from a crevice above.  Small groups of dwarves stroll around the Pool, talking quietly in a heavy dialect that sounds like all consonants and no vowels."
