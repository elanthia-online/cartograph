    "The var comes to an end at a tiny greystone cottage.  Through the large bay window, you can see an ancient elven woman dozing in an easy chair.  A warming fire, burned down to glowing embers, bathes the room in a cozy orange glow.",
    "The var comes to an end at a tiny greystone cottage.  An ancient elven woman, wizened and wrinkled by untold years, sits at a small table in her grassy yard.  The table is covered with piece of thin black silk embroidered with indecipherable symbols in gleaming gold thread.  A large crystal ball sits atop the silk, refracting the sunlight into a rainbow of colors.  The old woman hums a quiet tune as she gazes deep within the orb.",
    "The var truncates at a small marble house, little bigger than a farmer's cottage.  Its front is almost entirely taken up by windows, each one paned in alternating clear and sapphire blue glass diamonds.  An arched door, placed between them and set with a silver peacock-feather knocker, is flanked by two planters of white roses."
