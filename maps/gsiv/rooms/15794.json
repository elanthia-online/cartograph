    "The guards at the top of an imflass-chain ladder stamp their feet in a vain attempt to fight off the biting cold.  A single torch set in an unadorned iron sconce provides only scarce light, causing shadows to flitter about the area.  Near the torch, a thick imflass door has been fixed securely into the ice and bears a prominent mithril plaque.  To the west, a suspended rope bridge crosses a narrow chasm."
