    "Dotted with freshly cut tree stumps, the path from the southwest spreads out to a rut-lined, muddy road running past newly constructed viewing stands.  Spectators mill about, animatedly chatting about their favorite teams.  Atop the stands, blue and gold pennants whip and snap as a breeze blows through, the rush of warm air from the northeast bringing the scent of hot metal."
