  "description": [
    "A riot of color greets those who reach this secluded meadow.  Reaching heights of one to two meters, cheery stalks of larkspur decorate the fertile ground.  Blossoms of blue and pink grow in abundance, with a smattering of purple and white lending variety to the scene.  Peeking through the blossoms is a verdant backdrop of foliage, with broad leaves divided into deep lobes."
