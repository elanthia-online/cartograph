    "A tattered merchant permit hangs on one of the polished oak walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of an enameled hardwood floor.  There is an oval-shaped speckled marble counter on one side of the shop and a vine-carved mahogany table on the other."
