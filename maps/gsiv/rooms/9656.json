    "The glow from a cheery fire crackling in the fireplace competes with the sunlight streaming through the windows to bathe this large, one-room dwelling with light and warmth.  One large bed and two smaller beds nestle into the corners, and a wooden table with four chairs occupies the center of the room.  Several furs cover the polished hardwood floor.  The house is in immaculate order, although the occupants are nowhere to be seen.",

Knitted curtains, drawn for the night, cover the windows and help keep out the cold.

The house is in immaculate order, although the occupants are nowhere to be seen."
