  "description": [
    "The grey stone of the gatehouse is a sharp contrast to the deep green pine of the surrounding trees.  Narrow lancet windows are set on either side of the gatehouse doorway.  Strands of ivy vines are beginning to take hold on the stones, smoothing the rough edges with the natural softness of their leaves."
