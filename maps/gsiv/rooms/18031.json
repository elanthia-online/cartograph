  "description": [
    "Heated fog rolls in on the breeze from the southwest, blown apart quickly as it follows the contours of the ground.  The source of the strange mist is a carefully crafted mithril fountain in the middle of the Behlayr Square.  Moonlight glints cheerily off the curved edges of the exquisite geothermal wonder, further making a harsh environment seem less hostile."
