    "A domed ceiling rests upon the high block walls of this room.  A slotted opening cut into the ceiling has cracked along its edges and no longer retains its original shape and size.  Large chunks of the marble forming the dome have dropped from the heights to shatter on the hard stone floor below.  A series of steps circling the perimeter of the room descend to the main level of the tower."
