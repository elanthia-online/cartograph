  "description": [
    "The trail flattens out into a platform that runs east-to-west along the crater's rim.  To the southeast is a steep path that leads down to another east-to-west section of the trail.  Far to the south, the shimmering ocean reflects the sunlight shining from above, while to the north, orange clouds rise from the inhospitable cauldron of magma at the center of the crater."
