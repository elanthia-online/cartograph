  "description": [
    "Fashioned to look like a cozy north-country hut, the room's windows have been sand-blasted in a pattern that simulates frost.  The log walls are chinked with Pinefar tundra grass and polar bear skins cover the floor.  A plush pile of the bear pelts occupy a corner, and serve as a warm bed.  Any psychological chill is dispelled by a cheery brass stove with glaes-paned windows."
