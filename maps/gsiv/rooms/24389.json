    "A tangle of massive roots winds its way along the ground here, providing a shady haven speckled with spots of refreshing sun.  The area is a veritable garden -- flowers of every hue and type grow from the moss-laden ground, their florid hues set upon a backdrop of drab grey-greens of the large tree.  The girth of the tree provides a natural fence for the plants, their forms curving around the vivid petals in a gentle embrace."
