    "Gently swirling through the water, the current here is subtle, the river spreading its fingers out into a relatively calm pool before picking up speed at the far end, where it seemingly disappears into a black void.  Suffusing shifting areas of the otherwise inky black water, a glowing grate and the dim, undulating luminesence of tiny black, sinuous shapes swarming around in the water illuminates your immediate vicinity.  A small ledge juts out from slick walls rising up in every direction."
