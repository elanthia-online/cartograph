    "The inner portcullis opens up on a large courtyard surfaced with red octagonal paving stones.  Few signs of ill repair and neglect are openly visible with the exception of the random tuft of brown weeds creeping up through crevices in the stones and scattered, unrecognizable sun-bleached bones.  Overlooking the courtyard is the parapet of the outer wall, accessible by a series of stone steps to the east."
