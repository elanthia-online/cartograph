    "Nothing grows at all in this desolate expanse of ash, and even the twisted trees that hid the wasteland from view seem healthy by comparison.  The powder-fine grey ash swirls and eddies around you, though not even a faint breeze stirs the stillness of the nighttime close air.  Although the area looks scorched, there is none of the sharp charred scent that normally accompanies a forest fire."
