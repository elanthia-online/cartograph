    "Incarnadine sigils wrap around the circular chamber in a tight embrace, their luminescent surfaces casting a bloody light throughout the surroundings as they hum and pulse with power.  A triple-band of the angular sigils forms a tight circle in the middle of the floor, the designs there casting a steady pale violet glow as the rest of the room is intermittently cast in darkness by the wavering symbols around you."
