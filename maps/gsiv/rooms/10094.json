    "The surrounding trees and dense cover of bushes begin to thin out here, revealing a lush, thriving carpet of green grass.  The small stream, revealed in full now, gurgles and bubbles melodically amid the pristine atmosphere.  Curls of thin mist filter in from the north, and the shadow of a large hill looms in the distance."
