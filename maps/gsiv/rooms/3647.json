    "Moonlight pours down, dappling the field of wheat and wildflowers in a soft silver hue.  Barely perceptible in the night is a rock wall lining the outside of the vineyard.  Hundreds of fireflies dance and weave across the field and stone in a dizzying display.  At the end of the cobblestone path a small wooden gate carved with a grape cluster leads into the vineyard.",
    "A three-foot high rock wall lines the outskirts of the vineyard as far as the eye can see.  Surrounding the wall on either side is a myriad of brilliantly-hued wildflowers of all species, blanketed upon a field of wheat.  At the end of the cobblestone path a small wooden gate carved with a grape cluster leads into the vineyard."
