    "Thanks in part to the evenly spaced torches rigged in iron bars buried deep along the berm, the signs of recent digging that interrupt the smooth black sand of the beach, can be avoided.  Broken pieces of shovels are discarded off to the sides, and every once in a while, a loud shout of excitement pierces the peaceful calm induced by the waves repeatedly lapping at the shore.",
    "Signs of recent digging interrupt the smooth black sand of the beach, broken pieces of shovels discarded off to the side of a nearby berm.  Every once in a while, a loud shout of excitement pierces the peaceful calm induced by the waves repeatedly lapping at the shore, and the plaintive cries of sea birds wheeling overhead."
