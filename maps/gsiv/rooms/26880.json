    "[A Mist Opportunity]"

  "description": [
    "Dark mist covers the ground, completely obscuring the floorboards that are evident only by a faint creaking noise produced with each footstep.  Painted in deep crimson, a sturdy weapon rack sits off to the side, and a luminescent crystal orb, filled with a swirling black mass, has been affixed to the top of a black marble stand.  Additional weaponry has been carefully hung from mithril wall hooks."
