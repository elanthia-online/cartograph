    "The floor of the expansive chamber is crafted of dark, mahogany planks.  In the corner, a rectangular glass terrarium occupies an oak table, surrounded by several potted plants.  The interior of the container is cleverly lit, throwing an irregular pattern of reflected light across the rich tone of the floor.  Against the far wall rests a large, feather bed, and the ceiling and walls have been skillfully painted with a mural depicting crisscrossed modwir branches covering a starry night sky."
