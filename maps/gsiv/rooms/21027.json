    "Converging here in massive clumps above ground level, the tangled root systems of clustered trees result in hazardous footing.  Overhead, the leaf canopy filters out the faint light of the stars, making the sky darker than night itself and further complicating any visual detection of obstacles.  Masses of outwardly projecting rosewoods dangerously camouflage the edge of a sheer drop to the southeast, where the escarpment plummets vertically downward for an astounding distance."
