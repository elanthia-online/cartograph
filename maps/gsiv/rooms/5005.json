    "A thick canopy of leafy branches conceals most of the sky, making this low-lying thicket even darker than the rest of the night.  Thick bushes fill the gaps between the massive trunks of the trees, and earthworms and beetles crawl in and out of the deep, soft carpet of decaying leaves on the ground.",
