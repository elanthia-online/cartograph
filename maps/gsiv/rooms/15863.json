    "Beneath a vaulted crimson-hued glass ceiling, an ancient alchemy chart framed in a wyvern-etched obsidian frame hangs on one of the polished black obsidian walls.  An oval-shaped speckled marble counter and an elegantly carved black marble armoire sit in opposite corners while a shadowy black marble tower statue with carved wyverns guarding the archway rests on a flawless obsidian floor."
