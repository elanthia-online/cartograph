    "Nestled between an ebonwood door and a glaes-paned steel door, a natural recess in the stone has been transformed into an open air patio crowded with tables beneath hanging lanterns.  To one side of the passage, a small cart with a broken wheel has been abandoned.  As the ground begins to slant upwards, the cobblestones become increasingly uneven."
