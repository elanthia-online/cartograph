    "Brightly lit from above by a large iron chandelier, this room's walls are lined with shelf after shelf of rolled up scrolls.  Several tables are scattered about the room, each covered with parchment maps and notes.  One of the tables is backed against the wall and has several sets of map-making equipment on it.  The wood plank floor is covered with crumpled balls of paper and ruined maps."
