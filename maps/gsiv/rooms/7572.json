  "description": [
    "The passage widens here, and the dirt floor is scattered with the remains of a vicious battle.  Skeletons of gnomes, some still hung with scraps of tattered leather, lie among the dried and broken jaws and limbs of giant ants.  Glowing lichen from the walls has crept over many of the corpses, its greenish light illuminating the eerie tableau."
