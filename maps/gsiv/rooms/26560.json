    "The dusky illumination from soot-shaded lanterns and the pitted countenance of the walls create an elaborate play of shadow and light along the length of the brief hallway.  Water stains darken the floor and stretch toward the ceiling like dark, tendriled digits vainly searching for the light.  Brittle lengths of driftwood tangled in a mass of rigging line are mounted artfully on the wall, while underfoot, a threadbare carpeted runner leads the way."
