  "description": [
    "The low ridge overlooks a shimmering pool of crystalline water in the near distance.  No mere mirage is the pool: its freshness is a tantalizing perfume in the air, one accompanied by the dusky aroma of thriving sage and the sparkle of enthusiastic birdsong.  The life-giving pond waits down a long ramp of hard-packed sand worn away by the passage of many feet."
