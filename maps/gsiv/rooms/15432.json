    "Blue watered silk walls rise from a glossy mahogany floor.  Just above a fishscale blue mermaid figurine hangs a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry, and a mosaic tiled ceiling completes the picture.  A flexible willow woven basket and a vine-carved mahogany table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
