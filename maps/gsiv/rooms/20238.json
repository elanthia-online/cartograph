    "Fungal tubes rise out of the leaf-covered ground, their twisted stems curving away from the rotting nutrients of the swamp's muddy banks.  Bright green mold-covered tree limbs lie in a protective ring about the russet brown protrusions and display signs of hooves, beak, and claw marks across their warped lengths.  Sprouts of bright green swamp privet break through the dismal grey and brown of the landscape, their spindled limbs mildly spotted with layered and waxy, lime green blubs."
