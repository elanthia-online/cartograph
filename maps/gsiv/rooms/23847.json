  "description": [
    "Dark bark encapsulates the trunk of the rosewood tree around which various platforms and ramps have been affixed to thicker branches.  Hanging liana vines add a touch of color to the otherwise green and brown landscape.  A strong, sweet smell lingers in the air here, a mixture of the liana blooms as well as the rosewood tree itself.  Mingled with the vines, a woven rope disappears below the platform, heading toward the ground far below."
