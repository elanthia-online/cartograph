    "A large maoral desk, polished to a deep red sheen, rests across one corner of the room.  Precisely placed quills and a careful arrangement of dry ink pots give the desk an unused air.  By contrast, a library table in the center of the room is strewn with piles of contracts and lists of figures.  Thick wool carpets and velvet-draped windows muffle the sounds of passersby on the street outside."
