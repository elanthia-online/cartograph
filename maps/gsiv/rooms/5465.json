    "A thread of smoke rises from the stone chimney of a farmstead on the road's north side, and the scent of a wood fire hangs in the air, masking the other odors common to a holding where chickens nest about the yard and hogs sleep beneath the nearby fruit trees.  Alone of four holdings along this stretch of the road, this thatch roofed house shows signs of habitation.",
