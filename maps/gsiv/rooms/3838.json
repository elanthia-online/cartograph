  "description": [
    "Wide and sheltered, the ledge offers a respite from the cold wind howling outside.  Worn smooth from years of providing shelter, the ledge also offers a few comfortable boulders to lean against.  The ledge reaches back about fifteen feet before running abruptly into a cracked and fissured stone wall."
