    "The mast is broken and splintered, having been shattered by some great force.  The rungs of the ladder grow less stable toward the top of the mast.  Continuing upwards would be treacherous, as the integrity of the mast itself is damaged by the splintering caused by the break.  The ladder continues downward."
