  "description": [
    "The forest to the west has encroached to the base of the western wall, tall trees standing like silent sentinels awaiting orders.  A lone oak has fallen over and sags against the wall, its dead upper branches barely clearing the top of the deteriorating crenels.  Ivy has begun its own assault, but has so far only managed to climb about halfway up the high wall.  Loose bits of stone mix with dead leaves in every available corner of the walkway."
