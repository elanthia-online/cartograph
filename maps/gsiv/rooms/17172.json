  "description": [
    "Brass wall-mounted sconces cast light upon the deep-red silk-covered walls.  A setting of chairs with a table, all made of dark modwir wood inlaid with vultite, rest next to a brass fireplace, filling the dark room with warmth.  A large featherbed covered with a snowcat fur throw and dark-red velvet pillows invites the weary traveler."
