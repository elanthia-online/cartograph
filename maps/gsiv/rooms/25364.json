    "Dozens of tables clad in pristine white linens fill this open dining space.  Fine china and stemware garnish the tall tables, while wooden dishware and utensils serve as place settings on the smaller tables.  A basket of kittens is tucked in a corner, but none seem to be moving, and an odd smell emanates from within.  Wooden sideboards set with colorful platters grace the northernmost wall."
