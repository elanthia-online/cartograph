    "Rushing water from nearby Gladiator Falls creates a soft roar, muffled by a baffle of tall, speckled alders lining this well-worn trail.  Pale violet lady slippers flourish at the base of the taller trees, their delicate blossoms gently shivering at the slightest breeze.  The trail splits here, with part of the path heading southwest to the waterfall."
