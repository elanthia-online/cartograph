    "The table is comfortably large and oval in shape.  Its top is beautifully inlaid with a pattern of wind instruments fashioned from the tiny bits of wood.  Beneath, the table's pedestal is carved in the likeness of a set of large panpipes, the longer of the tubes supporting the table's weight.  A small lantern sits on the top, throwing out a merry twinkle from its sapphire-tinted glass sides."
