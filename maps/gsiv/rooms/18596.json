    "Black iron candelabras are set below dark mahogany shelves, the candleflames sputtering softly.  A large crystal-paned counter is set against the western wall, its interior lined with velvet to cushion the beautiful wares inside.  Small chests are aligned in neat rows upon the floor, their gilted edges warping any light into strange patterns."
