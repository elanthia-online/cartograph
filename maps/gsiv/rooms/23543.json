    "This underground training area is framed by roughly hewn walls that have been carved out of the bedrock the fortress was built on.  One wall is covered with charts and maps, while another wall boasts a large sword display.  In the back of the room, a row of wooden training mannequins stands between a weapon storage rack and a pile of spare mannequin parts.  Several inches of clean, white sand cover a majority of the floor space.  A bamboo mat rests on the landing at the base of a set of carpeted steps that lead back up to the main floor."
