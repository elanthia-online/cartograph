    "On the north side of the wide alley running the length of the stable, a freshly-constructed low pinewood wall surrounds a damp grey flagstone floor to create a large stall.  Long-handled brushes stand at the ready next to white oak barrels filled with water that line the western wall, while horseshoe picks lay on the flagstones next to a simple red stool resting in the far east corner. Across the alley to the south, two stalls stand side by side."
