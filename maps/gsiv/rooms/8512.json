  "description": [
    "Along the circular path are more trees that have died from unnatural causes.  One has been scorched by fire until it died.  Its sap boiled out of the stumps of its branches, the leaves curled and turned to ash as they fell.  Another was denied water until it could no longer continue.  Here too, each tree has a small stone altar in front of it."
