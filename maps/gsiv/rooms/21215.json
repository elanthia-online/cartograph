    "Refurbished driftwood walls rise from a water-stained light pine floor.  Just above an elegantly woven reed mat hangs a multihued Vornavian silk tapestry, and a domed white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  A Vornavian silk-lined display case and a set of carved felwood shelves stand side by side in the middle of the room."
