    "Pine cases are stacked on pallets along either side of the tent's interior, leaving a moderate amount of walking space between them.  North leads to the tent's entryway, where the muted sounds of the festival can be heard, and south leads to the rear of the tent, where yet another grouping of pallets reside.  Positioned in the middle of the walkway, a carved pine wine list fitted with a wrought silver candle plate offers enough light to clearly see in either direction."
