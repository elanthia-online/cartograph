    "Ripples from a small underground lake gently lap at the black, muddy shore in this cavernous chamber.  Occasionally, soft splashes and gurgles resound, seeming to originate to the northwest.  The shore curves north and west from here, punctuated by tracks of humans and animals and by a slimy trail whose maker you would rather not come face to face with."
