    "A path of footprints leads to and from a nearby hut, though they sink deeper and deeper into the path as the mud becomes a bog of water and dirt.  Leaning down from tall trees of light bark, ferns cover the path in green, and more than several have broken off and fallen to the ground.  Shattered vials of bright red litter the sides of the path."
