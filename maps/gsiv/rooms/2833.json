    "Stone with vivid striations of color creates sloping walls which narrow as they lead into the shadows at the cave's back.  Heaps of dried pine needles are strewn about the rough floor, and a blackened ring near the entrance gives evidence of old fires.  The round opening leading outside is a flat facade of white, blanketed as it is with the raging blizzard and low clouds."
