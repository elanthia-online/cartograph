  "description": [
    "Stuffy and warm, this room is surrounded by canvas walls.  Gold thread weaves through the green fabric in a haphazard pattern, giving the walls a marbled look.  Low benches and woven rugs are scattered throughout the space.  A large wooden sign near the back of the room stands beside a single wooden chair.  Flickering in each corner, a lit torch adds the scent of smoke to the stale air.  A rectangular break in one curtain wall leads out of the room."
