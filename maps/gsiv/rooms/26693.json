  "description": [
    "A low, groaning, drawn-out vocalization echoes from some faraway point, followed by a shrill reply coming from somewhere nearby.  Freezing waves of water envelop you time and again with the back-and-forth rip of the current.  From within the black sandbar, part of an enormous cracked wooden treasure chest juts upward, but the lack of light makes it impossible to discern if there is anything inside."
