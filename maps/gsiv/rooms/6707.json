    "This spot is at the crest of an old rockslide, a few stray rocks still littering the ground.  It seems that they have been arranged into a definite pattern, though its meaning eludes you.  The rocky slope of the avalanche leads down to the northwest.  A trail leads upwards to a small plateau to the southeast."
