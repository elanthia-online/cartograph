  "description": [
    "A huge blood red sun shines malevolently over a cracked, dusty land.  A few bushes and scrub grasses fight for survival.  The remains of a large tree trunk stand just to the west, and a black hole looms to the east.  The landscape is dominated by hillocks of burnt ochre stone, and a stiff wind stirs the dust into heavy, tight cyclones.  The view wavers as if heat was rising from this purgatory, but nothing is felt, nor heard, nor smelled, nor tasted...only seen."
