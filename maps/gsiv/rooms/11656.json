    "The undulating, rock-strewn pathway follows a serpentine course through the small trees.  Although no hint of breeze can be detected, tendrils of the oddly chilly fog snake through the branches overhead.  The spiky-leafed plants in the undergrowth have been trampled down.  The wooden figurehead of a ship has been set into the rocky soil adjoining one of the taller trees."
