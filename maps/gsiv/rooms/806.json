    "The climb along the ridge requires exquisite care lest the traveler plummet down the sheer rocky slope, though the field of wildflowers on each side of the ridge looks soft enough to cushion a fall.  The stars gleam brightly through the thin mountain air, bathing the few clouds in the sky with an ethereal glow.",
