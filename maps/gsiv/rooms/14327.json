  "description": [
    "Here, at the top of the staircase, one has a commanding view of the area below.  The banisters sweeping down to the lower floor are intricately carved in a leaping fish motif and polished to a high luster.  A mahogany paneled hallway stretches off to the north, while the west wall across from the staircase is almost completely occupied by a large oak door."
