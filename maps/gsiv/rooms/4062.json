  "description": [
    "The roadway becomes almost impassible as it circles a burned-out stump sitting directly in its path.  Ramshackle dwellings sit crowded around the old stump, as if they are mesmerized by the senseless meander the pitiful excuse for a road is executing.  The hovels lurch shoulder to shoulder, like a stack of dominoes ready to topple over in a cascading heap."
