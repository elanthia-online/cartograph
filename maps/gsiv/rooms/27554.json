    "Resembling gargantuan swords, craggy volcanic glass spikes rise out of the water in the distance, their sharp edges slicing the water and destroying the threatening waves before they reach the black sand shore.  Tangles of seaweed form a high-tide ring several feet back from the lapping water, while a driftwood and dried-up anemone ring is set several feet further back.  Smooth stones laid out in a squarish shape hint that once in the lone beach's past there may have been a house or two in residence.",

Tangles of seaweed form a high tide ring several feet back from the lapping water, while a driftwood and dried-up anemone ring is set several feet further back.  Smooth stones laid out in a squarish shape flank a simple cottage and hint that once, there may have been more homes in residence here."
