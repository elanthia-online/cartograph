    "Large niches line the walls of this pristine marble room, each small alcove bearing numerous bronze hooks.  Cleaning implements hang from the hooks, all of them meticulously labeled and clean despite their purpose.  A large granite table dominates the center of the room with its top surface covered in cauldrons of various sizes and makes.  Along the lower shelf of the table rows of carefully placed alembics sit waiting for use."
