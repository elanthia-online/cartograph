    "A hole in the canopy of trees above allows a single ray of moonlight to poke through this dark place.  The moon reflecting on the fog gives an eerie glow to the area, in contrast to the surrounding valley.  The fog does not relent from the moonlight, but instead seems to swirl about the ray madly.",
    "A hole in the canopy of trees above allows a single beam of sunlight to poke through this dark place.  The sun reflecting on the fog is almost blinding, in contrast to the surrounding valley.  The fog does not relent from the sunlight, but instead seems to swirl about the beam madly."
