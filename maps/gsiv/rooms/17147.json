  "description": [
    "Several torches have been allowed to burn out near the end of the corridor.  The light from the remaining ones causes a series of odd shapes and shadows to dance along the walls and ceiling.  Every so often, the flames crackle and burst to twice their size.  Heavy breathing seems to emanate from the darkened corner at the end of the hallway.  On a peg flanked by a reinforced eahnor door and a reinforced faenor door, hangs a single key that can be used to unbolt each cell in this block."
