  "description": [
    "Oak planks form the wide platform that surrounds this towering tanik tree, as well as the lacquered railing.  Beneath the railing, a series of low shelves displays tiny vials of multi-hued dye.  Tacked to the lip of each shelf, and arranged just beneath each vial of dye, are thin swatches of silk dyed to match the colors in each vial.  Stretched between the railing and the edge of the silken banner roofing is a transparent sheet of gossamer."
