    "Assorted chests, barrels, and crates are piled around a short oak door, walling it off from the rest of the cargo hold.  One crate has been hastily pried open and a crooked wooden sign is posted above it, affixed to a large salt-stained chest turned on one end.  A narrow gap between two barrels leads out."
