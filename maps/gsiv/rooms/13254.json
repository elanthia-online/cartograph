    "Sweeping, graceful arcs in the domed ceiling spread from one ivory column to another, only enhancing the beautiful patterns incised along each fluted support.  An intricate circular mosaic of an ancient willow graces the deeply polished marble floor, its trailing vines and tiny leaves rendered in immaculate detail.  Three hallways lead away from the foyer, the subtle but undeniable scent of varying flowers drifting in from each."
