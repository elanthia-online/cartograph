    "Gurgling quietly, a thin silvery stream passes beneath a short ash-wood bridge here, as it flows on its way toward the river to the southwest.  The bridge itself has been built atop a sturdy alabaster foundation, its wooden railings and supports decorated to resemble marsh reeds and other waterside foliage.  A polished oak lamppost, bearing a large brass lantern, stands next to the bridge.",
