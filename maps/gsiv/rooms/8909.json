    "This is a cheery little shack, filled with light, the sound of birds outside and the heady scents of the herbs and flowers surrounding it.  A small fireplace burns brightly in the far wall.  White lace curtains adorn the windows, and a high fourposter bed sits invitingly in the corner.",
    "This cozy little shack is filled with shadows.  The chirping of crickets and the smells of herbs and flowers drift quietly through the darkened room.  A soft red light gleams from the coals in a fireplace in the far wall.  White lace curtains adorn the windows, and a high fourposter bed sits invitingly in the corner."
