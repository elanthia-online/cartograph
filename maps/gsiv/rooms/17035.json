    "Long curved grooves scar the floor, leading to the edge of a massive steel door.  The hinges are slightly warped, no longer providing the proper fit needed to allow the door to swing freely.  Two small torches stand proudly on either side, leaving the hall ceiling to slowly blacken with their soot."
