  "description": [
    "The grass in this area is heavily trod and has a few patches missing.  A round wooden table seems to be the focus point of several wooden chairs, and a canvas covering has been stretched between four poles to both shade the area from the sun and protect it from rain.  A single freestanding torch placed a bit out from the overhang provides ample light."
