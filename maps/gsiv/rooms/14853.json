  "description": [
    "An imposing double row of poplars line a moonlit lane that materializes out of grassy meadows like the beginning of a sweeping line of charcoal in an artist's sketch.  Just at the lane's birth stands a statue.  Depicting a doe, the sculpture lifts its head as though just surprised at something carried on the breeze, the animal's elegant form limed in the soft moonlight.",
