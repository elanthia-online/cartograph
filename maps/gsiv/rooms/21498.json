    "The room is dimly illuminated by a single multi-wick pillar candle melted in place within a wide smudged glass column located in the center of a small chipped marble fountain.  The sound of the water's movement is light, but constant.  Several reed mats are scattered across the dirty floor.  Aside from the door you entered through, there is no other means of egress."
