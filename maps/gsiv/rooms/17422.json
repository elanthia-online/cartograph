  "description": [
    "Eerie stillness lingers on the air, heavy as the scent of wormwood incense drifting up from the chamber below.  Walls and a floor composed of highly polished brass reflect the dim luminescence washing off of a perfect silver sphere, its myriad reflections causing strange and dizzying tricks of the light.  The orb stands atop an ornately wrought brass bracket at the center of the chamber."
