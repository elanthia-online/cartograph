    "Tall conifer and pine trees dwarf the houses dotting the landscape, dropping massive cones everywhere.  Fallen needles and sprigs are so thick in some places that it resembles a heavy grassy carpet found in more temperate climes.  Some of the lower, heavier branches are missing, perhaps having become fodder for the many fireplaces in town."
