    "Stacks of wooden boxes and crates are piled high around the small room overflowing with a wide assortment of trinkets.  Various bits and pieces of curiosity are stuffed inside several dust-covered display cases.  The walls are lined with wooden shelves cluttered with a tangle of items.  Attendants wander in and out of the aisles, pausing to peer inside a container before resuming their search."
