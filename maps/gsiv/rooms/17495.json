  "description": [
    "An oval pattern in the ground has been cleared away, and an ice sculpture of two males, each grasping the forearm of the other in apparent friendship, is set in its center.  Tables and benches are scattered around the meadow, and vases with a single snow pansy are placed on the tabletops, serving as centerpieces.  The meadow is speckled with plants bearing a wooly, whitish down on their flower heads."
