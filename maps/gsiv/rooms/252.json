    "From here, the vista along the horizon affords a view of both banks of the river.  To the west, the dark expanse of the town's low skyline is dominated by rambling structures and a few towers.  To the east lies the bridge across the Locksmehr, spanning the dark waters to the less-populated east bank.",
