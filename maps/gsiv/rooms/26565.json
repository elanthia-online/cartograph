  "description": [
    "The pitch of the ceiling leading from the great room plummets to create something of a shallow and narrow passage that terminates in this confined circular space.  At the center is a tiered wooden table set with a variety of pleasantries for the nearby guestrooms, as well as a small dark metal sculpture that sits on the topmost shelf.  Several old paintings adorn the walls, their frames scuffed and tarnished and their faces cracked and chipping."
