  "description": [
    "The verdant drape of leaf cover here is thick, shading this section of the tree in a cool dimness.  Minute glowing orbs flit among the branches, illuminating the shade with a light that is neither harsh nor overly bright.  Tucked amid the limbs is a lavender velvet hammock with a square blackthorn trunk beneath, and a hand-stitched quilt is draped across the the back of the chair that sits off to the side.  A circular rug of wool cushions the floor underfoot, and above, silver chimes of stars sing quietly with the slightest breeze."
