    "Hanging from stout iron rings jutting from the ceiling are a handful of sturdy invar cages housing phosphorescent blue-green moss.  The faint light illuminates the wares displayed on shelves draped with canvas, and very little else in this small room.  A scarred, grey-bearded dwarf leans nonchalantly in the corner, sharpening his dagger."
