    "This northern portion of the common room is separated from the main by several folded screens of dark oak and golden silk.  Resting against the wall is a long pine table, coupled with several high-backed padded chairs stained a dark chestnut hue.  Recesses with scalloped arches are set in even intervals within the walls, each sporting a black iron sconce, with tall candles exuding faint curls of smoke.  Tucked in one such recess is an oak door, while opposite, another reveals a stone staircase that blends with the wall."
