    "The ceiling slopes low towards the floor on either side of a round dormer window.  Twin beds with thick down comforters are set to either side of the window, where the ceiling merges with the walls.  A white snowcat fur rug covers the floor between the beds.  Simple cedar chests are at the foot of each bed, filling the air with an agreeably woodsy scent each time their lids are raised."
