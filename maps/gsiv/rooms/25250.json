    "Virescent flames are held back by the thick crystal of the northern wall, illuminating a massive, circular vat at the center of the high-ceilinged room.  The vessel is ringed by a star formed of five steel tables.  Sour air, almost noxious with the astringence of strange chemicals, settles heavily over the surroundings, dragging along a too-sweet aftertaste of rot.  Overseeing the entire scene is an unnaturally detailed statue of a scaled man, his features half-hidden in shadow."
