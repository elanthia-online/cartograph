  "description": [
    "A huge, crudely lettered sign greets all who enter with the banner, \"Close-out sale!  Prices slashed!  All rugs 75% off!\"  Deep piles of brightly patterned carpets stand around the chamber, some with the upper-most rugs turned back to reveal others lying beneath them.  The heavy tribal pieces are thick and give off a unique odor.  And each has its own pattern, a unique design composed of thousands of pieces of wool thread hand-knotted to a tapestry backing."
