    "Three large stone windows make up the expanse of the southern wall, and through them the hot humid air of the jungle outside flows in.  Moss covers much of the surface area, dotted with small white flowers, and fed by a small pool of water created by a constant dripping from a crack in the wall.  Only the floor space leading up to and around a workbench remains uncovered."
