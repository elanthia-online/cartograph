    "The stone walls are smooth and covered with faint, yet meticulously-detailed wards that periodically shimmer with pale silver light.  The glow from the rune-etched walls bathes the entire circular chamber in a soft luminosity.  The very air crackles with a powerful energy, as the occasional spark of lightning dances harmlessly across the high-domed ceiling."
