    "The trail meanders through a copse of trees, at the center of which is an ancient oak.  It remains standing, yet it no longer lives, its trunk is blackened and burned from a devastating strike of lightning.  Its limbs are devoid of leaves and the jagged branches reach toward the traitorous sky in a final futile gesture of defiance."
