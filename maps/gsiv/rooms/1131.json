    "A massive maple tree stands just off the trail to one side.  Its trunk must be eight feet wide, and it clearly towers over all the nearby trees.  The position of stature has cost it severely, though, and it looks to be dying.  A long, jagged black mark begins at the top of the tree and rushes down the side all the way to the ground, and the branches near it are blackened stumps.  The other sides still have a complete set of branches, but only a few leaves cling to the far ends."
