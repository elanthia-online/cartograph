    "The walls of the bedroom are painted a deep shade of blue.  Pushed up against the north wall is a massive oak bed with an old sea chest, replete with carvings, positioned at the foot of it.  An over-stuffed armchair occupies a quiet corner.  A window opposite the bed lets in moonlight, which shines through the red curtains and gives the room a soft rosy glow.",
