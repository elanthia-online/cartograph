    "Shards of shattered glass crackle as you make your way across this loft of the inn, which appears to have been plundered and left unrepaired.  A rope ladder dangles from the skylight above.  There is no longer anything here of value, only cobwebs, rain-warped floorboards and the odor of rotting wood."
