    "Enclosed by golden-hued linden walls, the shop features an open linden treasure chest nearly overflowing with emeralds in the center of its linden plank floor.  A beautiful cluster of golden linden flowers hangs under the silk-draped ceiling.  Right near the front is an emerald-inlaid linden table and a gold-veined green marble counter."
