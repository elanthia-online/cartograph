    "The pathway ends abruptly in a large, shallow pool.  Reflected in the still surface of the water are dozens of skeletons impaled on wooden spikes that have been driven into the pool's bed.  Many of the skeletons are incomplete, held together by the threads and rags of faded uniforms or wire used to bound the hands and feet of victims.  Ash grey kingfishers rest on the tips of the spikes and skulls, scanning the water for meals and occasionally sharpening their beaks on their perches.",
