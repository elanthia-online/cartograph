    "This is a small cavern of some kind, possibly carved in the rock by an underground stream.  Thick tree roots have penetrated the cavern and hang down like moist fingers from the ceiling.  Above you is a circular hole, which you could likely climb out of.  A steep, dark passageway leads down deeper into the cavern."
