    "Verdant green moss forms an organic carpet along the northeastern edge of the pathway, the fuzzy blend terminating at a granite ring of smooth stones that create a border to small pools that house koi fish and lily pads.  Rising from the standing water, and seeming to glow in the moonlight, a towering and ancient haon tree stretches its limbs towards the sky."
