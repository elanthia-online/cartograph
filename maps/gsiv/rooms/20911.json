  "description": [
    "A sea of tall grasses wilts in the hot, humid air.  North and south the jungle rises upon an upland ridge, far too steep and straight to climb.  This valley appears the result of an ancient cirque, likely formed as over time the elements of nature restructured the mountains beyond.  A step-like series of ledges grant access to the northwestern highlands, while the vegetation clears somewhat to the southeast, revealing the shallows of a saltwater river."
