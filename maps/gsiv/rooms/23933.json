    "Hundreds of lightly scented candles glow and create a spectacular sight, their drippings lining the walls and floor of this natural cavern.  Despite the smoke funnelling up a vent hole in the ceiling, the room remains steamy from a heated pool.  The gleam of the candles illuminates, but also creates flickering shadows on the walls that, combined with the wavy reflected water designs, are naturally mesmerizing and relaxing.  Benches, painstakingly carved and worn smooth, ring the edge of water's surface."
