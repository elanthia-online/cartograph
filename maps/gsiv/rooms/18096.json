    "The wagon's interior is sparse in decoration, leaving the focus on its wares.  The numerous and varied merchandise spreads across a long slab of obsidian resting on two upturned wine barrels, a silk-covered crate, and a series of teak and onyx shelves.  Hanging from the bent birch poles that give the canvas covering its shape is a piece of silver-chased vellum."
