  "description": [
    "Three windows rise from the polished teak floor of the corridor towards the distant shadows of the high ceiling and are surrounded by large white shutters, which have been left open to allow the tropical air to flow freely through the area.  Settees and divans speckle the center of the floor, while the northern wall is covered with white birch bookcases that range in size and shape.  A series of frosted glass globes dangle from the rafters at various heights to provide a bounty of illumination during all times of the day."
