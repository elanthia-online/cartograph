    "From high overhead come the screams of massive blood eagles.  The great birds circle slowly above the Citadel, casting their massive shadows down across the battlement as they pass between the moonlit sky and the ground.  The night is periodically interrupted as one of the winged beasts appears from over the horizon, screams in pleasure, and releases an unfortunate victim from a great height to plummet to the earth below."
