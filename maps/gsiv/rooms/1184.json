    "The wind ripples through the trees to create a wistful sighing sound.  The air is warm and dry, and the sky is full of stars and devoid of clouds.  No rain threatens this peaceful scene.  The river rushes by below, its roar muted by the face of the bluff.  Near the edge of the bluff, fragrant alyssum plants fill the air with a slightly sweet aroma.  The trail ahead is level and dry.  It is a perfect night for a journey to far off places.",

The river rushes by below, its roar muted by the face of the bluff.  Near the edge of the bluff, fragrant alyssum plants fill the air with a slightly sweet aroma.  The trail ahead is level and dry.
