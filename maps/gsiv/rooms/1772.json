    "Upon entering this shop, the high beamed ceiling gives a false impression of ample space.  Maps of exotic rug-weaving regions where villagers create precious coverings are prominently displayed on the smooth sandstone walls.  On highly polished and slightly cluttered maoral shelves, an astounding array of color, intricate design and texture is exhibited for the perusal of would-be customers."
