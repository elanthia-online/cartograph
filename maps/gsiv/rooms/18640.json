    "The silence here is profound.  Two statues, one of a winged mermaid and the other of a wild-eyed woman gazing up at the moon, sit in the two back corners of the room.  A small pile of fish tails, broken driftwood dolls, and other symbols of sailor wife curses sits before the mermaid, whose look of beautiful impartiality barely pays them notice."
