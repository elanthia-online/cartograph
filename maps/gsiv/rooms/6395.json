  "description": [
    "A faint, greenish light fills this cavern.  You notice that the light stems from the lichen-covered walls.  In spaces between the lichen, flow a few grainy rivulets.  The ground is covered with heaps of dark grit, which makes walking rather difficult.  A jagged crevice can be seen in the shadows."
