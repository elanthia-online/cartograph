    "An overgrown bramble bush clings to life against the side of the cliff just to the west, blocking further passage in that direction with its long thorns and tightly woven branches.  A sparse collection of leaves clings to the ends of the branches, and the bush does not look to be in a robust state of health.  Perhaps the lack of sunlight coupled with the cold, damp conditions have something to do with its predicament."
