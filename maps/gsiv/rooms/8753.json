    "A majestic tree stands before you, larger than any other tree in the entire Landing.  The bright green leaves are bigger than a giantman's hand, and the branches appear to cradle whole rooms in their gigantic embrace!  A soft light glows from the various knotholes and windows set in the tree.  A door set under a large archway formed from living wood leads into the trunk."
