    "An elaborately detailed map is framed and mounted on the wall, its warped and tattered edges pressed for protection beneath the glass.  Opposite, a series of small, irregular holes pierces the stone near the ceiling, allowing occasional breaths of fresh air to filter in.  A deep, round niche in the stone holds an oil lamp with a stormy blue-hued shade."
