    "The small stone chamber is crowded at best, crammed with a nearly endless supply of stone blocks, wooden crates, and overturned chests.  The room appears to be more of a forgotten storage area than any space worth residing in for long.  Cobwebs clutter the corners of the scrunched space and the floor is covered with dust, broken up only by some fresh footprints moving to and fro."
