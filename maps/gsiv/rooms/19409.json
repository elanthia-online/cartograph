    "An elongated lacquered counter divides the area in half, cutting off customers from the back where a huge stockpile of staves, crooks, and canes have collected.  Standing behind the counter are a pair of halfling twins, each identically garbed in floppy wizard hats and matching red and blue robes.  A few glass lanterns hang from the tent's ceiling, creating a soft glow to the little room."
