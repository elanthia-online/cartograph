    "The flickering glow of candlelight gives this study a cozy feeling.  The walls and floor are decorated with skins and tapestries.  On one wall, a small metal birdcage sits near a large window that overlooks the gardens of Cairnfang Manor.  A tiny wooden desk sits in one corner, covered in books and bits of paper.  Old leaves, broken quills, and books litter the floor around it.  A strange scent hangs in the air."
