  "description": [
    "A few small trees flourish in the warmer climate, unable to survive in the frigid temperatures outside Dervish Park.  Beds of exotic flowers grow amongst the exposed roots, in turn edged by low-cut ground cover and carefully groomed bushes.  A narrow gravel trail winds about, then loops back upon itself headed towards the entrance to the park."
