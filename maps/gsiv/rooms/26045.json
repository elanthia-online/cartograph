    "Beautiful cream marble covers the counters of this large, spacious kitchen, and brightly painted crocks and bowls are scattered over the surfaces.  An enormous white brick fireplace is lined with dark tiles and set with cast iron fixtures.  Beautiful crimson porcelain dishes are stacked neatly in dark ebonwood cupboards, their edges trimmed with gold.  A deep pantry lined with shelves holds food of all variety."
