    "A pathway of crushed oyster shells, barely visible in the thick scrub grass, leads northeast and south following a high stucco wall.  Behind the wall a tall, damaged tower with a blue-tiled roof can be seen.  A marshy gully bars any passage to the north, but a thin trail through the grass leads northwest, down into the gully."
