    "Mounted animal heads on carved wooden plaques line the walls painted completely red with a series of black splotches on this side of the shop, contrasting with the rest of the color scheme.  Carved out of the crimson carpet is a circular section with a short, faded mannequin sitting at the center.  A single strip of black carpet shaped like an arrow leads back to the foyer."
