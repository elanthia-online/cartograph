  "description": [
    "Encased by a small railing, the curving road affords an unobstructed view of the sea and sky.  Rough stone stairs descend to the local beach, their smooth faces carved right into the bedrock of the cliff-face and flanked by a looped rope railing anchored with driftwood.  Bright glaesine lanterns rest dormant upon their wrought iron pedestals as their reflected light creates rainbow patterns on an elegantly appointed bar."
