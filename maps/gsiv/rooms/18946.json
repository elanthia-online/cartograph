    "Moonlight slants through the driftwood-framed windows that break up the stark white monotony of the limestone walls.  Orderly rows of alchemy devices placed upon a white-washed oak workbench gleam in the golden light and provide ample illumination for the tiny alcove.  A dark ebon curtain is framed by brass lanterns, which currently burn brightly."
