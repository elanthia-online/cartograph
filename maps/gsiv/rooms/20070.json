    "Dark green vines pour in from the entrance of the mausoleum and creep across the surface of the granite structure.  From just outside, the faint glow of the cerulean flames barely illuminates the interior, causing shadows to flicker across the far wall.  Due to the mausoleum sinking, the floor is at an uneven angle, heading toward a crumbling granite archway leading deeper inside."
