    "A crew of halflings is building a house off to the side of the road, filling the air with banging and cheerful banter.  You are forced to step over the boards and buckets of nails that line the street and you must constantly shake wood shavings from your hair.  Examining the chaos the building has created, you briefly wonder how anything gets done here.",
