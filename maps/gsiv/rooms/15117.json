    "The broad sweep of the marble floor is interrupted by a brilliantly hued woven floor tapestry depicting a soaring red dragon against a star-filled night.  Halfway to the amber dome ceiling, a trio of flickering carved red coral snarling dragon sconces hangs on one of the honey-hued amber walls.  A kidney-shaped cream-banded red agate table and a plush red velvet divan are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
