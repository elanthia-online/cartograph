  "description": [
    "Thick tangles of thorn-heavy brambles lie in knotted clusters along the western border of the pathway that bisects the swamp.  Several puddles of stagnant water pockmark the thick carpet of dusky brown moss that spreads across the uneven ground.  A ring of half-rotted trees leans against each other, their splintered sides and barkless faces heavy with black mold and sludge."
