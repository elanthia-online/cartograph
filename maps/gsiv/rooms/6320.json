    "A semi-circle of rocks covered thickly with moss makes a private retreat from the hubbub of the merrymaking within the tent nearby.  A gently rounded stone shelf serves as a bench made by some long forgotten craftsmen or a kindly nature.  The noise and strife of adventuring seem far away and almost forgotten in this island of tranquility."
