    "A few small logs burn in the firepit, casting strange shadows that dance against the uneven stone walls of the cavern.  The flickering light illuminates a crude painting on the wall.  A tiny rivulet of water trickles down the stone wall into a crude basin that has been hollowed out of the stone.  The only furnishings are a simple bed of maoral wood and a small matching table.  A statuette stands on the small table."
