    "Branches of pine trees reach out like ghostly arms dripping with a frosting of ice crystals.  They sag slightly under the weight of the snow, and as an occasional clump falls off, it causes the limb to spring up, creating a miniature wintry squall.  Nearby stands the massive walls that cordon off the town and several birds perch along the top, taking advantage of its cleared, windswept surface.",
    "Branches of pine trees reach out like ghostly arms dripping with a frosting of ice crystals.  Their massive forms are silhouetted by the darkness of night, creating little coves of shadow.  Nearby, the massive walls that cordon off the town block any other source of illumination, except for the rare glow from a second story window."
