  "description": [
    "A few small pens have been erected against the back of the blockhouse, their split pine rails secured with rope-like vines.  Loose straw covers the hard-packed earth, perhaps to create a comfortable resting place--but there are no signs to indicate what animals inhabited the pens.  A rickety wooden ladder leans against the outer wall, providing access to the northern gallery."
