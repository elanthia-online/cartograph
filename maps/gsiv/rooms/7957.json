    "The first thing you notice is the strong scent of poorly distilled alcohol.  Crude clay jugs are tipped over about the room, the liquid spilled on the rough sleeping pallets.  In some places, the drink seems to have eaten through the cloth, but moths could be responsible for the holes as well.   Weapons lean in the corners, in varying states of disrepair."
