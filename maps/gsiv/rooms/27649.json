    "Crowded with broken furniture and discarded shoeboxes, a small space has been cleared around a dye-splattered tub.  A long-tailed sewer rat is perched on the edge of the tub, the rodent's feet stained an odd shade of blue.  Near a small window, a wire basket hangs from a low ceiling riddled with holes."
