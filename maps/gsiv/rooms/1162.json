    "Directly across the river very few trees stand among the rolling maze of holly, raspberry, thistle and other assorted bushes and vines.  Those trees that do stand are blackened, although a few of them still have slight growths to indicate that they have weathered the passing conflagration.  Further in the distance the Khohallatain Forest rears up in a line, and perhaps the fire was stopped by the river or by a timely thunderstorm."
