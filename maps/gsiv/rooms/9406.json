    "The tunnel spur ends quickly at a black metal door.  The door looks anything but ordinary, sporting three heavy hinges on its left side and a turnbuckle opening device.  Firelight flickers brightly beyond the door, and warm air streams out of the doorway into the room.  Two green toadstools in large stone pots flank the doorway and cast their illumination across the ceiling."
