    "Dark shadows play across the smooth face of the bulwark as the torches from the west begin to lose their friendly glow at this distance.  Biting winds whip through the air and lend their unearthly voice of that of the pained howls of some craven creature that prowls disturbingly close.  The ravaged remains of a tree that dared to grow too close to the fortress's walls lays discarded in the upturned cobblestones of the ground."
