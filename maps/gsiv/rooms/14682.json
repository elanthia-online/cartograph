  "description": [
    "Resting high on the west wall of the manor, the source of the pleasant scent in the air is spread along the limestone railing at the edge of the balcony.  Climbing roses peek through the railing and draw the eye to the sight of the garden below.  Comfortable lounging chairs have been drawn up to the railing's edge and a table and chairs stand ready to hold an informal repast."
