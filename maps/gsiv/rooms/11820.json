    "A massive wall of earth and vegetation casts deep shadows on each side of the road, and continues on like two hulking black snakes, slithering off to the east and west.  To the north the ruined walls and towers of a large city appear as dark silhouettes against the night sky.",
    "A massive wall of earth and vegetation extends on each side of the road and continues on to the east and the west.  Here and there, through the obscuring layer of dirt can be seen a gleaming patch of white.  To the north the ruined walls and towers of a large city struggle valiantly beneath the weight of the encroaching forest."
