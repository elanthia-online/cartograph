  "description": [
    "Small shops and houses line either side of the street, each adorned with a single lantern post.  The road becomes less traveled to the north, comprised of thick mud with large sprouts of dark vegetation.  Carrion bird calls echo noisily from nearby rooftops, but there is no other sign of bird or nest."
