    "Dense green shrouds the river path almost into obscurity, where ferns hang down in large clumps and shoots of growth pop up from the moist, mud-ridden soil.  Sailing along smoothly, the river streams past to one side, its calm surface barely marred by the current.  From high up in the canopy, far above the tall bamboo shoots that reach up into the cover of foliage, the sounds of birds calling out fill the air."
