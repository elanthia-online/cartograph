    "The rustling leaves of haon trees overhead and a swiftly flowing creek beside this path create a quiet symphony.  To the south, a footbridge crosses the creek amidst a smaller forest of reeds.  A clearing is visible in the forest to the north, where the creek seems to originate.  Occasional soft voices can be heard from that direction, heightening the feeling of peace that seems to permeate this woodland haven.  A well worn path heads into the trees, ending at the foot of a large haon tree."
