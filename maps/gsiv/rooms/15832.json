    "A midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the pale oak walls, and a varnished oak ceiling rises overhead.  A thin gold-edge black runner sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a long carved oak counter on one side of the shop and a Vornavian silk-lined display case on the other."
