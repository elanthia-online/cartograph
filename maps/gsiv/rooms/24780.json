    "Beneath a stormy grey marble ceiling, a panoramic war mural spans the entire length of the room's circular walls. Some curvaceous female warrior statuary rings the edge of the room, their oversized weapons braced against the crimson marble floor.  Flanking the entrance at facing angles are a stout iron weapon rack and a sturdy iron armor stand."
