    "The white marble walls and floor are softened by a pair of tapestries and a blackworked woolen rug.  One tapestry is woven with the image of the exterior of White Haven, the town's first Great House, and the other depicts a gathering of adventurers in Town Center preparing for a quest.  Some bookshelves against the wall hold a library of books and ledgers, and a low desk stands in the center of the room, behind which stands the house clerk."
