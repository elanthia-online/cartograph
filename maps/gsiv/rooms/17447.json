    "The inner lining of the tent is leather, wrapped one layer upon the next, and insulated by heavy pelts placed here and there.  Bowed beams arch overhead, creating a frame and supporting the structure as tufts of animal fur in tawny hues peek out from between the leather layers.  A richly toned wildcat fur drapes the opening in the front of the tent, providing a means of exit as well as a barrier against the outside."
