    "The cramped cabin smells of mold and seawater, with heavy pieces of dark wooden furniture dwarfing the contents of this tiny shop.  A tall oak dresser stands nearby, with pieces of fabric peeping out of an open drawer.  Against one wall a splintered maple table stands alone, while a wooden chest and a polished brass trunk encroach on the middle of the room.  Between the furniture a warped wooden door leads out."
