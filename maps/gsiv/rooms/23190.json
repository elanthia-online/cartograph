    "Completely secluded from the activity of the adjacent Lysierian Hills, peace and tranquility have made this robust and thriving garden their home.  Sectioned off into three quadrants, a colorful bed of fruit, vegetables, and flowers, blooms healthily and appears capable of sustaining a well-sized community.  Squat wooden benches rest beneath a magnificent weeping willow tree, the elegant curtains of drooped branches offering shade from the open sky above."
