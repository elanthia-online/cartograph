    "Cavernous, high walls surround you, arcing upwards into darkness.  Lurid crimson torchlight ripples across the slightly damp stone walls, casting a dark scarlet sheen across the surroundings.  Several well-polished tunnels lead away from the central chamber, and dark velvet rugs flanked by intricate iron candelabras trail in their wake.  A complex, circular design of sigils loop and arc across the center of the room, their intricacy rather weathered by the passage of time."
