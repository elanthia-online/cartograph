    "A maze of overstuffed armchairs and delicate end tables makes navigation through this room a tricky proposition.  Heavy celadon velvet drapes cover the windows and pool on the dark floor beneath.  Displayed atop the red marble fireplace is a collection of glass plates filled with bright pinwheels of color."
