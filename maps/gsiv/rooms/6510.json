    "Stands of tall ash trees border the road, interspersed with delicate flowering dogwoods.  The way is furrowed and prodigious potholes are the rule instead of the exception.  A large boulder, its veined surface encrusted with a frieze of lichens, forces the track to curve in a southeasterly direction."
