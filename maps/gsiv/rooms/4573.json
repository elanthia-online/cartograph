    "This shallow valley is covered in a blue-white snowfield.  On the far side, a wall of broken rocks emerges from the dense white surface to begin the climb up the next peak.  If there is a passable trail, it is not visible at this distance.  Here, the mountain face is a smooth rock surface pierced with faint lines."
