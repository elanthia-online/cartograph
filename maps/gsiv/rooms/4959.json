  "description": [
    "Finding footholds along this steep path is difficult, as it climbs nearly straight up into the DragonSpine Mountains.  You scramble to keep upright as loose rocks slip underneath your feet, and there is little to hold onto for balance.  The path seems to disappear into silvery mists above.  The downward direction looks somewhat safer, as you can see a rocky trail below that follows the mountain pass.",
    "Finding your footing along this path is made difficult by the shadows moving across the area.  Loose rocks and earth further hinder efforts to climb further up the path.  Moonlight illuminates the silvery mist into which the path ascends.  Below, the rocky trail follows the mountain pass."
