    "A lava flow blocks the passage to the southwest, yet you can see the cavern continues further on the other side.  The pouring stream of fresh lava builds a wall of heat that would turn back all but those of great resolve.  The ash shifts beneath your feet the closer you edge towards the lava flow."
