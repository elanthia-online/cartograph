  "description": [
    "A high ceiling rises in a curving upwards arc, the stone tinted a soft shade of white reminiscent of summer clouds.  Subtle engravings mark the white stone, their simplistic wavy forms looking like currents of gentle wind.  The flowing patterns of air coalesce around the statue of a winged man with a boyish grin on his face standing to the southwest.  A mottled blue and misty grey altar stands before the man, an open tome resting upon its whorled surface."
