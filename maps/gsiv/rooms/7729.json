  "description": [
    "Seven crude limestone obelisks stand peculiarly out of place, apparently cut from nearby stalagmites and arranged into a small circle in some long-forgotten ceremony.  A towering chimney breaks the roof above the monoliths, allowing a distant glimpse of starlit sky.  As drafts of wind whistle downward through the stone passage, the higher galleries produce a resonant hum, culminating in an ethereal song that echoes throughout the cavern.",

A towering chimney breaks the roof above the monoliths, allowing a distant glimpse of blue sky.
