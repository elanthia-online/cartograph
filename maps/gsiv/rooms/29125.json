    "Hazy moonlight filters through the entrance flap of the modest tent, assisting the dusty oil lamps set about the shop to provide some illumination against the night shadows.  The corners of the shop are filled with piles of exotic goods and a large expensive rug stretches across the ground.  A long glass counter serves as the focal point and a curtain of colorful glass beads offers access to the backroom."
