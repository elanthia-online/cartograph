  "description": [
    "A haggard oak rises from the grassy clearing, its branches heavy with brittle leaves which crackle in the slight breeze.  Affixed to woven cords which dangle from its limbs, circular objects ranging from the size of a small buckler to the length of a kite shield sway back and forth with the movement of the tree."
