    "The lean, oily-looking human standing behind the low counter glances up from polishing his locksmithing tools and pushes his dark, greasy hair back from his face as you enter.  Disorganized stacks of wood and metal doors rest against the walls, most with their hinges broken or skillfully dismantled."
