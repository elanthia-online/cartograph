    "The armory is brightly lit with cast iron braziers placed in each corner.  A wide variety of weapons and armor kept in good working condition are hung across each wall with the sole exception of one.  A barren lor wall stands out and has a single ko'nag door.  Flanked to the right side of the door is an encased illthorn armor stand, whilst the left side holds a matching illthorn weapon rack.  The middle of the spacious armory is open, leaving room to spar or exercise on the polished ironwood floor."
