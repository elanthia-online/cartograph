  "description": [
    "Pools of amber light reveal where lanterns have been recently lit, but many of the glassed globes suspended from the ceiling beams have been extinguished.  Within the shadowed reaches between the beams, faintly phosphorescent lichen furs the planes of the bare rock, softening its angles into curves.  The smooth floor of the tunnel slopes down to the southwest."
