    "Small baskets of handcrafted jewelry sit about the interior of this tent.  Torques, wrought belts, but most especially armbands glitter in the low light, all made by the hands of a master.  The proprietor of the shop sits behind a well-worn bench, painstakingly tapping out patterns on a band of gold."
