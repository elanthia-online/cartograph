    "Large bales of bound hay create a small wall around the enclosure that keeps the patchwork rabbit inside, while allowing the jungle-like foliage of the island to trickle onto the emerald lawns.  Small, cobalt blue bowls offer water for the plump denizen, while a purple awning, stretched between two trees, offers the tiny creature protection from the elements."
