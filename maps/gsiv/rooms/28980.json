  "description": [
    "Spread throughout the quiet alcove, several tables are illuminated by solitary candles placed on their dark green felt-covered surfaces.  Copper-legged bar stools with high backs and leather seats stretch out in front of a long mahogany bar that is laden with an assortment of snacks and beverages.  White whorls decorate the blue rug that fills the alcove, the thick cushioning muffling the sound of footfalls and muting the voices of visitors at the gaming tables."
