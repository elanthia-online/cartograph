    "Primarily used for storage, the narrow room is cluttered with various items.  Rolled-up documents and maps are haphazardly placed along the shelves that line the wall, which are hard to make out with the poor lighting.  A linen-covered driftwood crate rests against the back wall, while a jewel-studded ironwood chest is pushed up against a large pile of old canvas rags."
