    "Simplistic in design, the interior of the room is lit by strategically placed holes bored into the walls, creating an intricate criss-cross pattern as sunlight streams through their small openings.  Yellow-tinged wood, splotched with pale green lichen clusters, adds a natural decorative adornment that compliments the mottled brown tones dominating the room.  An elaborate wing design has been burned into a thin wooden board, the piece hanging over an oversized trunk fashioned from rough-hewn beech.",
