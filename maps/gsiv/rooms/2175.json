  "description": [
    "White-washed haon walls give the room an airy feel, bounded along the ceiling and floor with bands of pink and green marble.  A round window imbedded with shards of rainbow quartz and cabochons of lavender shimmarglin sapphire looks out on the street below.  One large central maple desk fronts this charming office, framed by twin bookcases against the wall behind it.  A loomed rug depicts the Ta'Illistim Masters of Lore, some teaching, some practicing their craft, in intricate detail."
