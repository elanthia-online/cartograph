    "A small rise lifts you high above the rest of the tundra here.  Squinting against the blowing snow, you gaze about and realize the view extends hundreds of miles in every direction.  Far off in the distance, Wehnimer's Landing is visible as a small speck on the shores of Darkstone Bay.",

Far off in the distance, the dim night lights of Wehnimer's Landing are visible as a small glow on the shores of Darkstone Bay."
