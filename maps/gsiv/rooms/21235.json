    "Refined oak-paneled walls rise from a varnished dark oak floor.  Just above a thin gold-edge black runner hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  A spacious grey slate counter and a beveled glass-covered case stand side by side in the middle of the room."
