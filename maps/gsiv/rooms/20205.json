    "A plush pale grey rug covers the majority of the plank flooring.  Spanning across the far wall, a wide four-poster bed carved from black gum wood is dressed with periwinkle and white bedding.  Issuing a shadowy, flickering illumination, copper sconces are lit with dim flames, several of which are clustered around a narrow door.  Above a tall armchair and a rustic table, the ceiling is warped inward in odd curving patterns."
