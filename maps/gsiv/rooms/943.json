    "The trail ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge.  The sound of rushing water echoes up the rock face from far below, as the water itself tumbles furiously on its way down the mountainside.  An old rope bridge extends across the gorge, disappearing at the far end into a dark opening in the sheer rocky cliff."
