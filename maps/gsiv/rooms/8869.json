    "Sunlight bounces off the red brick used for the chimneys in the surrounding houses, giving it a slight orange cast.  Cattails poke out of a small lily pond, waving gently in the breeze as small tassels puff away from the tops of their stalks.  The airborne seedlings waft away, so thick they look like a gentle snowfall."
