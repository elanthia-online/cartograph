    "Timepieces of all shapes and sizes line the shelves, cabinets, and tables in this uncomfortably cramped space.  A rhythmic ticking echoes hypnotically, threatening to send even the most sound-minded visitor into a disoriented trance.  Occasionally, the wagon's muted light takes on a deep red hue, the source not immediately apparent.  A small glass case bordered with sleek gold edges and a filigreed lock plate sits prominently atop an ornately carved fireleaf table.",
    "Timepieces of all shapes and sizes line the shelves, cabinets, and tables in this uncomfortably cramped space.  A rhythmic ticking echoes hypnotically, threatening to send even the most sound-minded visitor into a disoriented trance.  A short maoral table and a long oak table are flush against one wall, while an elm table and a birch table are positioned against an adjacent wall."
