  "description": [
    "Mismatched barstools showing signs of disrepair face a stained and badly damaged bar, which stands at the back of the taproom.  Hanging on a peg behind the bar is a loaded heavy crossbow, and a quiver filled with bolts leans against the wall.  Soot streaks blacken the walls where torches that provide some illumination to the room are chained.  A narrow staircase leads to the second floor."
