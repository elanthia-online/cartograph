    "The orlop terminates in a gilded red brass hatch in the northern bulkhead.  Fiery wings of gilt are painted onto the surrounding wood, spreading from the hatchway in a majestic span.  The crates and lines loading the orlop are cleared away from the entrance to allow easy access through the hatch."
