  "description": [
    "Rings of lurid scarlet torchlight illuminate the surroundings in stark detail -- flanking the rocky path are a variety of large bones, seemingly melded into one another to form a grisly, spiked caricature of a twisted spine.  The skeletal remains appear to be animal at the beginning of the path, though the ones further along have a distinctly humanoid appearance.  Far ahead, a circle of blue flames casts a ghostly light upon a small island further to the south."
