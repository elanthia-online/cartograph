  "description": [
    "An eerie quiet blankets the area like the deep shadow cast by the high palisade wall.  A bloated and one-eyed halfling kneels in front of a strange white tent, set back from the roadside.  The halfling skillfully carves into a slab of meaty flesh, separating it into tiny blocks.  The faint aroma of decay wafts out from the tent's flap."
