    "Moonlight shines off the blue barrel tiles that cover the top of the tower.  Many tiles have cracked and begun to crumble, others have been dislodged and fallen to the courtyard below.  The view is panoramic.  To the east lies the forest-covered mainland.  South and east are Maelstrom Bay and the very tip of the island of River's Rest.  To the west is the expanse of the bay and beyond it, the great western sea.",
