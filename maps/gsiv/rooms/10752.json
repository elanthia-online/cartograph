    "A multihued Vornavian silk tapestry hangs on one of the patterned white walls, and a paneled haon ceiling rises overhead.  A pile of striped throw pillows sits in one corner of a wide-plank glossy tanik floor.  There is a wicker basket on one side of the shop and an elegantly carved oak armoire on the other."
