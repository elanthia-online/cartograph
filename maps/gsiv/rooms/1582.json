    "A row of compact shops line the pier's north side, extending the South Market out over the Bay.  Lit by a series of torches along the pier, a shop with an assortment of helms, hats and hoods is hard not to notice.",
    "Solhaven's South Market Pier stretches to the west, guarded by shops fighting for space on an island severed from Solhaven proper by several feet of water.  Among the finest of the stores is a squat millinery situated near the meeting of the pier's planks and the paved stones of the isle.  Lit by a series of torches along the pier, the shop's assortment of helms, hats, and hoods displayed through its murky windows is difficult not to notice.  A stone bridge to the east joins the island with the South Market.",
