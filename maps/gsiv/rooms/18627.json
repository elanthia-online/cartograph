    "Dark silver filigree patterns flow across the wall, imitating the churning waves of the sea.  A gilted crystal-paned counter stands in the middle of the room, surrounded by several large open birchwood chests.  Numerous shelves line the closely-spaced walls, their surfaces draped with luxurious lengths of velvet to highlight the wares they hold."
