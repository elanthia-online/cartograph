    "Nestled in the sturdy boughs of a massive teak tree, this quaint boutique offers an assortment of fine accessories.  Tiny globes of colorful blown glass dangle from the canopy above, scattering rainbow light across wares.  A narrow wooden walkway leads further into the treetops, while a rope ladder allows access back down to the ground."
