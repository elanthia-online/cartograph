    "A small fire pit is on the shore of the lagoon here.  The burnt ends of firewood sit in a shallow, black puddle in the pit, the fire having long been spent.  Rocks large enough to serve as seats have been placed near the fire pit, and a small pile of unused wood sits near the edge of the woods to the east."
