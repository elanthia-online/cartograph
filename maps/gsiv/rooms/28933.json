    "Though some sunlight filters in through the entrance flap of the modest tent, the interior remains cool and shadowed.  The corners of the shop are filled with piles of exotic goods and a large expensive rug stretches across the ground.  A long glass counter serves as the focal point and a curtain of colorful glass beads offers access to the backroom."
