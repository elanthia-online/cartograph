    "What a clutter!  Stacks of odd baubles and weirdness abound.  A flame-red curtain hangs across one corner of the room, and odd pulses of light periodically flash across the ceiling.  A pillar of water flows perpetually into the tree from a strange contraption, bringing nourishment to the roots.  Exploring the rest of the library could take years, considering the sheer bulk of odds and ends scattered about."
