    "The chamber is small, but elegantly appointed with cast bronze sconces and woven tapestries, each hanging depicting a scene in a garden-set party.  One tapestry nearly obscures a tall portal.  Set in the middle of the room, alone, is a bronze-trimmed box with a display slipper resting upon it."
