    "As the trail winds back into dense forest, it grows more rocky underfoot.  In some places, it is necessary to traverse jumbles of boulders, as well as navigate through patches of nettles.  Some modwirs are mixed in with the hardwoods in this section of the woods, and their distinctive piney smell perfumes the crisp air."
