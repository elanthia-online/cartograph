    "The Trench turns, each subtlety of the curving face of rock lovingly adorned with elaborate spirals and interlocking designs, rendered by hands so skilled, one would think the unforgiving rock was as pliant as canvas.  Colors range from dun brown to rich sienna, and greys so alive, they defy their humble origins of black and white.  Mithril flecks in the stone are ever-present, catching the light shed by the braziers lining the walls like minute stars."
