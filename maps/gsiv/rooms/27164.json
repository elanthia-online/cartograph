    "Transitioning from narrow tunnels to wide open spaces, this section of the sewer bears an egg-shape and a domed ceiling, the height of which is difficult to ascertain.  Glowing white stones are fitted into niches high above and provide a soft illumination for the water-dampened confines.  Strange blocks jut out of the wall at varying heights, some of which form odd stone tables while others provide functional seating."
