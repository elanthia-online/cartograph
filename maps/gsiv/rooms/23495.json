    "Some drunk rapscallion of the past seems to have amended the sign to read \"The Favorful Bar\" instead of \"The Flavorful Bar.\"  Rather than objecting to the vandalism, the halfing bar maid seems to have embraced it, for some of the drinks are being sold in suspiciously familiar-looking white flasks, and large white shields have been stitched across the front of her taut, low-cut bodice.  A grizzled old halfling nurses a stein of tart rum as he leans on the polished maoral bar near a crate containing several souvenirs and leers enthusiastically."
