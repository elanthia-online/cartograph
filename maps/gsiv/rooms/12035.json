    "The irregular shadows of night darkened ruins spread out to the north of the pyramid.  Wide stone steps lead down to the streets below. Another set of steps lead up to the second level of the pyramid.",
    "Positioned above all the single story buildings of the city, it is possible to see the damage that time has wrought. Roofless walls, crumbling with age, spread out for many blocks to the north.  Wide stone steps lead down to the streets below. Another set of steps lead up to the second level of the pyramid."
