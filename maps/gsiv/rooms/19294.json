    "Wide fieldstone steps lead past a terra-cotta strawberry pot onto a veranda sheltered by latticework intertwined with ivy vines.  Patterns of shadows chase across the floor as sunlight filters through the emerald leaves.  A myriad of colorful flowers, planted in window boxes and hanging baskets, exude a fragrant perfume, born on a gentle breeze that rustles through the ivy and sets a wind chime tinkling.  A pot of blooming violets sits on a table placed next to a generous woven grapevine swing."
