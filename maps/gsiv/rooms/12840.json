    "Circling to the east is a well-maintained grey cobblestone road.  Lining the street at each end are decorative borders of chiseled black tentacle stars.  In the southern corner sprawls an iron kraken statue, draped by one of the many weeping willow tree branches that line the strand.  The street is littered with dead willow branches that have fallen to the ground and found refuge in the cracks of the stones.  Encircling the statue is a cobbled roundabout walkway, showcasing several private homes."
