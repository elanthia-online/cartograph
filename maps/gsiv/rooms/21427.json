    "Towering above the surrounding foliage, and reaching almost the height of a nearby banyan tree, is a tall bell-topped pole marked incrementally in black paint.  Smaller posts surrounding it are decorated with either black ribbons for failures or the blue ribbons of prize winners, their ends trailing to the muddy ground.  A large wooden-hafted mallet rests against the pole, with a burly muscular huckster looking on."
