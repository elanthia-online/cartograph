    "Casks, crates, barrels, cages, and baskets line the walls from floor to ceiling, each labeled with a different destination or marked with a single word denoting their contents.  Large chalkboard signs dominate the northern wall, the left-hand section listing ships and cargo to be delivered and the right-hand side denoting the daily specials and shop offerings.  An incredibly long counter separates the storage and store space from the wall-hugging signs, while doors in the east and west lead out to yard beyond."
