    "Remarkably dry compared to the surrounding mire, the planks are almost not needed in this small grassy clearing.  Though no trees or bushes occupy the space, tents and stalls have been set-up and arranged in such a fashion to resemble a squatter's town.  Clotheslines and cook fires are prevalent near every entry, yet despite the domestic appearance, some stalls have been turned towards the walkway and offer various wares for purchase.  Amid the clearing, a hefty dwarf stands within a field of bright orange pumpkins."
