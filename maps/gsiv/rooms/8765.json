    "A flower garden is planted in the center of this intersection -- white roses, blue tulips and brilliant yellow carnations ablaze in the sun.  On the eastern side of the street, the beginnings of a wooden bridge are flanked by tall, proud fel trees.  Beneath them, a finely garbed halfling snoozes in the sun, occasionally wriggling his toes with some dreamy pleasure.  He keeps a tight grip on his pipe, though.",
