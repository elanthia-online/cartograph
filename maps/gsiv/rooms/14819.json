    "Thousands of glasses, flutes and mugs hang inverted from a wooden rack that is nestled beneath the canopy.  Below them, the bar itself runs nearly the width of the square, its shiny laquered top mottled with shapes of light cast from colored lanterns lining the canopy's edge.  Occasional puffs of steam escape a large covered kettle set onto a hearth behind the counter, condensing in a film of sparkling droplets upon brass-handled taps which flank the brick."
