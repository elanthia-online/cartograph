    "A wide doorway paned with exquisite stained glass images of brilliantly feathered birds flying across a background of variegated greenery ushers visitors into the immense glaes dome that houses the aviaries.  Two Elanthia ironwood trees stand as sentinels to either side of the entrance, their bark providing a home for several varieties of delicate orchids.  More orchids are cultivated in the well-kept planters surrounding the trees.",
    "A wide doorway paned with exquisite stained glass images of brilliantly feathered birds flying across a background of variegated greenery is barred shut for the evening.  A string cordon around the door blocks entrance into the immense glaes dome that houses the aviaries.  Two Elanthia ironwood trees stand as sentinels to either side of the entrance, their bark providing a home for several varieties of delicate orchids.  More orchids are cultivated in the well-kept planters surrounding the trees."
