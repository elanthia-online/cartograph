  "description": [
    "This room is clearly utilitarian in design and usage.  Cluttered wooden tables line the walls, interspersed with bookshelves of various sizes and shapes.  Alchemical tools adorn some of the tables, while others hold flawed gems, or piles of parchment.  A large chandelier is suspended from the ceiling, lit with bright yellow flames that cast a bright light across the entire space."
