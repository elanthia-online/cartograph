    "Mullein torches cast flickering light above a table that is holding an assortment of very interesting items pertinent to the art of alchemy.  Piles of large, leather-bound tomes take up space in three of the four corners of this oddly shaped chamber.  Blocked by a rocking chair with an overstuffed pillow as a cushion, the wall bears a hole of considerable size.  From within the breach, greenish light waxes and wanes rhythmically."
