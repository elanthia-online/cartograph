  "description": [
    "A single bier stands here, upraised on a small dais.  The bier is wide, made of intricately carved white marble.  Resting upon the bier is the body of a woman, clad in a long white satin robe.  Her face is covered by a platinum mask, the features of which are kind and wise.  Her hands are gloved and her feet shod, giving you no view of her flesh.  A feeling of peace permeates the area as it has nowhere else in the temple, making you feel safe and cared for."
