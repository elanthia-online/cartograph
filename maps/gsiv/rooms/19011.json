    "Massive white marble pillars support a glass roof arching over this spacious circular meeting hall.  Moonlight streams liberally in through the glass to light the plush black velvet seats facing the raised crimson dais.  Narrow windows set in each of the walls have been closed to trap the heat and maintain an even temperature.  Sparkling silver carpet cascades down the aisles between the rows of seats, ending at the dais steps.  Sconces on each pillar are lit to brightly illuminate the hall."
