    "The sounds of rushing water from the spring to the west, the rustle of unseen forest creatures to the north, and an occasional plop, splash and sucking sound from the moat compete for your attention.  The spring's course bends here, disappearing into a thick clump of trees that signals the beginning of a great wood to the north.  Very faintly in the east, you can see pale outlines of peaks.  Dominating the southeast vista, the ruins of the Black Swan hover on the horizon."
