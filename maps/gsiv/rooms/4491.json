    "A rough rectangle of burlap has been spread under the partially empty weapon stand in the center of the room, its surface covered with bits of straw that have fallen from the unpacked weapons.  Sealed crates have been neatly stacked in one corner, while another stack of empty ones have been haphazardly piled in another.  A clerk occasionally wanders through, adding inventory to the rack and making checks in a small parchment notebook."
