    "The thick vegetation retreats as the path grows wider and the underbrush gives way to towering trees which block out patches of moonlight with an expansive canopy of green.  The calls of animals and birds fill the night air, interrupted by the occasional distant roar of a troll to the south.  As the path continues to the southeast, a trail of beaten dirt emerges from the closely shorn grass.",
