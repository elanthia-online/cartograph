  "description": [
    "Cream velvet curtains surround the bed in the center of the chamber, suspended from a wyvern-shaped pewter fixture high above.  The fabric is a shade off from the alabaster walls and floor, but the same color as the leather of the oversized chair and footstool placed in one corner.  At the foot of the bed is a wooden trunk, the match to a campaign table set up, with no regard for traffic, in front of the door.  A single alabaster arch is inset into one of the walls."
