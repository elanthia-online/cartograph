    "A sturdy wooden observation deck stretches out in a half-circle providing ample room for spectators.  A carved ironwood railing provides some leaning comfort to onlookers while they view the arena below.  The tops of flagpoles rise up from the sides of the deck and stretch up into the open sky above."
