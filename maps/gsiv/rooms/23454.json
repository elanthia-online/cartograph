    "The walls of this cramped cabin have been painted with floor to ceiling trees, and the wooden peg board on the wall opposite the hatch blends in with the brush-stroked bark of what seems to be a particularly large oak.  Overhead, a twilight sky speckled with white stars encloses the green tree boughs that reach up to the corners of the ceiling.  At the foot of one of the painted trees lies iron-bound chest, and nearby is steel box set atop a stump made of the remains of an old barrel."
