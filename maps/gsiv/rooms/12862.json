    "Smooth tile flooring stretches from one wall to the other of the small quaint shop, and the rich scent of baking wafts from a back room.  A variety of breads and other pastries fill the shelves and baskets set along the walls of the bakery.  A slender wooden counter stacked with parchment paper sits off to the side with a small, but noticeable sign."
