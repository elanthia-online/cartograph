  "description": [
    "The occasional fish darts through the slowly rippling water, the flash of silver scales as it moves a bright contrast to the deep blue of the lagoon.  Though the lack of trees ensures no shelter from the sun in the midst of the lagoon, the cool temperature of the water alleviates the heat to a tolerable level."
