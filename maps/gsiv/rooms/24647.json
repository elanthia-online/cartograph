  "description": [
    "Uncomfortably tight and barely able to support more than one traveler moving along, the narrow corridor is uncomfortably warm due to the close quarters and the number of flaming torches lighting the way.  Ruin walls have been worn almost completely smooth at the center, where hands and leather have rubbed against it, and small dirt piles litter the sides of the passageway."
