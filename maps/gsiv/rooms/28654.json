  "description": [
    "The heat radiating from a firepit in the middle of the vast hall scarcely reaches the grey stone walls, leaving them cold.  Carved into the frosted surface is an ethereal forest of leaf-bare trees creating the image of perpetual winter in familiar deciduous groves.  Pools of pale wax mar the tiled floor where tiered candles set in cast iron chandeliers overhead have been left to drip.  Oaken benches circle the blazing fire with the added comfort of thick furs draped over their high backs."
