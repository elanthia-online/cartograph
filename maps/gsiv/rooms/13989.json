    "Wooden stairs that must have once lead to the ramparts are now lying in ruins on the ground.  Almost intact, perhaps removed by decision rather than assault or catastrophe, the stairs present an odd puzzle.  Strewn about the room are numerous rotted canvas and leather slings filled with fist sized rocks."
