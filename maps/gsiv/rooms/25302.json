    "Daisy-patterned curtains decorate the oak-framed windows that are positioned to either side of the shop's entry, the gossamer fabric loose and unfettered.  Bright white daisies are painted upon the cobalt blue stucco walls, the center of each housing glass globes filled with candles.  A long whitewashed counter encircles three of the shop's four walls and has comfortable stools set in front of it at even intervals."
