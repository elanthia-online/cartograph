    "[Silver Wing Table]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "A rubbing of silvered oil is buffed into the grain of the table, giving the ebonwood a touch of glimmer in this intimately lit setting.  Each chairback features a small pair of angel's wings carved to form a headrest glazed with the same metallic hue.  Hanging on the wall just above the round table is a brass-framed oil painting illuminated by a nearby iron lantern."
