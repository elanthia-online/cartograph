    "A forgotten cart loaded with leather-bound tomes and neatly rolled scrolls is parked between two openings in the expansive stone wall of the tower.  Glowing light emanating from within crystal-filled chambers floods the area with color, the beams drawn to the east, focused on a bulky metal contraption.  A humming noise echoes throughout the cavernous darkness above."
