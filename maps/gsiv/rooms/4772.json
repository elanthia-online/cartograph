    "A wide overgrown trail cuts through a stand of yellow birches, their slender trunks ensnared by the dull green tendrils of the surrounding undergrowth.  Burrs and sharp-skinned briars tear at clothing and unprotected flesh, as if attempting to draw unwary travelers into their torturous embrace.  Toward the south, the forest appears to open into a wide clearing, the pale blue of the sky just visible amongst the intergrown branches of the nearby trees.",
