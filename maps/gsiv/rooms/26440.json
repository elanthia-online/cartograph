    "Aqueous rivulets of dark indigo sand seep down through tiny fractures in the rocky face of the high cliffs, as though the mountain is crying thick, purple-tinted tears.  Each oozing ribbon of silt joins with the others where the slippery path levels out, forming a wet mire of boot-sucking sludge.  Choosing a safe foothold in the enveloping darkness becomes a trecherous task not suited to the faint-hearted.",
