    "Further back from the bluff, the trail becomes more a carpet of needles than snow.  Cabins built here are deeply shadowed by the expansive pine boughs, set in a perennial half-light with a distinctive green cast.  Candles twinkle in their windows, looking more like will o' the wisps than substantial light in the snowy gusts of wind."
