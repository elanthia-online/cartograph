    "The valley dips here providing even sharper contrast between the living green of the valley and the brown desolation of the surrounding hills and the gloomy Thanatoph.  Having retreated to more hospitable clime, the fel trees that dominated the northwestern ridgeline are nowhere to be seen.  A slightly foul undertone invades the fresh green smells of life around you."
