    "The path climbs a small hummock, completely surrounded by tall cattails, bullrushes and thick reeds.  A ridge can be seen thrusting up along the north side of the marsh, leading to a spare and desolate moor.  A large boulder is visible to the east.  The path to the southwest disappears among the reeds."
