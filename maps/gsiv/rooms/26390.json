    "The raised pine walkway, supported by sturdy pilings buried in the waist-deep muck, traverses an east-west path through the swamp.  A respite from the overhead tangle allows some silvery-grey beams of moonlight to illuminate the otherwise dark, wooden walkway.  The still of the night is broken by the deep, persistent growling of some large cat."
