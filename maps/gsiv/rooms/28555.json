  "description": [
    "The rising some shallow steps level into a tiled floor sheltered beneath a velarium of heavy onyx-hued fabric on a latticed metal frame.  Situated in the center of the atrium is a massive stone throne, its facade weathered yet still impressive with its sheer size and elaborate carvings.  Squat wrought-iron braziers sit on each side, their red-violet embers caged behind an iron shield pierced by cutouts that throw unnatural light across the fabric overhead, each shape a yawning maw exhaling ghosts of crimson flame."
