    "Thin and wide, the corridor is a straight line that leads from a set of upward spiraling stairs to a set of downward ones.  Carved into the eastern wall is a mural of an enormous forge that is illuminated by crimson toadstools set before it, while the western wall houses a large niche.  Candles litter the floor beneath the alcove, many of which show eminent signs of expiring."
