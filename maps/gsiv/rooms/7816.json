    "Great blocks of stone thrust out of the earth all about you as you pick your way across the jagged landscape.  Here and there, a patch of crinkly lichen clings to the pale gray stone, but other than that, this area is devoid of plant life.  You hear a faint skittering in the distance, and think of claws on rock.  You glance around nervously, wondering what lives here."
