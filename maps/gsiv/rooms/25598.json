    "The confined backstage area for the Jastev Amphitheater is fitted with the usual jungle-like tangle of ropes, pulleys and flats.  It offers access to the green room and a dressing room, as well as passage back to the Guild Hall via a covered walkway.  The ceiling is high overhead, cloaked with catwalks, scrims and drops, and other miscellany.  A collection of heavy ropes is controlled with a wooden frame mounted on the front wall, allowing the stage curtains to be easily opened and closed."
