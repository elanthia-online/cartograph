    "The delicate sound of dozens of crystal teardrops bumping against each other draws your attention to the center of this room.  There, suspended from the high ceiling, is a brass chandelier with seven ornate fittings for candles amid the lacework of cut glass.  A large dining table and chairs appear untouched by fire, their once gleaming surfaces now dry and covered with dust after years of neglect."
