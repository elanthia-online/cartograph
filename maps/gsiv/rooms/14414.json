    "An openwork iron staircase rises up in a sharp spiral, ascending the levels of this small turret.  The walls have been painted a pale hue that contains a mottled shading of cream with touches of silver, more like moonlight shining on a field of snow than the flames of a white-hot inferno.  An arched doorway leads out to the garden."
