    "Arrow slots are the only windows in the spartan room, decorated only with a simple cot, table, and a large wood chest.  Several tanned krolvin skins are stretched and hung on the walls, providing the backdrop for a weapons rack and a modwir plaque.  The superintendent, a striking and scarred giantwoman, stands in the center of the room directing her attention from visitors to the men and women training in the courtyard."
