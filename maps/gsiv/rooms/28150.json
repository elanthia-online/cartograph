    "Blown glass lanterns decorate the face of the off-white stone structure that has been built within the dark confines of a juniper grove.  Rainbow-whorled windows reflect the light from within, though the thick fog of steam that limns the panes makes it impossible to see the interior.  Slipping through the foliage, a winding path provides egress."
