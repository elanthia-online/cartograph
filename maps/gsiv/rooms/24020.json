    "Tucked in the shadow of the coliseum, a strange booth dominates this area.  Puffs of steam and strange noises randomly erupt from the booth as tiny tin targets rise above the front panel of the stall and travel in a jumpy motion across the plank ledge to disappear once more behind the facing boards.  A well-balanced vultite dagger rests on a small stump near the odd contraption.  A tiny gnome occasionally peeks from behind the booth."
