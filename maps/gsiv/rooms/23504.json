    "Two iron lanterns hang on both sides of the dart board, offering poor lighting for the entire room, but illuminating the dart board perfectly.  Pushed up against the back wall, a polished wooden rack stands, its surface etched with a dart in flight.  From just beyond the doorway, the smell of cigar smoke and ale wafts into the room."
