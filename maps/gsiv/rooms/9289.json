    "Scented smoke drifts upwards from a low brass lamp, curling toward the ceiling before dissipating.  The table top is etched with letters in several different styles, from roughly hewn initials to lightly flowing elven lettering.  Carved into the table is the phrase: \"R. Thrak is a big fat....\"  The scrawl ends in a dark brown stain resembling a thrak shaped like a question mark."
