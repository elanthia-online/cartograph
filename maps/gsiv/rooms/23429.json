    "The musty air reeks from the yeasty stench of old beer mingled with snuffed out tobacco in this small space.  Some overturned shipping crates surround a small chalk-drawn circle, and a few scraps of paper litter the floor.  A splintered wooden shelf is mounted above a rotted wood plank on one wall, and a rickety display case is situated along the opposite wall.  A thick steel ring is nestled in the corner on the floor near the exit hatch, over which a large notice is posted."
