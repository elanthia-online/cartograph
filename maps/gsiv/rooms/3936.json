    "Thick moss covers every available surface here.  Where you can see through the growth, you notice that the walls seem fairly recent and are made of red brick.  Openings in the ceiling at seemingly random intervals provide some faint light and occasionally you hear footsteps and murmurings overhead.  The tunnel continues on to the north, up along a high ledge."
