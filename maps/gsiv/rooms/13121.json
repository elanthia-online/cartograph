    "Three of the dining hall's four tables are covered with benches and chairs that have been put up for the night, though several remain available around a lone table left in place for late night dinners.  The soft sound of bakers working in the kitchen to the north drifts towards this end of the room, while torchlight from the corridor beyond the open door creates a pool of illumination on the polished floorboards.",
