    "The river passes by sluggishly, meandering shallowly among the boulders, logs and other debris strewn across the riverbed.  The main volume of water seems to be somewhere else.  If not for the difficulty of clambering over the blockages, and the possibility that a deep, treacherous section hides among the rubble, one could consider walking across the river at this point.  Easier, though, would be to use the sturdy bridge that spans the river just to the south."
