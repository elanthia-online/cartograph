    "Parti-colored pennants flutter from carved aspen posts sunk in the soft ground, a tattered sailcloth overhead sheltering smoldering coals in a rock-lined fire pit.  Laid out on a stump-mounted anvil, a hammer and tongs await a smithy's arrival, leather bellows and water-filled buckets close-at-hand.  The distinctive smell of singed hair and burnt flesh lingers in the stall."
