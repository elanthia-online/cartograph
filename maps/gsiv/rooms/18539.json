    "The end of the dirt pathway disappears beneath a blanket of grass growing within an opening in the fence, which allows passage to the field on the other side.  A large basket brimming with pulled weeds rests near the break in the fence, and a checkered handkerchief has been hung on one of the rails as if to dry.  Near the field's center, the peaks of tents can be seen."
