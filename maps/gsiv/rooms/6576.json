  "description": [
    "The cylindrical keep looks as if it's much older than the other parts of the castle, which follows a more modern, rectangular design.  The keep's ground floor stands two-stories tall.  Its old 'murder-holes' -- through which rocks or scalding oil were once thrown down on unwelcome guests -- are now filled in.  Halls lead off to the east and to the south, and a handsomely carved, arched door leads outside."
