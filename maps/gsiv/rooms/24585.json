    "Cut glass shades guard the tiny flames of the candles atop the lanterns along the walls, and this area of the wagon is filled with a warm amber light.  Off against the far wall sits a wardrobe filled to brimming with gowns, and to the side of it is a set of wrought iron hooks on the wall.  Opposite the wardrobe is a small set of shallow risers, which display a variety of footwear, and nearby is a circular table draped in velvet."
