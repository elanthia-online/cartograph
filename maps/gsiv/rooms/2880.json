    "Mist fills the forest, cloaking the area in a haze.  Trees appear as phantom forms stepping from the shadows.  Nearby, a small stream bubbles and churns as it spills down the rolling incline.  Along its banks, patches of juniper sprout from the thin layer of snow, their needled stems woven into thick mats of green."
