    "With all loose brush pushed to the side, the small clearing is host to a tall metal stake that protrudes from the ground.  The stake itself is blackened, and the ground around it is charred a dark black color, where the grains of dirt have melted together in places.  Encircling this configuration is a ring of bright white sand.  Off to one side, a hut with red-painted walls is just barely visible."
