    "Crusts of luminescent lichen cling to the walls.  Their frail green light barely reaches the floor, leaving heavy shadows that obscure the corners of the low, rough-hewn cavern.  A taciturn dwarf garbed in battle leathers stands beside a weapon rack.  His head is even with the middle ledge in a set of three ledges carved from the rock wall.  Except for the occasional shift of his gaze, he stands as still as a statue in the gloom."
