    "The bulkheads of the cabin are polished rosewood, and a beautiful floral rug carpets the deck.  The feminine ambiance of the cabin is startling in comparison to the rest of the ship's seafaring decor.  Hanging on the bulkheads are paintings, showing ladies of style and leisure shopping to their heart's content -- all short of stature, of course.  Near the back of the room is a door to a cedar closet and another door to a walk-in closet, both propped open to allow easy access to their interiors."
