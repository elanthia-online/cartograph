  "description": [
    "Tall cattails and bullrushes line the spongy pathway, drastically limiting the line of sight.  The fog, smelling faintly of sulphur, hovers overhead.  The hum and whine of gnats and mosquitoes is muted by the damp, chill fog.  The odor of decomposing vegetation and swamp gas competes with the sulphurous fog."
