    "Tie pilings, bound to the main body of the pier by large U-shaped brackets, line the western and eastern edges of the platform where cork bumpers protect the wood from incoming vessels.  Support posts tower over the pilings, their tops fitted with smooth platforms where local ospreys have built their haphazard nests, while a small white sign that reads \"Pier 1 - Slips 11-15\" is tacked to an oak barrel in the center of the walking space."
