    "A fused sun and moon wall-hanging hangs on one of the refined oak-paneled walls, and a domed white stucco ceiling rises overhead.  A worn rug sits in one corner of a white limestone floor.  There is a heavy lead glass display case on one side of the shop and a vine-carved mahogany table on the other."
