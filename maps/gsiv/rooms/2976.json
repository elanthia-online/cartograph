    "A grate of sturdy iron guards an alcove carved into the pitted stone wall.  Inside the niche, a faded silk sash of ivory and crimson rests upon a cube of flawless white opal.  The thick iron bars are battered and bent, as if someone or something had tried unsuccessfully to relocate the treasures within."
