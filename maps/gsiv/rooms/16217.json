  "description": [
    "Tavern Way passes the front of Pond Burrow's mead hall.  Cheerful pools of light fall from its shuttered windows, glowing on the walk.  Its entrance can be seen a little further north.  As the paved walk rounds the southern corner of the building, it narrows into a gullet-like tunnel notable for the row of lanterns hung down its length, all carved in the shape of flying bees.  They appear to head purposefully down the corridor in search of nectar."
