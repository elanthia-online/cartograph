    "Dozens of orchids hang from a cluster of beech trees, the dangling blooms cascading downward in a sweeping curtain of color.  Bees and butterflies by the score visit the blossoms, gathering pollen to continue the cycle of life.  The beeches that offer the flowers a home themselves stand sturdy and strong, their massive trunks buttressed firmly against the earth as if to mark their own sure position in the natural order of the rainforest."
