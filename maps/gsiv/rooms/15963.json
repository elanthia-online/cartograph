    "What little trail remains ends at the foot of a tall bluff.  Overhead, the ridge is heavily forested in pines, their trunks looking very tall and stately with fore-shortening.  A stair has been carved into the granite of the bluff.  The course winds up the sheer face, breaking up the altitude with its lazy zigzag.  Just at the foot of the steps, a ring of boulders marks where campfires have burned."
