  "description": [
    "Rivulets of icy-cold water dribble down the angled rocks walls to form shallow, standing pools along the sides of the tunnel.  An abundance of hornwort carpets the damp space, its elongated, horn-like sporophytes reaching upwards as though trying to escape.  Wafts of fresh air deliver the occasional fragrance of the nearby woodlands and the faint scent of sea air."
