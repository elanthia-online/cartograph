  "description": [
    "A tapestry covers the wooden wall of the tree at the landing, its breadth easily as wide as a barn.  As the walkway curves to the west, the spiraling incline passes beneath the arch of a graceful, hanging stair.  The construction floats in the haze as though it has no support, suspended as it is on silver threads as fine as sewing silk.  It stretches from the head of the incline higher above, connecting that with a platform attached to the top of the hollow bole."
