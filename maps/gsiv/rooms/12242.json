    "A landscape of socks unfolds in peaks and valleys, as well as far-stretching planes of multihued footwear.  In the immediate area are socks of wool and cotton, plain and with designs, such as midget pickles and plump sausages.  Some even have holes and are unraveling.  A few socks have been crumpled into balls, frozen into globes of ice and fabric, and are piled into a pyramid shape.",
    "Peaks rise into the sky, and valleys fall low between, while the foreground stretches out in a sea of mismatched socks.  The mounds in the distance are made of the same, and occasionally, a spark will flare from the sky, setting a sock aflame.  It will burn away, and others tumble to the valley in its wake.  There are woolen socks and cotton socks, some with designs and some without.  Some have holes, while others have been carefully darned.  But, nowhere in sight are two that match."
