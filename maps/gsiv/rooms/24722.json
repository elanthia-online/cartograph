    "Scattered bloodstained stones and flattened bones twist in a ghoulish mosaic along the ground, stretching out in a wide circle around a tall scorched tree.  The charred branches of the old oak spread out like shadowy latticework, the wooden limbs resembling sharp, gnarled fingers.  A few patches of brown grass jut out from some cracks within the grisly cobblestone ground, their slender tips speckled with dried blood."
