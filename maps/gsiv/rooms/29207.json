  "description": [
    "The sides and low-hanging dome in this narrow tunnel seem to have undergone tectonic changes.  Patterns within the limestone stop and start as though each face was, at some point, wrenched away from its neighbor.  The light from the entrance to the south dims here.  Fortunately, someone had the forethought to leave a pile of resin-coated torches nearby.  A smoky grey helictite nearly blocks the narrow corridor, its helix shape arising from the twisting and curling of the calcium carbonate structure."
