    "Resting upon the northern edge of the cobblestone street, the dainty little cottage has enormous windows and a slanted roof of terra cotta tiles.  Lanterns dangling from their perches on wrought iron posts reflect the sunlight in prismatic sprays across the lawns surrounding the dwelling, while a small fence encircling the property attempts to confine the dozens of lush, exotic flowers and has an elegant white sign bolted to its pickets.",
