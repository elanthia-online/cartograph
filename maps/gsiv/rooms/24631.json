    "Dangling on gilded chains, lit crystal globes cast a spray of light across the area creating a glittering rainbow effect.  Flowing in from the main area of the pavilion, the velvet carpeting softens each step and the silken walls mute the noise outside.  A large gold-framed mirror stands against the back drape while to either side of it, a pair of elegant mannequins house various wares."
