    "Jagged, dark peaks hem in the eastern edge of Gossamer Valley.  The dark rock absorbs the sunlight during the day, so even at night small, gurgling melt streams slide down the rock from the collected snow high above. The streams run down to the icy floor below and spread out to quickly freeze into ice deltas.  Near the stream, small holes in the mountainside with accumulated debris just outside indicate the presence of burrowing animals.",
