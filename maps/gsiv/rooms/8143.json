    "The large boulders jumbled about are mottled with delicate mosses.  Trillium grows here and there, offering tri-leafed stems crowned with snow-white blossoms.  Ferns resume their rampant play behind the edge of the granite outcrop, sprawling over and around the feet of a beautifully veined, black marble portal."
