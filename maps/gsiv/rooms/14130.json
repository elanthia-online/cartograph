    "Framed by seamless walls of gold-veined white marble, the antechamber is well-appointed but modest.  Sunlight filters in from a mullioned glass window in the northern wall, forming golden puddles on a woven spidersilk rug.  An oaken coatrack stands beside a white illthorn door leading out to the temple.",
