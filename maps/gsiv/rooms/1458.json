    "A knot of merchants in their fur-trimmed doublets and cloaks stand in the middle of the intersection, engaged in an animated debate and oblivious to the glares of those who have to go around them.  The blue-grey of Vornavis' west wall forms a backdrop for the buildings to the east.  Filling the northeast corner of the intersection stands what appears to be a townhouse, but the dark grey brickwork and mortar the color of dried blood gives the building an ominous air."
