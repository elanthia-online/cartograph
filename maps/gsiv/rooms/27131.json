    "Trimmed to the shape of a peacock, a pair of thick boxwoods flanks a pair of polished oak gates.  Thick vines of blooming white roses climb up the beautifully polished wood of the entrance and curl around a wooden sign.  Each letter and image has been expertly carved into the curved top of the meadow's double entry.  A flower-strewn path leads back to Sylvarraend Road."
