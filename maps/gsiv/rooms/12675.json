    "Porous coral has grown between the fallen pilasters that block the vaulted archway leading into the atrium to the immediate north.  Buried under a pair of fallen statues is a large, tarnished gong and punctured metal brazier.  The colonnade sweeps out to both sides, leading further into the temple."
