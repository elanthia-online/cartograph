    "A quiet hush attends the small living area; somehow appropriate against the stark black velvet drapery that covers the walls of this cell with the oppressive weight of fanaticism, or devotion.  Only a single covering giving all the warmth of breezy silk wards a small cot in the corner.  A hook juts expectantly from the wall, as if waiting to grasp the throat of a victim in the spider's way of tender torture."
