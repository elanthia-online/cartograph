    "Large sections of the fence have collapsed, the wood rotted and broken.  Five small houses have been built on plots of land next to one another, turned toward the south.  Each looks like the rest with a small fence, a cobblestone walk leading from road to porch, and a small flower garden placed in the right side of the yard."
