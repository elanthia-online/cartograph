  "description": [
    "Creeping vines hang low, their lengths decorated by vividly hued orchid blossoms.  Coiled around a low-lying branch, poison green snakes lie motionless, their coloring providing nearly perfect camouflage until they slither away.  High overhead, two-toed sloths slowly but frequently make their way along a woody liana vine.  Infrequent breezes limp through the excessively humid air, the short-lived moments of relief from the oppressive heat a welcome torture."
