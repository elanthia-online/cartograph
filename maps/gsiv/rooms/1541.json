    "Midway between Solhaven's shoreline and Niima's temple to the west, the solidity of the balustraded causeway gives small reassurance when flanked on either hand by Charl's realm.  The worn stones of the walk and the polished rails speak of the reverence and devotion harbored by devotees of The Daughter of the Sea, and of the countless numbers who have trod this path before."
