  "description": [
    "Nuts enclosed in prickly burs surround the bole of a large beech tree.  Some of the burs are split open revealing their moldy insides.  A piece of rotting wood with a medium-sized boulder holding down one corner lies near the tree.  Irregularly shaped, the board does little to cover a huge gaping hole in the ground.  The mewling sounds of small animals emanate from within the opening.  Dangling from one of the branches of the tree, a translucent skin turned inside out blows on a breeze."
