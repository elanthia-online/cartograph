  "description": [
    "Just above, the canopy of the forest opens to a thick mist that hides any glimpse of the island from view.  A few colorful butterflies brave the damp air, flying about the twisted vines.  Clear of decay, the air is fresh and cooler than that at ground level.  A slight breeze moves through the treetop canopy like a gentle caress.  Surrounded with a sense of solitude, the limbs make a perfect place to sit in contemplation."
