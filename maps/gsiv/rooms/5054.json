    "Inside the tower, the floor is still sturdy and strong.  The walls have cracked and crumbled, but still stand nearly two stories high in some places.  To the west, a large doorway leads outward to a cobblestone road.  The width of the ring of remains indicates that the tower was once very tall, possibly a watchtower capable of viewing the countryside for miles around."
