    "The hall is long and wide and filled with golden sconces and torch lights.  The floor is paved with stones of many hues and engraved with branching runes and strange devices.  The pillars are richly carved, gleaming dully with mithril and gold.  Many woven tapestries hang upon the walls, and over their wide expanses march figures of ancient legend.  Upon one, where the light illuminates the brightest, a young man upon a white horse is blowing a great horn, his yellow hair flying in the wind."
