    "Lacquered bamboo poles provide structural support for the various layers of violet and grey silk that create the walls and ceiling of the domed pavilion.  Tiny copper lanterns provide soft illumination for the area and illuminate the silvery whorls that decorate the cedar panels of the floor.  Sitting alone in the center of the room, a small display case offers a view of the wares for sale."
