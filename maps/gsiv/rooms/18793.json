    "A glaesine-topped mistwood workbench dominates the cramped laboratory, one end pushed against the wall so it is beneath an oval window.  Atop the window-side of the workbench rests a complicated, copper gem lens assembly.  A  glass alembic and an herb-carved, green marble crucible also congregate upon the workbench.  Scorch marks mar the white marble floors, and a curtained arch leads northeast to the main hallway.  Shadowed by darkness, a potted wolfsbane plant sits in the lone, unscorched corner.",
