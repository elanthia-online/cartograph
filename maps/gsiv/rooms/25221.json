  "description": [
    "Sand pools in the corners of the tower's ground floor.  It seeps in through chinks in the ill-made walls of stone, but the real flood of it pours in through the wide open doorway, accompanied by searing wind and stinging sunlight.  Although the stairway ascending to the second story is wrought from blocks of solid stone, it manages to look exceedingly treacherous and unstable."
