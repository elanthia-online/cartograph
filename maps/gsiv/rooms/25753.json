    "A massive stone hearth dominates the kitchen, its glowing embers radiating warmth along the floor.  The high ceiling has been fitted with cerulean rafters, while open windows let in the slightly salty sea air.  Laid out upon a sea glass-inlaid countertop are several trays of food and beverages.  Alternating blue and white tiles have been inlaid into a square teakwood table, which has been surrounded by four matching chairs."
