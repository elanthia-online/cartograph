    "The temperature inside the cramped wagon is hot enough to make the knotty pine walls sweat.  A faint scent of mildew clings to a pair of run-down seats that are pushed against the wagon walls.  Scattered across the deteriorating floor is a mess of defective crates, which creates a hazard to anyone trying to traverse this tiny space."
