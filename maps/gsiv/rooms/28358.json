    "Hundreds of potions, powders, and other arcane ingredients rest on maoral shelves placed haphazardly around the large room, which is faintly illuminated by several tall candles.  A clawfoot thanot table topped with a scorched glaes slab dominates the center of the room, with several matching chairs scattered near it.  Against the rear wall, an iron cauldron sits near some metal and glass display cases holding various vials and oddly shaped containers, as well as a few less recognizable items."
