    "An intricately made brass and jade cauldron rests in the far corner of this room, emitting a blazing fire which, oddly, seems to give off no heat or smoke.  Directly in the center of the floor stands a masterfully carved black willow desk bearing three neatly stacked piles of papers, each held down with huge pieces of pale blue moonstone shaped into five-pointed stars.  On the back wall, a tapestry made from silk damask depicts scenes of nature."
