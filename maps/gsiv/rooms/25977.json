  "description": [
    "Stone walls encapsulate this large room, and benches of the same material seem to reach up from the floor to beckon weary visitors to rest.  Steam rises from the circular stone pit in the center of the room, created from water poured over the blazing hot rocks inside.  Hooks and shelves on the wall near the engraved wooden door serve to hold the clothing and belongings of bathers, and floral scented oil lanterns hang high above the floor, bathing the room in a flickering glow."
