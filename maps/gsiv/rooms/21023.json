    "Free from the constant cleansing thrust of a tidal current, the water of the pond abounds with a wide variety of aquatic life.  Golden and jungle perch share the liquid environment with short-finned eels, and freshwater algae produce colorful surface patches.  Deep croaks and high-pitched ribbits resound from beneath the shade of fruit-laden lilly-pilly trees.  The pond serves as a favored spot for the larger wildlife of the surrounding jungle to pause for a quiet drink."
