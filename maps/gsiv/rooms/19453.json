    "A midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the painted black oak walls, and a low skylight-set ceiling rises overhead.  An iron candelabra sits in one corner of a polished oak floor.  There is a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on one side of the shop and a low wrought iron table on the other."
