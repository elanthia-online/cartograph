  "description": [
    "Tucked back behind the bulk of the building, a small oasis of blooming green stands out against the white marble walls that surround it.  Neatly tended gardenia, grown in a circular hedge in the middle of the garden, makes a hollow for a swathe of stargazer lilies.  Secondary beds, laid out symmetrically around the center planting, feature jack-in-the-pulpit and snapdragons, as well as columbine."
