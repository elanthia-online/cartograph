    "Sunlight slants across the room and illuminates several bottles of dye that are on display in this room.  The light reflects off of the bottles, creating a colorful prismatic spray across the oak floorboards and walls.  Several shelves are neatly hung upon the walls near a sturdy whitewashed door, while a low table and bench rest beneath the bay window set into the southern wall.",
