  "description": [
    "Two elegant crystal chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceiling, while a set of deep bay windows, complete with thickly cushioned seats, flank an immense fireleaf door.  Moonlight streaming through the windows illuminates the polished blonde oak floor and a broad silk tapestry that covers much of the eastern wall.  A bas-relief panel, depicting a garden scene, graces the western end of the northern enclosure of the room."
