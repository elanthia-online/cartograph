    "A narrow inlet of water trickles into a circular pond that lays eerily still, a watery vortex spinning in its center.  Glowing veins of assorted minerals, rich with ore deposits, line the walls from floor to ceiling.  Pooling on the floor of the cavern is a thick white mist that obscures the surroundings."
