    "Skeletons, partial and full, have been stacked high against the walls like cords of firewood.  Silken strands of webbing hold them against the grey stone, shimmering with a light coating of ice.  Several bones have escaped the spiders' nets to fall to the dusty floor, cluttering the path like the discarded toys of a macabre child."
