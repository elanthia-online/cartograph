  "description": [
    "Noting the steep slope to the inner ward, the broad dirt stretch to the outer wall, and the ramparts with battlements on both sides, it seems that the outer ward is a well-designed trap.  Attackers caught between defenders on both walls with no cover and uncertain footing would find themselves in nothing but a killing field."
