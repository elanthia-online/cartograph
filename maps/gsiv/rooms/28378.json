    "Onyx and white marble tiles form the floor, nestled together snugly in patterns that are too orderly to be random, yet too chaotic to be planned, like pieces of a shattered puzzle.  The deep crimson brocade covering the walls is home to narrow ebonwood shelves, each holding a perfect rose in a slender vaalin vase.  Thirteen snowy white blooms face an equal number of midnight black roses on the south wall.  A white marble sculpture sits on the floor beneath the centermost black rose."
