    "A sapphire-studded chandelier of carved pinewood blazes with dozens of candles, casting brilliant light down onto the parquet floor.  The flooring depicts a charging mule in interlocking lengths of pine, spruce, and cedarwood, each stained to maximize its color and gloss.  Banquet tables all around are prepared with settings of real silver and white porcelain."
