    "Great arching branches come together in the center of the tree, forming a huge cathedral-like hall.  The walls stretching upwards from the landing are a deep, black hue so dark they appear liquid.  Great branch-like structures form a majestic colonnade down the periphery of the huge chamber.  The smooth, expansive floor is broken abruptly in the center of the room by the passage leading down."
