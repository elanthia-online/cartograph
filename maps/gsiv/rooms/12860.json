    "Old wooden floorboards spread throughout the bar, and a long wooden bartop sits off the side near the entryway.  Several stools line the bar, some of their cushions torn from years of use.  A faded sign hangs behind the bar underneath a large bronze boar's head, listing the establishment's drinks."
