    "A pair of green-tinged shrubberies stand beside a dark opening in the sheer cliff face in the face of a sheer cliff, almost like squat, silent guards.  High stone walls rise up on either side of the pass, limiting the view to a rectangular patch of star-dotted sky, its bespeckled surface masked by thin, tattered clouds.  The narrow cleft through the mountain continues northward.",

High stone walls rise up on either side of the pass, limiting the view to a rectangular patch of grey sky, its serene surface masked with thin, tattered clouds.
