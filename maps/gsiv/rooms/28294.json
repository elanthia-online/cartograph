    "Several blue leather club chairs are grouped around the room with small tables placed nearby.  A framed mirror hangs on the wall opposite a polished maoral door.  The floor is covered with a royal blue textured rug, and bookcases reach half way up the walls.  A light blue enamelled stove stands in the corner."
