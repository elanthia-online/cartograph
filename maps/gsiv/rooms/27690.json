    "Mellow yellow walls encapsulate this small room, and a lit fireplace in the corner casts a golden glow on the surroundings.  Soft dark gold carpeting muffles the room, further enhancing the cozy atmosphere.  In the center of the room, a sign on a black metal stand sits beside several chairs painted the same yellow as the walls, while two young erithian attendants mill nearby.  Set in the western wall an ovular black metal doorway leads back to the lobby, and a black-framed ovular mirror hangs adjacent."
