    "The wing splits into two grandiose corridors lined with suits of burnished armor and a collection of stone statues.  At the intersection, a carved marble pedestal with a faceless bust resting atop its surface is illuminated by a pair of ostentatious, gilded sconces.  Positioned on either side of the pedestal are marble benches with carved indentations."
