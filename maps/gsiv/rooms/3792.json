  "description": [
    "The ledge narrows further here, forcing you to cling close to the wall to continue on your way.  Shimmying along the ledge, you notice an alcove filled with numerous chalk drawings.  As the air thins further, breathing becomes laborious, and you almost upset your balance with heavy inhalations."
