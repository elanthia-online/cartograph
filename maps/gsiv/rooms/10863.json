    "Against the backdrop of a forest to the south, this garden is open to a starlit sky.  In unruly disorder, flowers and herbs of all descriptions are scattered in several beds throughout the gardens.  To the north, a large meadow spreads out as far as you can see.  Off to one side, a wizened old elf is busily uprooting weeds from one particularly overgrown bed.  Whistling a merry tune, he occasionally breaks into a sweet song as he works, smiling at all who enter his domain.",
