    "The ground is somewhat solid here, though covered with a layer of slippery muck that threatens your footing at every step.  A few ancient graves marked by corroded monuments are set along the path, their occupants untouched as yet by the ravages of the swamp.  A foul miasma of vapors and rot emanates from the mire to the west."
