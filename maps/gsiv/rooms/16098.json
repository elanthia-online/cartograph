    "Building supplies are scattered about the room.  A table is covered with tiles and tesserae of many shapes and colors.  Massive beams of oak and thanot clutter the floor.  Burlap bags of plaster mix are set beneath a table holding a variety of pigments.  The smell of plaster dust is stifling."
