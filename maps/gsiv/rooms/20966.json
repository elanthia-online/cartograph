    "Stuck in the side of one of the trees at the river's edge is a short, stubby arrow adorned with grungy green parrot feathers.  It is difficult to tell how long the arrow has been lodged in the tree, especially when the dampness and constant droplets of water cause the dead wood to decay quicker than normal.  A few large stones serve as a pathway to the river's edge."
