    "The shards of large earthenware vessels, some still containing the husks of old cloves of garlic, are lined against a collapsed, vine-enshrouded wall.  Two small bones dangle from a wooden peg set into a niche in the wall.  The niche is encircled with two wavy lines of some foul smelling, maroon-colored paste.  The jungle foliage encroaches on the ruins."
