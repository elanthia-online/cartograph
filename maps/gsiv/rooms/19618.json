    "Darkly paneled walls are adorned with silver dice and gold playing cards, while alabaster floors are visible beneath runners of plush, royal blue carpeting.  A cherrywood bar runs the length of the room, amply stocked with shelves of various alcoholic beverages and accouterments.  An open arch to the southwest leads to the prow of the riverboat, and a wrought iron spiral staircase climbs up to the next level."
