    "Dusky golden sunlight pours in from an arched glass window that forms nearly the entire back wall of the divided alcove.  Blossoming wildflowers and feathered greenery are softly strewn through the entire space, a few of the wayward blooms gathered in small offerings around a slender blue quartz reliquary.  Grown over with intensely verdant mosses, an ivory sculpture of Imaera and Jaston sits at the center of the room, the opaque planes of their eyes perpetually gazing up towards the sky."
