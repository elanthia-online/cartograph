  "description": [
    "The air practically reeks of weapon oil, and every surface gleams with it -- not, judging from the state of the weaponry, that it was applied in time to do much good, but apparently Rustaye has a philosophical approach to things, or else perhaps he believes that any amount of damage can be concealed with sufficient grease.  An orange-tinged hatch on the east wall allows egress."
