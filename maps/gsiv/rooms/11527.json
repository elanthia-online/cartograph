    "Knee-deep water covers the sandy path as it winds between coral outcroppings.  A musical dripping sound echoes through the passage as condensation falls from the walls of the passage into the water below.  To the east the passageway, wrapped in darkness, has clearly been formed by hands rather than by nature."
