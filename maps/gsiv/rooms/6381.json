    "At one time a trail probably wound around this cliff face both to the north and south.  It now appears that an avalanche has destroyed the southern part of the trail.  However, in addition to the north bound trail, a high ledge offers some promise of passage.  The cliff face seems to have been weathered and worn almost into a natural stair leading up to the high ledge.  It should be fairly easy to get up there."
