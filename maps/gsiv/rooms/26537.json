  "description": [
    "Thin, jagged shards of broken rock mark the only egress here, with a steep slope nearly connecting the high plateau above with the encircling pathway below.  The melodic sounds of a distant lute drift downward from a covered portico above, but are nearly drowned out by the crashing of waves upon rock from the eastern exposure.  The nocturnal fauna lend an eerie accompaniment to the distant melody with croaking, chirping, and hissing.",

Sounds of clinking glassware and muted conversations drift downward from a covered portico above, but are nearly drowned out by the crashing of waves upon rock and the incessant squawking of seabirds on the wing from the eastern exposure."
