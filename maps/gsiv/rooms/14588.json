    "The hovel, sewn from the skins of countless felines, reeks of decaying meat and the acrid smell of blood.  There are no windows; a torn leather flap provides the only way in or out.  A small cooking fire centered in the room provides a dim illumination, and a dried mat of what appears to be krolvin skin is stretched out on a rack very close to the ground.  A large variety of bone and skull fragments are strewn haphazardly around the rack."
