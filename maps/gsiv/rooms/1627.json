    "From this overlook you can see all the way across the valley below, where darker lines of vegetation trace the paths of streams and the meadows are scraps of pale yellow-green.  Tiny acorn caps pepper the trail, material evidence of the scrub oaks which emerge improbably from a narrow shelf high above your head."
