    "Flickering candlelight from the wall sconces lining the room plays along the colorful collection of jars and bottles on the shelves that line the wood-paneled walls.  A glass-topped maoral table abuts one wall, its glossy surface nearly obscured by stacks of boxes and crates, each stamped with an exotic pictograph."
