    "Aside from the debris near the room's entry, this small study is undisturbed.  Tarnished brass candelabra flank the doorway, each still supporting a half-burnt candle.  Dust-covered shelves line the walls, each covered with a stretch of tomes and texts, and a large wooden desk rests near the northern wall.  A dark bear-skin rug rests on floor before the empty cobblestone fireplace in the eastern wall."
