    "The closeness of the walls in this burrow make you uneasy.  Visible signs of a large animal cover the area in the form of deep claw marks.  Loose dirt and pebbles occupy the floor while a single curious root dangles from the ceiling.  An unending procession of water droplets dive from the root forming a small murky pool on the ground."
