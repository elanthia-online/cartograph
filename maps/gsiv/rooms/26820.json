    "A long wooden bar stretches the entire length of the far wall, and above it hangs a small painting.  A row of wool-covered barstools, crafted in various heights, sit before the polished counter.  Small tables and chairs cover the planked floor, each dimly lit by a single candle.  Off to one corner, a group of drunken halflings argue loudly over a game of cards."
