    "Jagged ends of broken wood peek out from beneath the mossy undergrowth, the remnants of a hand-crafted dwelling which has succumbed to the will of the forest or some darker entity.  Black oaks stand silent vigil over the crumbling path, their grey bark peeling back in long slivers.  The malady which afflicts them has drained them of their strength, their branches bending toward the earth and their limbs nearly leafless.",
