    "Multicolored fabric bolts in variegated finishes and textures stream along the perimeter of the ship's stowage area, trailing off before a beaded sewing room curtain.  Oil lamps hanging from the bulkheads suffuse the room with a rich amber glow, spilling out across a woolen tapestry carpet laid down to minimize the creaking of the boards underfoot.  A well-kept leather textile case is opened atop some cloth-filled cabinets, adjacent to a fully covered wall of broad, fabric-stacked shelves."
