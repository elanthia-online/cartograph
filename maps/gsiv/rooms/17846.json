    "This is evidently a common area for the servants and maids.  The only furnishings are a few simple but comfortable chairs surrounding a small wooden table.  A member of the guild's hired help passes through occasionally, carrying loads of linens or empty sacks.  Several oil lamps adorn wall mounted sconces, lending a flickering illumination to the setting."
