  "description": [
    "Peering downslope between the modwirs, you get a panoramic view of the next valley over to the west, and a glimpse of the Darkstone Bay to the north.  The rocky slope is treacherous here though, so you pull your attention away from the land miles away and back to what's under your feet, as you continue along the path."
