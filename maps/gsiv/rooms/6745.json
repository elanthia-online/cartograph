    "The stream meanders through the rocky meadowlands, wandering lazily into the trees to the north.  Where it enters the forest, you catch a glimpse of a large pool of water nestled in the modwirs and pines.  The natural boundary of the pasture has been expanded up the slope to the northwest, and scattered stumps can be seen dotting the hillside."
