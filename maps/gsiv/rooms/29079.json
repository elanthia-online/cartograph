  "description": [
    "Built into the attic and surrounded by exposed roof beams on either side, the long loft is filled with narrow cots covered in white sheets, woolen blankets, and knitted throws.  Footlockers rest at the foot of each, their edges perched upon a braided rug of black, brick red, and slate blue.  A single window allows the sunlight to filter into the space, while a descending staircase along the eastern wall leads to the floor below."
