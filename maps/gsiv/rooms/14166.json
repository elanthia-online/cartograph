  "description": [
    "The small winding staircase comes to an end here, revealing the luxurious, spacy room that spreads out before you.  A low-set maoral table stands in the middle of the room, its reflective surface mirroring the gentle wind-like patterns incised upon the walls.  Soft crimson carpets hide nearly all of the lustrous grey wood, their dark tones matching the curving contours of the dark velvet couch set before the table."
