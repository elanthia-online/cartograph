    "Although the area is shrouded in the dense fog, the shifting of the roadway stones underfoot and the press of a breeze out of the north suggest that at least the northern battlement is missing and that the highroad ends abruptly within the next stride or two.  Further travel to the east is therefore too dangerous to consider."
