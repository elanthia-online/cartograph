    "The trail through the orchard ends abruptly, the growth of trees blocked by the steep rise of jagged hills that reach northward toward a range of higher foothills.  The few saplings that struggle to grow on the side of the hill are already losing the battle for life, most of their greenery gnawed off by wild beasts."
