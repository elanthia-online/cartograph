    "The trail disappears into a thick growth of nettle bushes, which only a rabbit could comfortably navigate.  Long thorns peek from clumps of leaves along the tangle of branches.  On some of the thorns, carcasses of birds are impaled.  The small bodies hang limply from the barbs like grisly ornaments on the vicious shrubs."
