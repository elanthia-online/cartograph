    "Creating a splash of glimmering color beneath the surface of the dark water, a school of tiny silver fish dart back and forth near the shoreline of the lagoon to nibble at algae, then shift away when the water laps too roughly.  Fireflies flicker in and out near the fragrant flowers dotting the expanse of shoreline, while the shadow-encased trees and shrubs of the jungle serve as an eerie backdrop to a decorated bamboo hut flanked by flickering torches."
