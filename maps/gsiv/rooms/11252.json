    "Old, tattered cobwebs hang from the ceiling and the dusty, brass oil lamp.  The tiled hallway floor is badly scratched and scored.  Tiny, half-rusted metal shavings litter the floor.  As you move through the hallway the metal shavings grind into the tile under your feet, creating a whispery screech."
