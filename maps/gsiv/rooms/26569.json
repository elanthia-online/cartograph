    "Natural curvature in the stone walls serves as ledges for displaying wares in this part of the cave.   Near a bend in the passageway, an upright translucent glaes display stained with shimmering blue-green algae provides some illumination.  Intermittent drips offer an irregular rhythym to punctuate the silence of the cave.  A billowing, grey mist encircles clothing for purchase and perusers alike, seeming to squeeze them tightly before retreating into roiling pools on the ground.",
