    "The ancient silvery-barked oaks pull in close, their tall trunks ascending toward the sky to block out most of the light -- the thin golden shafts shining through the canopy like divine gifts from the heavens.  Massive, sprawling roots crawl along the forest floor, their gnarled surfaces covered with a fine, soft carpet of deep green moss.  A weathered path winds its way through the small bushes and trees, its presence barely noticed amid the majesty of the surrounding forest.",
