    "The ancient silvery-barked oaks pull in close, their tall trunks ascending toward the sky to block out most of the light -- the thin golden shafts shining through the canopy like divine gifts from the heavens.  Massive, sprawling roots crawl along the forest floor, their gnarled surfaces covered with a fine, soft carpet of deep green moss.  A weathered path winds its way through the small bushes and trees, its presence barely noticed amid the majesty of the surrounding forest.",

Massive, sprawling roots crawl along the forest floor, their gnarled surfaces covered with a fine, soft carpet of deep green moss.  A weathered path winds its way through the small bushes and trees, its presence barely noticed amid the majesty of the surrounding forest."
