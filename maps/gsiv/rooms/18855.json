  "description": [
    "Dark and cavernous, your eyes take a moment to adjust to the minimal light of the chamber.  Shadows huddle in far recesses, cloaking mysteries that have never seen the light of day.  A quiet stillness pervades the chamber, allowing your senses to rest in peace.  In the center of the chamber stands a velvety black malachite altar that pulses with ebon light, while an unlit brazier stands behind it like a brooding sentinel.  A spiral staircase leads upstairs."
