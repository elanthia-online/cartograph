  "description": [
    "This part of the hallway is decorated in tapestries which were hung methodically in rows.  Each of the handwoven marvels depicts various acts of self-sacrifice: a valiant warrior placing himself in front of a fallen friend, a noble-looking lady giving her cloak to an impoverished child and many other similar scenes."
