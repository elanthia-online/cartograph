    "A large oak-framed bed has been overturned near the center of this small room, its mattress torn to shreds and its linen missing.  A battered cabinet, its drawers smashed open and ripped from their hinges, lies on its side against a ruined wall.  Apparently, anything of value has long since been pilfered from this bedchamber."
