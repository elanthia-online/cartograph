  "description": [
    "This expansive chamber is roughly triangular, and features richly carved rosewood panelled walls which depict scenes of the Gods of Light.  An antique crystal chandelier hangs from a domed ceiling, illuminating the red-veined white marble floors and a sizable four poster cedar bed in one corner.  A fireplace flanked by two armchairs fills another corner, while a round malachite-topped cherrywood table surrounded by comfy red pillows stands before a huge shelf filled with books."
