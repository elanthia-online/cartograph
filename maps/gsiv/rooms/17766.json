    "Water trickles along the rocks, among the medley of flowering azaleas and red fall berries that litter the garden landscape, combining to soothe the senses and offer a meditative repose from the hard physical labours of the gymnasium.  A well-groomed sandy walkway meanders throughout the garden."
