    "High stone walls reach toward the dim lights of the starry sky, their smooth facades punctuated by small clusters of lichen and withered clumps of pale grass.  A pile of large boulders has fallen here, blocking further passage to the north.  Oddly, the towering stone walls do not appear to have crumbled or been damaged, cloaking the origin of the tumbled boulders in mystery.",

A pile of large boulders has fallen here, blocking further passage to the north.  Oddly, the towering stone walls do not appear to have crumbled or been damaged, cloaking the origin of the tumbled boulders in mystery."
