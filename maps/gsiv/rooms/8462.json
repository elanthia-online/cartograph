    "Dark grey clouds hang low across the tops of the peaks around you.  The occasional rumble of thunder startles you, loud in the silence that hangs over the area.  The mountainsides are a brownish green, as if the plants that grow there are fighting for survival...and losing the battle.  The trail winds through a pass in the mountains to the northwest, and retreats to the east, towards Sentoph.",
    "Clouds obscure the stars and cloak the tops of the peaks around you.  The occasional rumble of thunder startles you, loud in the silence that hangs over the area.  The foliage that covers the mountainside is sere, as if the plants that grow there are fighting for survival...and losing the battle.  The trail winds through a pass in the mountains to the northwest, and retreats to the east, towards Sentoph."
