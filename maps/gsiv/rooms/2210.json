    "The crawlway angles sharply here, making climbing treacherous.  Razor-sharp pieces of crystallized volcanic glass protrude from the ash-covered surface.  The walls of this pipe-like tunnel close in tightly around you, making passage slow going.  Smoky hot silt and soot swirl upward from below."
