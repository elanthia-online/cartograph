  "description": [
    "Eastward and westward the trail extends along the flat plateau, unbroken by the crevices that spread like jagged lightning across the Dead Plateau's interior.  The ground is hard, all soil blown away long ago by the ceaseless wind, and nothing attempts to live in this severe climate.  Without soil, without rain, nothing attracts plants or animals.  The sound of rushing water comes from the east, audible in small snatches when the wind chooses to abate momentarily."
