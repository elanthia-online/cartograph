    "Half a dozen wooden poles have been uprooted from the dry ground, each one tightly knotted with a length of frayed rope.  Attached to the end of the restraints are the remains of various animals, some cleaned of all flesh, while others have been left in lumps of hide and hooves.  A rusted axe sits untouched amongst the dead grass, the outline of its former owner only a few feet away."
