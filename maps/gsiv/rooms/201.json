  "description": [
    "A round belltower, capped with a dark lapis-tiled spire, occupies the center of the courtyard.  Atop the spire, the silver and sapphire pennant of House Illistim waves slightly in the night breeze.  A thanot door appears to be the only source of egress from the tower.  Near the top of the dark grey granite structure, a small window is barely visible.",
