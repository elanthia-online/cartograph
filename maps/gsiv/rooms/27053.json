    "[Careless Cobweb Table]"

  "description": [
    "Thick cobwebs drape over almost every surface, their spidery creators amassing a large cache of tender insect vittles for future consumption.  Sticky residue from torn webs will undoubtedly cling in disarray to the attire, equipment, or bodies of those who wander in to sit at the old table in this darkened corner."
