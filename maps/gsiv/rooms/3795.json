  "description": [
    "The ground dives sharply over the edge of the peak here.  The drop is dizzying and you turn your gaze to the south.  A great plain stretches southwards as far as you can see.  A trail wends its way down the southern face of Thanatoph towards the plain below, but you can't see how to get to the trail from here."
