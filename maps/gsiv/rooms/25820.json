    "Fingers of land rise from the ocean floor as the water surges around a small island, though no visible sign of landfall can be seen.  Churned by the proximity of the nearby docks on the west, the ocean is riddled with cross-waves that collide with one another and produce a cool, misty spray that rains down upon everything within its reach."
