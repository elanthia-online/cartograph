    "A ridge rises on the opposite bank of a stream rushing through the forest.  Oaks crowd around it, as if nurturing it and protecting it from harm.  Boulders, mottled with lichen and rich with veining, frame the singing brook on each side.  Quaint cabins dot the nearer side of the watercourse, sheltered by the oaks and serenaded by the stream."
