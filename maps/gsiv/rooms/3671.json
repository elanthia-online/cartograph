    "Inside the cramped confines of the booth is an iron teller's cage from which the beady eyes of a swarthy gnome in uniform peer back.  Wreaths of island flowers attempt to soften the otherwise foreboding iron.  A pair of local guardsmen bearing pole-axes wander in occasionally to survey the surroundings."
