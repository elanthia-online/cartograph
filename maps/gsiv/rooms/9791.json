    "Thick roots worm their way along the walls and ceiling, several of the thinner tendrils hanging limply in the still, musty air.  A few warped pieces of metal jut up from the floor, while others are nearly buried in the smooth earth.  Miniscule cracks wind along the walls, clusters of tiny mushrooms peeking through some of the small crevices."
