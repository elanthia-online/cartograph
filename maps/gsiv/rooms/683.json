    "Two small cottages face one another across the trail, each equally tidy and charming.  While one's walls are made of smooth river rock and mortar, the other's walls have been plastered with creamy colored stucco.  Golden light spills from the windows of both cottages, gently illuminating the night.",

Each boasts a thick red clay tile roof, which provides a convenient roosting place for several birds."
