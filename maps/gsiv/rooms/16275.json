  "description": [
    "A large stone idol dominates this small clearing in the jungle-covered ruins.  Directly in front of the idol is a long slab of native riverstone.  The front of the idol is covered with tacky gore.  Flies swarm everywhere.  The stink of putrefaction and death casts a pall over the area."
