  "description": [
    "The river has cut its way through the forest as its waters rush down from the northern mountains towards Wehnimer's Landing.  Smooth boulders sticking out of the water and rough rapids deter any thoughts of trying to swim across the swiftly moving waters.  An old wooden foundation of a bridge sits on the bank.  A tight rope stretches over the river, tied around trees on each side of the river."
