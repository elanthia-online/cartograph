    "Layers of thick wool line the frame of the canopy tent, locking the heat from a small copper brazier inside.  A tall polished brass rack of clothing makes a colorful wall along the back of the area.  Wooden planks cover the ground to create a make-shift floor.  Thick carpets give the space some semblance of elegance, their woven patterns creating the symbols of the six Dai.  Hanging from the pine frame is a small sign."
