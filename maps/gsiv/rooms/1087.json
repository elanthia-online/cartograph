    "Below, two waves appear to meet and stand still.  To the northeast a blanket of fog hides the land under its heavy, billowy cloud cover.  To the southwest, a low range of mountains undulates across the landscape, barren and arid.  The two meet head-on in a line just below you that runs directly off to the southeast until it meets a third natural formation--a thick forest that neither the fog nor the mountains seem ready to assault."
