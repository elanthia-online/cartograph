    "A glaesine-topped bloodwood workbench dominates the cramped laboratory, one end pushed against the wall so it is beneath a septagonal window.  Atop the window-side of the workbench rests a complicated, mithglin gem lens assembly.  A glass alembic and a sun-carved, saffron marble crucible also congregate on the workbench.  Scorch marks mar the white marble floors, and a curtained arch leads southwest to the main hallway.  Starlight trickles on a gold-leafed hostas sitting in the lone, unscorched corner.",
