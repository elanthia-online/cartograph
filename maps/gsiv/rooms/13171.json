    "A lane picks up at the foot of a carved wooden bridge spanning a swiftly coursing creek.  Tall sycamore and oak trees leave the lane in shadows, providing a perfect habitat for tall clumps of ferns and immense rhododendron bushes.  To the south, the road disappears into the darkness.  However, the scent of wood smoke betrays the possibility of dwellings hidden from sight.",
