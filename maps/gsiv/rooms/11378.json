    "Sawdust on the floor makes your footing uncertain here.  Stone weights, target dummies and a hacking post are positioned about the room.  On the far wall is a well-used knife target.  Against one wall stands a rack of wooden practice weapons.  Several charts are plastered to the walls showing wrestling holds and areas of the body which will cripple or critically wound a foe."
