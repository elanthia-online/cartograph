  "description": [
    "Large and small plaques clutter the walls of the shop displaying a variety of mounted fish species and leaving no room for anything else, as evidenced by the cloaks and longcoats that are discarded on the floor beneath a window.  Various cases, shelves, and cabinets house a motley assortment of fishing gear, while a counter set in the center of the store holds lures and lines.  A faint track of mud and seaweed discolors the floorboards, its trail distinctly leading to and from the door."
