    "The entire room is nearly dominated by a long, rectangular pool sheltered under a clear glaes ceiling admitting brilliant sunlight and the gardens outside.  Yellow-gold tiles create a whimsical sunburst mosaic along the bottom of the pool, and upon the benches that ring the apron.  Water feeds in through several waterfall-like openings lining the sides, creating a soft hypnotic rush.",
