  "description": [
    "A dark granite-clad guild hall rests at the curve of the var, its square blocked walls featureless and impervious to all save the ravages of weather and the ages.  An iron-bound mithglin door is the only visible entrance to the structure.  Twin torches, glowing amber in the darkness, flank the door.",
