    "Noticeably cooler than the area above, this area seems to be more recessed below the ground.  A bowl made of a large resin-encased leaf and a carved wooden tray stand side by side on a natural rock ledge from which a large strip of bark is hung.  Sitting on the ground, a hollowed out log is nestled close to the mass of roots that leads upwards.  In darkened corner, you can just make out the image of a braided vine ladder which leads through a narrow hole in the ground."
