  "description": [
    "Emerging from a hole in the wall, the descent of the waterfall slows abruptly, caught on ledges that jut from the wall, before flowing to the floor.  Rivulets wander through fine crevices, feeding pale toadstools, mushrooms, moss, and fungus, while a serpentine bench winds throughout.  Though white is the primary plant color, all the hues of the rainbow appear in speckles, resembling dollops of whipped cream dotted with jellied candies.  The rivulets join near an octagonal stone receptacle to plunge into a hole in the floor."
