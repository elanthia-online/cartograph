  "description": [
    "The path winds through a thicket of firs, with small trails leading off to homes set deep among the trees.  Little snow has reached the ground here, but the branches around and above you are covered with glistening patterns of frost and ice.  A white ermine pokes his head up from behind the low stone wall, almost invisible against the patches of snow."
