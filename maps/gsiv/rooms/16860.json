    "Muted green paint covers the walls from edge to edge, and a chalkboard hangs off to one side.  From the vantage point of the office's simple steel desk, there is a clear line of sight to the building's foyer, allowing observation of all those who come and go.  A wrought iron lectern stands next to a small bookcase housing several large tomes.  Suspended from one corner of the ceiling is a hammered brass bowl with verdant hanging moss spilling over its sides in lacy clumps."
