    "Massive chains stretch up into the sky at a steep angle, and disappear from sight in some thick, slowly moving clouds.  A bird trills loudly as it darts through the middle of one of the links before diving straight down towards the ground far below.  The air feels thin as the chains subtly sway like a pendulum before coming to a halt."
