  "description": [
    "A variety of thick wooden planks provides a sturdy footing at the top of the staircase, the walls opening up into a variety of narrow slitted windows.  Various scuffs, nicks and scorches mar the otherwise smooth stone walls, a telltale sign of the many battles fought here.  A larger window harbors a long piece of rope tied to a grommet, the majority of its length arranged in long serpentine coils."
