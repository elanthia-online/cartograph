    "The road crumbles at the edges here, and even the center of the path is soft enough to give underfoot.  Puddles stagnate on the path, creating a foul, oppressive odor that hangs constantly in the still air.  Mosquitoes swarm around travelers as they splash along the path, looking for a bit of exposed flesh for a quick meal."
