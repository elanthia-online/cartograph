  "description": [
    "The compact lines of stores and houses open for a small alleyway that ascends toward the heart of the village.  A large family of crows has nested along the rooftops near the side-street, and the shrill calls pierce the air consistently.  The tower on the hill can clearly be seen to the northeast, portions of its length shrouded in fog."
