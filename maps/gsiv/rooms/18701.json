  "description": [
    "Pots and pans, cooking utensils, and bundles of herbs hang from racks to either side of a black iron stove and a large double sink on the south wall.  Oak cabinets line the west wall.  A sturdy worktable takes up the center of the tiled floor, and a wrought iron chandelier with unlit oil lamps hangs above it.  Barrels of bulk food supplies are lined up beneath the windows framing the doorway in the east wall.  To the north are two bramble-carved ironwood benches placed on either side of a matching table."
