  "description": [
    "Bunks line the walls of the deckhouse.  Beneath each bunk sits a highly polished, wooden sea chest with shining brass hardware.  The bunks are strung with heavy hemp cording, and a blanket rests at the foot of each, neatly folded.  A small window on the forward bulkhead offers light, amplified by the pristine white walls."
