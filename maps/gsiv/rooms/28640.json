    "Silver-inlaid black marble encompasses the walls and floor of this large room, thousands of tiny sparkling diamonds imbedded in the ceiling resemble the deep night sky.  Plush silver silk rugs and large pillows adorned with patterns of wild black roses cover the floor around an elegant fel table.  A large marble fireplace dominates the far wall, the constantly burning fire providing light and warmth in this dark room."
