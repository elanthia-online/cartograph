  "description": [
    "A circle of twelve willow trees encompasses the area, their thick boughs providing curtains of shimmering leaves and a wealth of shady spots to relax.  Standing at the exact center of the willows, nearly hidden among their drooping vines, is a small hut, its thatched construction imparting an air of coziness.  Soft grass covers the area, and leaves float idly by on gentle currents of wind.  A small firepit is set outside the hut, a ring of grey rocks keeping any flames at bay."
