    "The star-filled sky shows clearly through the clear-cut crystal that covers the top of the tower, yet keeps out the cool night air.  The room is warm and humid and the air is heavy with the scent of tropical flowers.  You can hear the trickle and splash of water from somewhere in the dark dense foliage, filling the broad room with all manner of dark, monstrous shapes.",
    "Lush greenery of tropical plants and flowers fills the broad room.  Pools and fountains of splashing water are hidden within the dense foliage.  The cries of numerous birds ring throughout the top of the tower that is covered with a clear cut crystal that lets in sunlight and warmth, making the room hot and humid."
