    "The room is decorated to resemble a primitive swamp-hut, with rough-sawn planks comprising the walls showing gaps where they have shrunk.  Green beard moss hangs from the corners in thick, curly tangles.  Within a cauldron hung on a crane in the fireplace, a thick aromatic concoction bubbles, filling the room with the mouthwatering aroma of stew.  A narrow bed with a patchwork quilt provides a place to sleep, and a rough table and chair offer a place to sit."
