    "A warm scent of wood polish and herbal incense fills the cozy workroom, and the golden light of half a dozen hand-blown glass oil lamps illuminates the richly panelled walls.  Alphel, a stout, middle-aged human clad in finely made, but casual cotton tunic and leather trousers, mutters instructions to his clerks as he returns his attention to polishing a slab of fine golden haon."
