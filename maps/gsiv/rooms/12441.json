    "Polished gold candelabras and elegant crystal chandeliers lend plenty of light to the many three-walled mock-up rooms that comprise this large establishment.  Each room displays how well the proprietor's products integrate with other stylish home furnishings.  A large music box fills the room with cheery sounds as its windup key slowly turns.  Several clerks in matching aprons dash this way and that, each with a customer in tow, while rattling off the features and specifications of the merchandise."
