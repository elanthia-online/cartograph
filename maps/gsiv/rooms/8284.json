  "description": [
    "A humble hut is wedged here between the underbrush and the sparse trees bordering the clearing.  The wooden hut is thatched with straw and unadorned in any way.  A ragged, greasy hide hangs over the doorway, in front of which you notice a bare patch of earth strewn with chips of flint and obsidian."
