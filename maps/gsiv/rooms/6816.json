  "description": [
    "Past travellers' attempts to carve a path further upward on the face of the great mountain have failed miserably.  A pile of dirt, boulders and brush has tumbled down and formed a crude barrier, dissuading future foolhardy efforts.  Amidst the rubble are some torn pieces of leather battle armor, stained with old dried blood."
