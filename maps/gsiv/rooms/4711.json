  "description": [
    "A brook babbles in happily from the northwest then veers to its right and follows the slight decline of the cobblestone road to the southwest.  The brook's waters are clear and cool, and the exposed stones carry not the slightest indication of algae or any ominous discolorations.  The accumulated dirt on the brook's banks indicates that it is at its heaviest flow point right now.  Perhaps, in other seasons, it ceases to flow entirely, accounting for the lack of fish within."
