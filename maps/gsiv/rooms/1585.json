    "An empty wagon stands outside a closed up warehouse on the Row's south side.  A small stack of tar-stained barrels stand outside the door, ready for loading or were perhaps unloaded after the warehouse was closed.",
    "A crew of bare chested Giantmen roll tar-stained barrels out of a warehouse on the Row's south side, up a plank and into the back of a wagon.  Within the shaded interior of the low building, rows of barrels and hogsheads are stacked to the rafters, and the crew's leader discusses payment with the overseer of the warehouse."
