    "This section of the deck lies beneath the ship's foremast, the peak of which is some fifty feet above your head.  A flight of stairs leads up from here to the forecastle, while the gangplank and the cargo hatch lie aft of here along the deck.  Underneath the forecastle you spot a door leading inside."
