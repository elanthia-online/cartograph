    "The fog seems to be all around and overhead.  Chilly, damp tendrils reach down to moisten clothing, skin and hair with their clammy touch.  Although the fog is a thick, wet blanket, it still allows vision for perhaps a hundred yards.  If only there were more to look at other than a sea of tall grass extending motionlessly in all directions."
