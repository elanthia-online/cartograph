    "Mingling smells of acrid smoke, rotten eggs, and burnt hair permeate this enclosed shack.  A huge cauldron sits in a tiny stone hearth at one end of the room, the ceiling above stained black with soot.  A scarred wooden work table is pushed into one corner, a stool sitting in front of it, while a long battered wooden shelf is mounted directly above it.  A warped metal cabinet with corroded acid stains marring the front, the interior filled with wares, takes up almost the entire back wall.  A discolored wooden door leads to the backyard, its surface littered with a plethora of pinned papers covered in cramped handwriting."
