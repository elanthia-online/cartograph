  "description": [
    "A huge oak tree, split in twain by lightning, lies rotting among several broken headstones.  The base of the charred tree has long since been sucked into the mud that threatens to devour everything in sight.  Carved into every available surface of the wood are initials and brief messages left behind by previous visitors."
