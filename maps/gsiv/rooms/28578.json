    "Bunk beds, footed with oaken lockers, are stacked three high and line the pine walls of this utilitarian bungalow.  A large central table covered with mugs, plates, and discarded utensils occupies the center of the room, while a cast iron wood stove, whose pipe exits through the ceiling, squats next to a blue cupboard filled with various cooking pans.  Standing by the entry, a yellow cubbyhole shelf and a sturdy wooden rack offer space for boots and fishing equipment."
