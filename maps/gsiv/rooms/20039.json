    "The room is filled with bubbling magma.  A small island sits in the center of the pool, connected to the outside by a thin stone bridge.  On the island stands a tall statue of a woman, her wings stretching high into the cavern.  Pieces of skeletons ring both shores of the lava lake, some trying to crawl away, others towards the beautiful statue.  A pedestal of stone rests at her feet."
