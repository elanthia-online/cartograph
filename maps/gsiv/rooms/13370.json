    "A black-shingled building huddles in the shadows of the ivory-hued walls to the southeast, faint trails of smoke rising up from its chimney.  The area is shrouded in a haze of pale crimson and deep purple as the leaves of the surrounding magnolia trees whisper to one another with every stray breeze.  The pristine white walkway continues on to the northeast, its surface riddled with tiny leaves."
