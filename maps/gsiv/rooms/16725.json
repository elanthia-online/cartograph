    "The wind sweeps across the surface of the wall, tugging at a small bush which clings to a stone plaque carved out of the living stone.  Below, the swiftly moving waters of the river Anguindel create a permanent muted roar that reverberates up the walls of the ravine.  Meanwhile, above, a large rope leading upward sways back and forth in the wind.  Besides climbing the rope, the only other possibility is leaping to the ravine floor below."
