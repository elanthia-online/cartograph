    "The vast space of the cavern is broken by four immense, spiraling pillars, which stretch between the shadows cloaking the ceiling and the perfect slab floor beneath.  Frayed shapes composed of ground fog undulate around the feet of the columns and across the blood-red floor, like wispy phantoms engaged in a slow-motion dance.  A circular well occupies the center of the chamber, surrounded by the columns as if guarded by them and its bottom lost in darkness."
