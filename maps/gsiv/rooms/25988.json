    "Well-packed earth sends a loamy aroma floating through the chilly air and makes up the entirety of the capacious basement's walls and floor.  A small, disordered pile of crates and an exceedingly large mountain of crates are stacked near one another behind a rickety stairway.  Flickering lanterns hang from several hooks in the plank ceiling, casting three charcoal-hued couches, a dead root table, and a partially preserved cook's assistant corpse in a dappled mixture of light and shadow.Well-packed earth sends a loamy aroma floating through the chilly air and makes up the entirety of the capacious basement's walls and floor.
