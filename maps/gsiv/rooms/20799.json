  "description": [
    "The sweet scent of cothinar flower and a brilliant, gold light assail your senses.  In the center of the room is a comfortable-looking, carved rowan bed, draped in white spidersilk hangings and stacked high with emerald silk pillows.  Across the room, over a stone fireplace, your eyes are drawn to a painting hanging above the mantle.  On a far wall, in front of a window, a cothinar plant sits atop a table.  Across the ceiling, a glowing mural spans from wall to wall."
