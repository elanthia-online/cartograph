    "This spartan room has been half-heartedly ransacked.  The narrow bed has been turned on its side, the small nightstand lies in pieces, and the cushion of the stiff-backed wooden chair has been ripped open.  The wind whistles through the cracked pane of the small, round window set high on the wall."
