    "Dust motes dance in a beam of light that illuminates the seal of the Black Wolves which is set in the center of the rough stone floor.  The faint crackle of magic hovers over a tangle of broken weapons and shattered armor next to a long table placed under some low-hanging shelves.  A painted mural depicting a flight of dragons soaring through a twilight sky climbs the granite walls of the circular chamber, ending at an iron grate set high above."
