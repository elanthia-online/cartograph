    "Light filters through a small stained glass window onto a simple altar covered in white samite.  A prie-dieu has been placed directly in front of the altar, holding a small prayerbook on the elbow rest.  The rest of the room has been paneled and floored in honey-colored oak that lacks any adornment."
