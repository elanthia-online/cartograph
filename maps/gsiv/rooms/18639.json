  "description": [
    "Only a single candle provides light in this cramped chamber, and the very air seems to reject your presence with a startlingly cold chill.  Huge tentacles carved from stone fade in and out of the darkness as the candle flame flickers softly.  As the shadows and light dance across their surfaces, it gives the impression of being within the writhing, living mass of some otherwordly creature.  A statue of some horrible beast stands to the southeast, a squat obsidian altar crouching before it."
