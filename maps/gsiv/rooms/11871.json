    "The soft emerald glow from the slowly moving stream barely illuminates the granite floor and the lower portions of the walls on either side of the tunnel.  The walls disappear into darkness farther up, and for all one knows the ceiling could be several hundred feet above, or just a scant few feet.  Noises echo, but in all directions at once, and they give no dependable indication of distances.  Only the sloshing green water and the pressing granite walls are apparent."
