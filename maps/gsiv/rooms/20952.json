  "description": [
    "Raised above the level of the rest of the valley, the plateau is a haven for huge ferns and even a few of the larger jungle trees.  From this vantage point, a section of coastal cliff is plainly visible in the distance.  One fallen tree trunk forms a bridge of sorts to a small ridge in those cliffs.  To the south the sloping sides of the tableland provide a natural descent to the floor of the cirque below."
