    "Standing out because of its crisp, but darker lines, as well as its location, the high wall surrounding the estate at the southern corner of the intersection is constructed entirely of grey brick.  Wrought iron arabesques and spikes adorn the top of the wall and the felwood gates at the compound's entrance."
