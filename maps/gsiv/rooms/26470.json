    "The leather panels of a Tehir-styled pavilion hide the walls in this small building, complete with short strings of amber beads hanging from the roof.  A three-flamed oil lamp on a spindly brass stand fills the room with light and the scent of sandalwood, while a layer of furs covers whatever floor lies underfoot.  Near the oil lamp, a cedar display stand occupies the shop's center, a small table sits to one side, and an armor rack stands near the back wall."
