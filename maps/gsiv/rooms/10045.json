    "Blackened dirt and moisture have collected in a low patch of ground to form a malodorous bog, the mucky ground dotted with ghostly, protruding branches and scattered shards of half-buried bone and stone.  The cold wind that blows the shifting coils of mist across the moor is not enough to disperse a constant, sickly smell of death and decay."
