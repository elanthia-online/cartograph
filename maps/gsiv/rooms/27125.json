    "Ascending terrain complicates travel along the dense path edging a rocky plateau.  Mist cascading down from the top of the falls resembles miniature crystals sparkling with the reflection of the lush hues of the jungle.  Slick and gleaming with condensation, the surface of the outcropping levels out to accommodate exploration, while the path provides a way to the next level of the waterfall."
