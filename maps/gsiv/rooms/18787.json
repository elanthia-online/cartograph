    "The upper hallway terminates with a solid, green-tinged glaesine wall with verdigris copper mullions, matching the peaked ceiling above.  Myriad vines, having wormed their way up from the cloister, vie for space along the wall and ceiling, casting shadows on the starlit pale acantha green floors.  Ornate intaglios, carved into the limestone walls, encompass healing and alchemical motifs, and four small curtained arches lead off the main hallway.",
