    "This scaffold rises against the ruined chamber's southern wall, much of which has been chipped away to reveal a thick vein of rainbow glaes.  If anything, the destruction of the room below looks worse from this height.  Large shadows shift unnaturally upon the ceiling, a disturbing sign that this mine is not wholly abandoned."
