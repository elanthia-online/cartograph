  "description": [
    "The wind whistles around you as it passes along this side of the town walls.  The road leading up to the gate itself is merely a dirt path but you notice it has seen some extensive use.  A huge snowbank is off to one side from all the snow being removed in front of the gates.  Just to the south of the gate is a stout building with a large sign over the door that reads \"The Icehouse Tavern\"."
