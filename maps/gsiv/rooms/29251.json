    "The marble walls are punctuated with several glass cases, each of which is set either above or below an inlaid copper strip.  The metallic band stretches from the right to the left side of a copper-plated arch, circumnavigating the room in the process.  A square tile of the same copper as the arch and timeline is inset into the center of the floor."
