    "A sphere-hilted mounted sword plaque hangs on one of the dark blue textured canvas walls, and a viridian Vornavian silk ceiling rises overhead.  A woven Vornavian silk rug sits in one corner of an ash grey granite floor.  There is a Vornavian silk-lined display case on one side of the shop and a Vornavian silk-covered table on the other."
