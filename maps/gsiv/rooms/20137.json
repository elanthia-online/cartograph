    "The interior of the shack is as gaudily cheerful and brightly colored as the exterior.  The walls are studded with glittering tourmalines and glimaerstones, and slick, shiny bits of shells dangle from long colored ribbons from the corrugated tin roof.  A few chinks in the facade of conspicuous grandeur can be spied here and there.  Slender needles of light seep inside from narrow cracks between the lacquered wall planks, and several spatterings of tiny rust spots dot the roof."
