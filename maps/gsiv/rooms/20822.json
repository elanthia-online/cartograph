    "Oil lamps hang from the tips of stalactites in this small natural cavern, sending shadows scurrying across the rough-hewn stone as they sway.  Some intricately carved chests are nestled between the matching stalagmites and appear rooted to the stone.  Rich brocaded tapestries of green and silver cling to the eastern and western walls, adding a touch of color and warmth to the otherwise stark vault."
