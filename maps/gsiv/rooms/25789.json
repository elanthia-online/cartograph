    "Polished white birch floors support the tongue-in-groove wainscoting that rises to mid wall before giving way to pristine white stucco.  Gauze-framed windows occupy the space to either side of a wide black oak entry, while the northern wall is decorated with a plethora of paintings that surround a black oak door.  The eastern wall houses a flagstone fireplace topped with a smooth black oak mantle.  Arranged in social circles at the heart of the room, a pair of white wicker chairs faces a two-cushioned loveseat over the broad expanse of a low glass-topped table."
