    "You smile as you enter this cool and pleasant secret room.  A small table next to an overstuffed velvet armchair bears a few rare vintages and some premier products of the brewery.  Several rock crystal glasses of Gnollish design, a brass corkscrew and a silver salver rest on a rack against the wall."
