    "Wild roots and jungle plants surround the area, but only short grass and stone cover the ground directly below your feet.  Cobblestones jut from the grass in places and create a path leading to a flimsy rope ladder.  Below the ladder is a marble fountain and a nearby bench that faces a swiftly moving stream to the west."
