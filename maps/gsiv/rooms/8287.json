  "description": [
    "The hut reeks of noxious smoke and dead animals.  Along the left wall are hung fresh velnalin hides, stretched out to cure.  An obsidian knife, crudely fashioned and covered with dried blood, sits upon a split tree trunk.  The trunk has been split vertically, and serves as a long, flat work surface."
