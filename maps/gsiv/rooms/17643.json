    "Several plush velvet sofas are scattered throughout this room, small tables set with vases of roses resting next to them.  Some of the couches are occupied by people either scribbling on small pieces of paper, or staring intently at the platform at the front of the room.  A slender elf in a fashionable gown stands atop the platform occasionally pulling tokens from a box next to her and calling out numbers."
