  "description": [
    "Evenly spaced, brightly-colored pots illuminate this well-traveled tunnel with a soft white and peach glow.  The low din of bartering and trading dwarves echo off the high ceiling, occasionally pierced by the hearty laughter of a merchant striking an opportune deal.  Carts laden with goods and wares continually pass in and out of a large invar-braced archway."
