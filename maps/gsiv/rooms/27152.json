    "Centered in the tent, a thick pole creates a sharp peak in the canopy, which slopes down to a white oak post at each corner.  The vermillion silk walls billow with the breezes moving through the meadow outside.  Lengths of silken rope travel across the ceiling, creating a tangled crisscrossed pattern and display a wide variety of kites."
