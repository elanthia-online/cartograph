    "A multihued Vornavian silk tapestry hangs on one of the stark stone block walls, and a dark and light oak ceiling rises overhead.  A series of thinly woven rugs sits in one corner of an ash grey granite floor.  There is a heavy white granite counter on one side of the shop and a set of carved felwood shelves on the other."
