    "Over the top of the granite wall, the three towers of the Wizard's Guild can be seen.  Within the garden, a fourth tower looms, its crenellated crown rising over the others and dwarfing the handful of shade trees planted across the lawn.  The wide cobblestone path curves southwest toward a quiet pond and east toward the main courtyard."
