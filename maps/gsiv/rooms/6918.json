    "The bony hand of some poor unfortunate sticks out of the wall.  His arm bones have been shattered in the forearm, leaving little more than the appendage to remind the world of his existence.  An unknown culprit with a sense of humor has put a guttering torch in the hand, seeing a convenient place to hang an inexpensive light."
