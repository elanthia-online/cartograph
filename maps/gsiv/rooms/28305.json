    "The curved pathway of granite stepping stones wends its way through a natural archway of green bamboo towards an open space of powdery grey gravel.  Bordered by verdant mossy beds of ornamental japonica blossoms and weeping acers, the tranquil garden features a composed arrangement of glittering mica rocks around a cascading water fountain, close to which sits a large rattan floor mat.  The faint scent of jasmine and the gentle, smooth tone of bamboo wind chimes fills the air."
