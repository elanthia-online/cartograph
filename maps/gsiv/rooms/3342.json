    "Lamp posts line the road around Spectre Square, wavering and flickering, fitfully trying to light the plaza.  Drifting fog creates halos around the lanterns, enveloping the poles they rest on.  The flagstones paving the road are perenially wet, freezing over and melting again as feet continually trample them."
