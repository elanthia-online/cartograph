    "The tree cover finally breaks at this rocky outcropping, laying bare the breadth of the frozen woodlands below.  A gentle white haze rolls down from the mountains and over the snow-capped trees, vanishing into a mist at Lake Sasalis' edge.  From these heights, the frozen lake catches subtle hues of violet and pink, rendering the vista reflected from its surface almost as a glassy, wintry dream."
