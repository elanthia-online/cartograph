  "description": [
    "Visibility far into the distance is largely obscured by the indigo-hued waters, except for a smattering of silvery-gold rays.  The water itself is somehow thicker at this depth, enveloping and curling over everything it touches like a nebulous fog.  Buried in the sand, a skeletal arm draped with undulating seaweed clutches a silver coin in its bony hand."
