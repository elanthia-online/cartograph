    "The walls of this unassuming room are dotted with numerous tiny holes from errant dart throws.  Ripped and punctured black leather chairs line the walls, victims to the same fate as the pockmarked walls.  A black and red dart board stands opposite the door, bracketed on either side by pierced iron braziers."
