    "You stare down at a multitude of tiny droplets dancing around the cascading waterfall below you.  A fresh breeze blows in from a crevice in the wall.  As you gaze around the room, a drawing, deeply chiseled into the rock wall, catches your eye.  A small stone shelf protrudes from the wall below the drawing."
