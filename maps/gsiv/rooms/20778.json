  "description": [
    "A path of crushed seashells leads away from a set of glass double doors in the building's exterior and meanders through the lush green swath of cultured lawn.  Several stone benches rest beside the path, flanked by fanciful topiaries pruned in the shapes of local wildlife.  At the end of the path, a circular stone fountain provides relief from the heat for an array of colorful birds.  In a concentric ring around the fountain, vivid flowers bloom within a bed bordered by dark blue sea glass bricks."
