    "Like an incandescent beacon, a pure eonake altar gleams from the hallway's end.  On the wall above, a gold hammer and anvil is worked in rich bas-relief encompassed by an aureate sphere.  The hanging artwork's sunny-hued form reflects mistily off of the altar below, casting pale golden heatshimmers into the searing air."
