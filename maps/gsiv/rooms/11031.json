    "An expanse of lush grass stretches north to a pair of ivy-grown gates.  Ancient trees, their shadows long in the moonlight, almost obscure a domed building to your south, its curvilinear architecture giving it the look of having grown from the land it occupies.  A winding flagstone walkway leads to the ivy-covered gates of the guild hall.",
