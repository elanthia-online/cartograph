    "A pair of carved glimaerstone torches are mounted on the walls, their soft glow illuminating the interior of the wagon.  Worn through in places, a deerskin rug has been haphazardly tossed on the floor.  Beams of dark oak run the length of the ceiling overhead, supporting the roof of the wagon."
