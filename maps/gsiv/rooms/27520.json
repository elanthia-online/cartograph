    "Verdant vines cover the walls of the small hut.  From the ceiling hangs umcor in the shape of raven feathers.  Colorful, multi-hued cornsilk dangles from the umcor.  A low wooden table sits to one side of the room with a small sign that reads \"Women.\"  To the other side of the room is a set of vine-carved wooden shelves with a sign that reads \"Men.\""
