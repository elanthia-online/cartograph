    "Dark ruby velvet curtains frame the shop's diamond-paned glaesine windows.  The richly panelled maoral walls are carved with fanciful scenes depicting sprites and pixies dancing in a forest glade.  A lone counter rests in the center of the room, behind which the shop's clerk waits patiently for clients to exchange their gems."
