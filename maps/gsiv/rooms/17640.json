    "Very little decorates this room other than a large poster, a rules sign, and a numbers chart.  Nonetheless, it still manages to look as luxurious as the rest of the casino with polished rosewood paneling on the walls and rich crimson carpeting on the floor.  A large crystal chandelier hangs from above, illuminating the room brightly."
