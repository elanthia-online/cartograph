  "description": [
    "Nearly a cavern unto itself, the tunnel widens considerably into a large chamber illuminated by four torches set along its length.  Two alcoves have been cut into either side of the tunnel, one with stone steps leading upwards, and another with a ladder disappearing into the ceiling.  Somewhere in the darkness, crickets chirp contently."
