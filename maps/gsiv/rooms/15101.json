    "The broad sweep of the black marble floor is interrupted by a pile of striped throw pillows.  Halfway to the vaulted ceiling, a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls.  A glass-topped mistwood counter and a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
