    "The broad sweep of the black marble floor is interrupted by a pile of striped throw pillows.  Halfway to the tiled ceiling, a pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the celadon marble walls.  A brass treasure chest and an oval-shaped speckled marble counter are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
