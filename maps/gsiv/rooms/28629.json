  "description": [
    "This bedchamber is lavishly and exotically decorated.  A velvet-covered couch sits in the front corner of the room behind a low mahogany table, looking on several Dhe'nar relics and weapons set into niches in the walls.  In the back corner sits a large canopy bed, the thick dark curtains promising rest safely tucked away from the light."
