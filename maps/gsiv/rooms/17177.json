    "Curved walls of polished ebonwood support a large glass dome ceiling and form a circular room.  Thick black cushions are scattered across the floor, providing an inviting area to rest.  Telescopes are set up in three places for those who like to stargaze, and a small curtained niche to the south offers privacy for personal prayer."
