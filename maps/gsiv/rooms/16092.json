    "Stacked around the room are samples of various building materials in a variety of colors.  Although it's obvious an attempt has been made to keep the room neat and tidy, a fine layer of dust from the building materials covers the floor.  Along the walls, the tiny footprints of a mouse can be seen in the dust."
