    "Worn rocks and exposed roots form a domelike opening beneath a fallen banyan.  A twisted mass of roots covers part of the back area of the enclosure, while a hanging woven reed basket suspended from vines sways lightly from the ceiling.  A large strip of bark hangs from a gnarled protrusion of wood above a low hawthorn rack along one wall.  Near the exit, a cluster of thorny spines appears to be wedged between two rocks to provide a place for wares to hang."
