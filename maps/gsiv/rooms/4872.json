    "The remains of an arch which once spanned the road now lie tumbled across it, making passage along the ancient roadbed difficult.  The once-jagged edges of the great stone blocks have been worn smooth with age, but carvings are still faintly visible on the broad bases that once held the structure aloft.  Wildflowers grow atop the tumbled blocks, giving them the look of a terraced garden and imbuing them with a beauty at odds with the ruin they represent.",
