    "A small brook winds its way through this tranquil garden, its babbling chorus enhanced where it empties into a clear pond.  A miniature dock reaches out into the water, while climbing vines and ivies ramble over rock walls.  Central to the garden is a simple shrine, an unadorned block of black marble, residing on a moonlit court of polished flagstones.  An offering of wildflowers sits at the base of the block, and tall willows shade a long stone bench nearby."
