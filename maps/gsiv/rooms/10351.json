    "Set atop multi-tiered wooden poles of varying heights, a series of shallow, circular stone basins has been erected in a small clearing hedged by a row of squat berry bushes.  Oddly tree-like in their appearance, the artistic structures have managed to catch fallen rain water or retained the morning dew, much to the delight of a small flock of red-bellied songbirds which flutter from basin to basin, happily flapping their wings and pruning themselves in the collected moisture.",

Oddly tree-like in their appearance, the artistic structures have managed to catch fallen rain water or collected the night mist, which now forms shallow pools in each of the stone basins."
