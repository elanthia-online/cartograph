    "Hacking a path through the overgrown valley proves exceedingly difficult, slowing progress to an agonizing crawl.  Surrounded by a mass of tangled vines, trees and longgrass, the accompanying darkness makes it a challenge to see more than a few feet in front of you.  While the darkness envelops you, the chittering of insects swarming through the vegetation creates a loud droning hum."
