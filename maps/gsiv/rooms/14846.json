    "The almost overwhelming scent of wildflowers mingles on the breeze with a hint of pine.  A comfortable looking chair rests in the spot where the fence forms a corner to the northeast, and several pale green ferns are interspersed among the flowers.  The loud babbling of the carved marble fountain drowns out almost any other noise."
