    "Moonlight glints off the silvery lavender clusters of lilacs hanging from an enormous tree spreading out from behind the cloister's garth-facing columns.  A tiled mosaic cast in shadows so as to be almost indiscernible lies at the gated entrance of a polished grey basalt arch, and fragrant herbs in clusters of sandstone pots rest at either side.  Viridian vines wend overhead, a single moonflower blossom in pale lavender evident amidst the dark greenery.",
    "The view of the garth from this corner of the cloister is blocked by an enormous lilac tree spreading out from behind the inner columns, while overhead, viridian vines wend about.  Positioned on the cloister walkway in front of a polished grey basalt arch lies a mosaic of men and women heading to the baths, and pots of fragrant rosemary and thyme cluster on either side of the arch's gate."
