    "Thick crimson canvas stretched over squared oak beams forms the ceiling of the hexagonal space, leaving the sides open to errant breezes.  A refreshment table at the northern end of the room is flanked by rows of padded chairs.  In the center, short brass poles supporting a thick velvet rope encircle the polished teak floor, which is laid in a checkered pattern of darker and lighter boards."
