    "[A Dusty Storeroom]"

  "description": [
    "A jumbled collection of junk and treasure clutters the room.  Dusty, unframed paintings are propped against tables piled high with delicate vases, silver platters, golden candlesticks.  The corners are jammed with a collection of mismatched shields and weapons.  A life-sized stuffed rolton is posed as if about to charge."
