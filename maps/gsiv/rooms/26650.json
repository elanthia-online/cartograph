    "Crushed rock and sediment cover the hard-packed ground.  A large flat boulder stands vertically amidst the rubble, creating a makeshift room while blocking most of the island wind.  Wedged into cracks in the rocks, a few crude torches cast flickering shadows that seem to lick at the rocky terrain.  A cracked piece of slate has been affixed to the surface of the boulder.",
