    "Footprints from roaming neighborhood animals in search of a dry haven are temporarily enshrined in the dried mud in the middle of the road.  Sounds of cheerful music drift over on the wind from Silver Park, sharing the winds with the happy cries of children at play.  Bungalows and quaint houses are built back into the protective slopes of the gentle rolling hills abutting the neighborhood."
