    "Open sea stretches into the distance from the mouth of the bay.  The aroma of hemp from the backstays competes with the smell of tar from the rigging and the ocean's brine.  Just 'fore the poopdeck is the quarter boat, hanging from its arched white support arms.  Off the starboard rail, a small fishing boat tacks toward open sea, leaving the echo of a sea chantey drifting across the waves.  There is a group of halflings lounging on a raised platform in front of the ship's wheel."
