  "description": [
    "As the island comes to an end, the spit disappears into a line of stones.  They offer footing out into the lake a ways, a natural pier with no boats to dock.  Every now and then a small wave washes over them, making you think twice about heading too far out.  Who knows what manner of great reptilian beast might frequent this cavern?"
