    "[Ancient Passage]"

  "description": [
    "The passageway widens to the west, where rows of columns are visible to the north and south, supporting the ceiling as it rises dramatically.  Ornately carved balustrades bracket the processional route which continues westward toward a massive, golden sandstone altar raised high on a dais.  To the east, the walls and ceiling close in rapidly, the passage shrinking to enter a dimly lit tunnel."
