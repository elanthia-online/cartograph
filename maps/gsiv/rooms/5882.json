    "No graves surround the crossroads, only well-maintained grass.  A wood and iron bench sits in a small field of lush grass.  The iron portion of the bench is painted a glossy black.  The boards forming the seat and back of the bench are meticulously kept clean.  A rose bush grows on either side of the bench.  To the north, the path meanders up a low-rising hill.",
