    "A large building dominates the rest.  Though squat like most of the other buildings, the Great Hall is easily three times the size of any other.  Narrow windows, a reinforced door and a slate roof make the hall an admirable defensive structure, should that dire need occur.  Mostly it is just used for village gatherings and feasts."
