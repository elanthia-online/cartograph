  "description": [
    "Thick stone walls frame a wide, wooden gate.  A vaulted stone archway provides some cover from the weather, which is often inclement so close to the glaciers.  The packed earth pathway skirting the town's walls gives way to a cobbled street in the same dark grey stone as the lower half of the walls."
