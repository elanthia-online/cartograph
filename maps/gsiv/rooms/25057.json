  "description": [
    "Racks of full-faced hides lay caked beneath a mixture of dirt and gore, the pelts' glassy eyes glancing outwards along the perimeter of the camp.  The forehead of each mammal has been anointed with a black-inked symbol, the scent of incensed oil rubbed into the uncombed fur.  Positioned squarely behind the racks is a small marble altar, its surface marred and covered with sanguine streaks."
