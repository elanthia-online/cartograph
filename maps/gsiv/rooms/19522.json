    "Lush domestic and exotic floras thrive in the humidity of this greenhouse, their verdant forms outstanding against the fogged glass panes.  Vibrant blooms scent the moist air with their heady perfume, overwhelming the more subtle fragrance of the surrounding herb beds.  A simple stone path winds through the greenhouse, leading to a secluded area."
