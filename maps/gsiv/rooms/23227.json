    "Stone water nymphs seem to dance in a small pool fed by a miniature waterfall by the west wall.  Greenhouse-grown palm fronds frame the pool, resting on a thick carpet the color of grass.  A white iron bed and fan-backed rattan chairs blend into the scene, set beside a stone fireplace that is the only reminder of the chill temperatures beyond the walls of this cozy room."
