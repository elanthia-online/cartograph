    "A pearl-handled filigreed mandolin hangs on one of the glossy mistwood walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A brass flowerpot sits in one corner of a dappled celadon marble floor.  There is a gold-leafed mistwood cabinet on one side of the shop and a long mistwood counter on the other."
