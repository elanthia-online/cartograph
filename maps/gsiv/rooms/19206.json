    "Two large tapestries adorn the walls in this section of the shop, each depicting the same halfling in two completely different settings.  Beneath the tapestries rest a brick-lined granite tart kiln, its top covered with a sheet of mithril upon which rest several fresh-out-of-the-oven tarts.  You also see a large wicker bin with a hastily written sign on it."
