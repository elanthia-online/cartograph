    "[Charging Boar Room]"
  ],
  "description": [
    "Walls of dark granite paneled in polished pine encase this simple yet austere chamber.  A large tapestry depicting a charging boar hangs along one wall, opposite a roaring hearth.  The musky scent of burning wood clings to the air in the room, mixing with the musky scent of chrysanthemum petals rising from a bowl atop a small table.  An elegant bed of highly polished wood lies near the center of the room, its dark linen snugly tucked."
