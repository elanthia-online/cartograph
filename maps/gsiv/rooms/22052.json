    "Thick draperies of heavy green silk cover the window, shutting out the bustle and haste of Wehnimer's Landing.  The walls, papered with a cream colored brocade, are hung with paintings of local landscapes.  Dozens of sweetly scented candles grace the mantle and flicker merrily from wall sconces.  A delicate bedside table is pulled up close to a large fluffy featherbed."
