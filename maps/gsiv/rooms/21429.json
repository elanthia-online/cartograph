  "description": [
    "Long, slender lengths of split willow rise and bow inward to form the subtly peaked frame of this small hut, their arrangement particularly suited to for flexibility and durability.  Overlying the structure, bundles of rushes and leaves have been thatched together to form the exterior, and the materials lend a clean, green note to the air.  Perfect spheres of frosted glass dangle from cords of rope draped from the supports, emanating a warm light that falls over the wares and surroundings."
