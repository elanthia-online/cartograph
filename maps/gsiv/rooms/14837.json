    "A trail winds out of the soft shadows of the glade, widening as it heads to the northeast where tall poplars can be glimpsed in the night's murk.  Where the poplars begin, the track widens into a lane.  To the south and east, the trees of the glade stand silent and still, and the darkness beneath their canopy is pierced here and there by shafts of moonlight.",

To the south and east, the trees of the glade stand silent and still, and the light beneath their canopy is colored a gentle tone of green."
