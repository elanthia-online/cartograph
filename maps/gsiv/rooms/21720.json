    "Large sections of the northern and eastern walls of this uppermost room have long since fallen away, scattering rubble on the ground below.  Long, thick vines of ivy have worked their way inward through the missing sections and have started to spread along the western and southern walls.  A stone stairway leads downward through a hole in the warped rough plank flooring."
