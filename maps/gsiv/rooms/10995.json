    "Moonlight casts faint colored beams through a stained glass picture window set in the western wall and glints off the antique brass sextant set upon the marble-topped table below it.  The golden luster of the plank flooring is worn dull in a path between the headmaster's desk and a maoral-framed door.  A thick leather-bound ledger lies open and askew on the surface of the teak desk, and dark stains ring the inkpot and quill perched beside it.",
