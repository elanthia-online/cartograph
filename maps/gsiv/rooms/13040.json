    "Strategically placed blocks force shoppers into a circular motion as they examine the floor samples.  The pale-hued maple floor is freshly polished and not yet dulled in the high traffic areas.  The walls are painted a soft periwinkle and the ceiling above is a plain white, both enlivened by the sunlight coming through the windows on the southern wall.",
