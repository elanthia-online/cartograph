    "Bracketed by pines at either side, a sheer rock slope rises over the snowscape.  The slope is formed of a dark gray rock that is stained a rusty red in spots, and is encased entirely in ice.  Near its base, a dark cave opens into the mountain, its mouth a shadowy maw that stands in stark contrast to the snowy hillside around it."
