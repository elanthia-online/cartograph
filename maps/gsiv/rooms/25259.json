    "A half-circle altar of black ora rests before the windowed eastern wall.  Stray bands of sunlight steep the metal in a burnished golden glow.  Upon the altar rests a half-dozen yellowed eggs, each the size of a giantman's fist, cracked open to reveal bits of moulted cuticula inside.  High overhead, a turquoise-beaded black tapestry is jaggedly torn in half, the tattered remnants softly flapping like the wings of a great vesperti."
