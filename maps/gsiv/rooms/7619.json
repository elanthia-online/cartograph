    "This stretch of beach is a patch of dirty whitish sand, stuck in between the craggy grey rocks to the east and the smooth black sands to the west.  It's as though the two surrounding areas didn't quite meet, and the Lords of Liabo had to put something in here, but didn't give it much thought.  You can see a tumbledown dock stretching out into the bay to the east, pointing north into the water like an arthritic finger."
