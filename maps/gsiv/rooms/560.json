    "A thick stand of rushes guards a forbidding wall of trees with foliage so dark it looks black.  The rushes are both thick and tall.  They stand their sentry, hoisting an armament of brown cattails over them, which wave slowly at the touch of the breeze.  A multitude of frogs croak loudly in the darkness, unseen but filling the night with their song.",
