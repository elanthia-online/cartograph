  "description": [
    "Wheat fields, their golden tassels waving gently in the soft wind, spread out to the northwest.  To the southwest, rows of turnip plants extend their green shoots toward the sunlight, and near the turnip patch two fenced pens sit with open gates.  Directly eastward, the wide, sturdy side of a well-built barn rises into the air.  Weeds cluster against the barn's side and spread out toward the fields, though foot traffic has cleared the weeds from paths in four directions."
