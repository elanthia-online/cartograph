    "A restful quiet hangs over this part of the world, as if none of the strifes or worries of Elanthia have found this little corner of the continent.  The gentle breeze that touches your skin with a cool caress and the pleasing fragrance of blooming wildflowers makes this little valley almost idyllic."
