    "The thick stone blocks that comprise the walls and floor of the cell stifle the surrounding din of the area, their surfaces covered in blackened moss and a variety of decaying vines.  Rusted iron shelves and racks are haphazardly placed on each side of an unhinged door toward the back of the room, the center decorated by a circle of dimly lit candles bleeding wax through the cracks in the rock."
