    "A wide haon counter bisects this portico.  Standing near the gap in the length of the counter, a tall elf with weathered features and broad shoulders looks ready to assist those wishing to purchase items from the inventory displayed beneath the counter's glaes top, or to collect silvers from aspiring weaponsmiths wishing to use one of the numerous workshops joined to the portico by paved walkways."
