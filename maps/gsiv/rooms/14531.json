    "The stone-lined path follows a narrow, crystal clear stream as it flows over dark, river-worn stones.  Birds of all varieties congregate on the sandy banks, bathing themselves in shallow pools.  Flying free overhead, the feathered creatures soar through the dense cover provided by groves of thickly planted rainforest trees."
