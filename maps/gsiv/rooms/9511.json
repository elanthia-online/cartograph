    "The intersection of three tunnels forms a rough Y-shape.  Judging from the condition of the floor and the coloration of the supporting timbers, the tunnels to the northwest and south appear to be older than the tunnel to the southeast.  The steel rails also follow the northwest and south tunnels, crossing over the entrance to the southeast tunnel.  A single amber toadstool in a stone pot casts a baleful light across the tunnels' convergence."
