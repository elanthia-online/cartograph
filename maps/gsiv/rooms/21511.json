    "Small glass lanterns hang precariously from buffed brass hooks, designed to provide enough light to examine wares carefully.  Wall panels painted a willow green hue complement the panels of rustic oak flooring, and a short glass-topped counter dominates the rear of the wagon.  Shelves of applewood and cherrywood are strategically dotted about the walls."
