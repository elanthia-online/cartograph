  "description": [
    "About half the size of the front room, this space is obviously a workroom.  A long oak table against the back wall is strewn with a variety of half-finished projects.  A dim globe of luminescence on the ceiling illuminates the space, shedding light on the rough wooden walls and bare boards of the floor.  A doorway leads out, while a white-washed sign is the only other furniture in the room."
