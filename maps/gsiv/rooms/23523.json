    "Narrow stained glass windows pierce soaring despanal-veined alabaster walls in this expansive hall.  Each window's colorful design casts its own pattern on the barrel-vaulted ceiling to create a complex, kaleidoscopic play of light.  On the east side of the hall, an ebonwood lectern stands at the center of a small stage.  Art-lined alcoves around the room create conversation spaces while leaving a central expanse of inlaid stone open for dancing or large gatherings."
