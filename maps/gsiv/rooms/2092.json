    "The trees at the edge of the forest are singed, but still living.  Though their limbs were blackened by the fire, tiny shoots lend a sense of rejuvenation to these otherwise dreary surroundings.  Peering further into the woods, you can see that the swath of destruction cut by the flames was mercifully stopped just south of here, leaving vast numbers of trees unharmed.",
