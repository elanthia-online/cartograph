  "description": [
    "Crimson and golden tesserae wink from the curved walls of the hallway, echoing the vivid hues of the lush runners carpeting the walk.  Lit by sullen torchlight, a tall an elven soldier statue at the hallway's end lifts its blade in a tireless salute.  Panes of stained glass in fiery hues blaze to either side of the entrance of a recruitment office, its fanfare a stark contrast to the plain entrance of the opposing armory."
