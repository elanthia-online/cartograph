    "The narrow tunnel winds through the solid glaes into gloom, its circuitous route leaving visibility at almost nil.  Heavy with the thick, sulfurous stink of molten lava, the air is stifling and still.  The vision of a river of the stuff pouring through these tunnels like fire down a drake's gullet is too plausible to be easily disregarded."
