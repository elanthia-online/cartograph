    "Standing about seven feet tall, the tops of the four wrought iron torches burn ferociously, emitting a thick black smoke.  Seven stone benches fill the cobblestone patio, each grouped with a small round table.  Manicured hawthorn bushes line the rounded area, providing a bit of privacy and quietude from the traffic of the plaza.",

Manicured hawthorn bushes line the rounded area, providing a bit of privacy from the traffic of the plaza.  Overhead, the sound of insects and birds drown out any sense of quietude the hedge would have otherwise offered."
