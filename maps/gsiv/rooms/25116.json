  "description": [
    "Lining the walls are several doorless chambers filled with cartons and crates of all shapes and sizes.  A row of wheeled serving carts lined up along one wall are immaculately clean.  Starting from the floor, a thin oak banister rises up and ascends the wall heading deeper into the wing.  The plush crimson carpet stops abruptly here, knotted and burled wooden planks continue onward."
