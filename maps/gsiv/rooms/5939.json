    "Hundreds of flies and maggots swarm over the remains of a massive creature, which lies partially buried in the center of this room.  The crumbling ceiling above has created massive piles of rocks in various sizes along the ground, forcing you to inch along the jagged walls of the room.  Sudden drops in the floor make walking quite deadly."
