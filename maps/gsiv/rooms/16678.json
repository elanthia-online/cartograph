    "Beneath a black marble-tiled ceiling with a few cobwebs in the corners, an ancient buried treasure map with a bold X marked in the lower left corner hangs on one of the mica-flecked black marble walls.  A jam-stained locked oak box with tiny chocolate fingerprints and a locked cherrywood chest etched with sylvan runes sit in opposite corners while a bookcase with various tomes and scrolls stuffed on the shelves rests on a black and white checkered marble tile floor."
