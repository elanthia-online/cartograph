    "Lining the walls are racks and stands with well-organized arrays of weapons and armor upon them.  Resting beside a well-used vice and an oaken worktable, a barrel of weapon oil stands in one corner of the room.  The room is dimly lit, its only source of light coming from an oil lamp in the far corner of the room.  Set into the southernmost wall next to a large locker is a small shelf."
