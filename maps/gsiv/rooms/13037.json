    "A tall wooden palisade is formed of living trees planted so closely together, their trunks touch and their leafy crowns intertwine.  The wall extends quite a ways to either side save for one spot, where there is a gap several feet wide.  Branches meet and interlace over the opening, forming a natural, leaf-covered arch."
