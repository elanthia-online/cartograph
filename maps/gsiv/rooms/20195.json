  "description": [
    "The scent of leather pervades this room, mixed with lantern oil, and a faint flowery scent.  A darkly stained oak crate crammed with goods rests on the floor near the front, while a small cherry oak dresser with open drawers stands against the wall to one side, below an etched metal sign.  The area is lit with several flickering lanterns set along the rustic log walls, between two of which, a row of hooks displays more wares to be sold.  At the back of the wagon, a small archway affords further entrance, while opposite, an open doorway housing a set of steps leads back outside."
