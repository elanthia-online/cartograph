    "The oversized limb separates from the smaller branches around it, extending outwards and on its own past the bulk of the banyan's canopy.  Without other offshoots to anchor to, the walls of rope netting end, replaced by rough-hewn railings of moldering wood.  A detritus of fallen leaves coats the flat walking surface in a slick of vegetal decay."
