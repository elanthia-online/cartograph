    "The slope of the bridge runs downward towards the city gate, its polished limestone cobbles gleaming softly in the light.  Glittering ruby-hued pennants edged in golden thread flutter atop the massive city walls.  Several city guardsmen stand along the bridge's thick limestone walls, casually inspecting the passersby as they enter and exit the city."
