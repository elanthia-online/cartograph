    "Whoo, whoo whoo, whooo, wooo-whooo!  The booming, and unmistably loud voice of an owl fills the night.  In the distance a reply can be heard, carried on the air.  The elms in this area provide a perch from which the owls can survey what appears to be a prime feeding ground.  A rustling near some low brush is followed by the heavy flapping of wings.  The screech of a small animal is cut short and silence fills the night air.",
    "Ratta-tatta-tatta-tat!  A woodpecker's drilling echoes through the forest.  Several other woodpeckers pick up the sound, and soon the woods are filled with the staccato hammerings of woodpeckers looking for a meal.  The elms in this area appear to be prime feeding grounds.  Many have leaves that are mostly yellow or missing entirely, and their branches droop as if something, perhaps a borer or other insect, is attacking them."
