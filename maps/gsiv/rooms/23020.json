  "description": [
    "Vibrant, purple-headed swamp thistle creates an extravagant splash of color as it grows in tangle masses along the northeastern edge of the swamp.  Lance-headed spurs drive outward from the knotted bushes and pierce the leaves of a moon vine that has attempted to wed its fate to the dark, flowering bush.  A thickly corded spider web is built against the prickled stems of the species and is littered with dried-out insect carcasses."
