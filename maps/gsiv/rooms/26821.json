    "Rows of bookshelves enclose this cozy hideaway, gleaming in the light of the brass torch sconces that are affixed to the walls.  Plush chairs sit off in one corner while cushions lie scattered about the floor, offering comfort to those wishing to thumb through the many tomes.  An arched bay window frames a plush padded window seat on the far wall, providing a bird's eye view of the snowy environs below."
