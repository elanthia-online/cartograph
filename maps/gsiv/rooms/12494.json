    "A tremendous copper drum juts from the floor at the room's center, tapering to a rounded peak near the ceiling to form a massive brandy still which takes up nearly the entire room.  From atop, a thin metal tube descends in tight coils and disappears into a smaller barrel to one side.  Beads of condensation collect at the end of a thin spout protruding from the barrel's front, pause for one tense second, and then drop lightly into a clear glass jug."
