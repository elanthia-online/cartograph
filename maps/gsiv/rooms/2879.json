    "A large spruce tree has taken root here, its thick branches pressing outwards against the other trees.  Beneath it, yellowed grass struggles up through the carpet of fallen needles and snow.  Small circles indent the snow, footprints left by the passing of a small animal.  To the west, a thin mist can be seen creeping through the forest."
