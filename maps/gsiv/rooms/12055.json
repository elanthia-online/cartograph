    "A stand of waxy-leafed bushes pokes above the tall meadow grass.  Movement in the branches seems to indicate the presence of one or more small occupants.  Exposed bush roots extend through the grass and out over a bare spot of ground where a slab of stone, only partially buried in the soil, prevents vegetation from taking root."
