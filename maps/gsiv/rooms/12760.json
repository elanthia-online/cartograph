    "The arched doorway along the wall has been blocked off with heavy stone slabs, preventing access to the northern portion of the hall.  The odor of the sea grows stronger here, despite the lack of windows.  Darkness stretches onward, as well as back, and is disturbed only by the occasional drip of water from the ceiling."
