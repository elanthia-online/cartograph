  "description": [
    "The edge of the bluff and the river beneath it cut back to the south, providing the buried dead a serene overlook of the bay beyond the island of River's Rest and the wide flowing south fork of the Tempest River.  Sunken graves dot the area, occasionally spotted with a wood marker, and interspersed with marble and riverstone crypts of varying size and ornateness.  A ring of small willows grows in the center of the graves around a patch of emerald green grass."
