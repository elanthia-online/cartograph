    "A large golden fire provides light for this armory, and each wall is covered with weapons and armor, the variety of which you've never seen before.  On the nearest wall hangs an immense claidhmore, slightly bloodstained and inscribed with the word \"Deathbringer\".  Below it stands a small shrine and offering plate dedicated to the war god Kai."
