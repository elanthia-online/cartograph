    "The trussed ceiling of this infirmary chamber hangs low, its granite tiled floor lined with rows of soft downy beds, spaced for easy maneuvering between their ranks.  Alcoves rest in the walls between the rows, each hosting medicines, bandages, medical instruments, and a cabinet.  Beside each bed rests a simple stone wash basin and short wooden stool.  Lit by cresset-cast sconces anchored into the stone walls, the chamber provides a solemn, but gentle respite."
