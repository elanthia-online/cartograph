    "A series of freshly whitewashed planks form a steep stairway connecting the far end of the pine walkway to a sturdy and spacious dock jutting out across a deep inlet at the river's edge.  Swirls and eddies in the current below indicate a somewhat greater depth to the river at this point than that found farther away from the main channel.  A luminous moon, high overhead, casts soft reflections of shimmering gold flecks across the rippling surface."
