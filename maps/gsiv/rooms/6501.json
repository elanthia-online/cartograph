  "description": [
    "The four exits leading out of this circular chamber are evenly spaced around the wall.  Each exit is identical except for the grotesque faces that have been carved into the stone above the exits.  The faces all appear to be human, but each has been twisted into a travesty of emotional expression.  The face to the north appears to be smiling or grinning, to the east is the face of one in great pain, to the south is an image of great shock or surprise, and the image to the west appears to be crying."
