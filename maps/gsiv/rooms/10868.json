    "This quiet lane is lined with fragrant old persimmon trees.  On either side of the lane, set back behind the trees, are a pair of frond-roofed, stucco bungalows...one behind a brass-knobbed gate, the other through a graceful arch.  To the west, rising above the nearby treetops, is a blue-domed pavilion.  Fireflies flitter among the trees.",
