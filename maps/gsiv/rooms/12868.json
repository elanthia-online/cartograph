  "description": [
    "The southwestern section of the fence is marred with splintered rails and a large gap, but there is no sign of its missing portion.  Tiny rodent skeletons rest at the base of an oak tree that towers above, directly beneath a clearly visible, partially tattered nest in one of its many bare branches.  A river winds almost diagonally to the town here, a small loading dock jutting into its turbulent midst."
