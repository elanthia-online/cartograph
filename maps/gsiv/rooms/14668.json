    "Mother-of-pearl paths converge here in a large circle.  The stones glow softly, evidence of the magic needed to work such into uniform cobbles.  Simple benches of black marble line the circle.  In its center, a polished obelisk of silver-veined black marble reaches toward the sky.  The air is thick with sweet floral scents."
