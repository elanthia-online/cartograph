    "Shadows huddle into dense pools within the recesses of the corridor, growing thicker as the hallway snakes to the southwest.  Within their darkness, a dense covering of contorted runes is visible, skittering across the walls like a spidery army.  No breezes intrude here, as if the air current is reluctant to pass the runic display."
