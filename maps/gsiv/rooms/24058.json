    "Bookcases, ornate tapestries, and paintings spread across the walls depict the history of the House of Paupers and the races of Elanthia, along with a row of high-hanging glaes orbs serving as the source of lighting.  A pair of small wooden footstools is tucked between the bookcases, and a pair of worn leather wingback chairs rests against the wall opposite the archway leading out of the room, next to which is a small granite bar.  A large rosewood desk envelops an entire corner of the library near a shadowy bookcase."
