    "The trail widens as it passes a brackish pool.  The small clearing permits the shallowest hint of a cooling breeze, just enough to reduce the constant hum of gnats and mosquitoes.  The thin, errant breeze stirs up the primal stink of rotting plants and rich, diluvial mud.  A small hummock rises out of the cattails to the south."
