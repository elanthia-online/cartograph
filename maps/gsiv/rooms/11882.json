    "Thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of gossamer webs spread across the upper walls and ceiling of this portion of the tunnel.  The tiny webs collect the dampness and shine as a galaxy of faint green nebulae in the emerald light from the moving stream.  In each web a tiny spider holds sway, crouching at the center and ferociously guarding its territory.  It is impossible to determine what these spiders feed on, though, as no flying or crawling insect-life is evident."
