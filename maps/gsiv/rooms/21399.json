    "Crowding this small space are stacks of grimy crates and barrels that emanate an overwhelming odor of alcohol into the room.  Hidden among the crates sits a lustrous black leather couch, an obvious new addition based on the lack of dust.  A thick burgundy velvet curtain provides the only egress into the barroom."
