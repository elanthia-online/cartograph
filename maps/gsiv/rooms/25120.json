    "On either side of an iron-bound door are wide, gold-trimmed banners cut from heavy silk and bearing the emblem of Reim.  The ceiling rises at a steep pitch from each wall, creating a center point for a massive ethereal chandelier suspended overhead.  The carpet covering the floor is bright crimson edged with elaborate gold stitchwork that continues througout the wing."
