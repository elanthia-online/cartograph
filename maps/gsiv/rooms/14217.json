  "description": [
    "The path is lined with solid, white stepping stones that stand in vivid contrast against the verdant green carpet of grass.  Thick clusters of flowering trumpet vines reach toward the skies as they cling to the high stone wall that surrounds the gardens.  Beneath a copse of shade trees, a circular gazebo stands with fluted white marble columns and a glistening gold tiled roof, providing a quiet niche for prayer and contemplation."
