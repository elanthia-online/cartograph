    "Some of the ice here is a bit choppy, and long streaks and circles show where people have practiced tricky turns in their skates.  The air is crisp and clean, but kept at a moderate temperature by the stoves on the balcony above.  The sound of organ music drifts in from somewhere nearby, lending background noise to the ambiance."
