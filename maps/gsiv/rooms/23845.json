    "An open window takes up the majority of the back wall, allowing ample moonlight as well as errant breezes to enter the room.  At opposing corners of the opening, a deep brawling bin and a ranged weapons crate rest against the amethyst silk wall.  In the center of the floor, an edged weapons rack displays additional wares, while a hanging wooden sign resides above.  Opposite the window, a silver-beaded curtain hangs in a doorway, the tiny silver orbs clicking together when disturbed by the wind.",
