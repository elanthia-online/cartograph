    "This room serves as a meeting place for when the entire membership is addressed.  The ceiling arches above you to the full two-story height of the Guild Hall, and the dangling candled chandeliers offer sufficient lighting.  Rows of spartan pews stand in neat ranks, with a carpeted aisle between.  At the north end sits a studious podium atop the dais.  A stained glass window depicting the Guild's coat of arms covers the full height of the southern wall and casts a ruddy hue upon the many fixtures."
