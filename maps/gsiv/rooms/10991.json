    "A rustic chandelier crafted from an old ship's wheel casts a ruddy glow across a polished maoral floor inlaid with a detailed pattern in knotted pale oak.  Weapon racks and full suits of armor guard archways leading off the entry foyer, and a plush green runner softens a grand staircase leading to the second floor."
