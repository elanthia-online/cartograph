    "Interrupting the riverstone path is a plain dirt practice ring surrounded by weathered posts.  Benches and water troughs are set upon the perimeter, which is interrupted at the northern point by a set of steps leading to a small porch.  Pole torches, unlit and quiescent, are set at even intervals between the sparse furnishings, while a slender silver triangle clangs melodically against the porches support post.",

Pole torches burn brightly from where they are set between the sparse furnishings, and offer cheerful illumination to the area."
