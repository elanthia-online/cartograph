    "Water seeps through the tunnel, slowly dripping down the walls and into a grate placed to pick up the extra runoff.  A dark green trail marks the route the water takes on the way down, several kinds of moss and lichen thriving in the moist environment.  A large overhang protects mining equipment stored for future use at the end of the cavern."
