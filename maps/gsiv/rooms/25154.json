  "description": [
    "The sandstone landscape breaks abruptly, yielding to a small, sparse garden of sculptural stones.   The statuesque rocks display a striking tonal array, ranging from fiery copper to dark bronze and rich sanguine to clay red.  A few sparse wisps of cultivated greenery trail from earthenware planters set beneath a trio of arched stained glass windows."
