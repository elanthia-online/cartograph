  "description": [
    "A small clearing is ringed with large boulders, their backs on the west guarded by a tall bluff.  Trees stand on the outside perimeter, as though trying to look over the shoulders of the giants.  In the center of the clearing is a small pool, ringed with small rocks of the same stone as their massive counterparts.  The clearing has an otherworldly feel, sheltered as it is from the gales."
