    "To one side of this sandy path is a forest and to the other the seemingly endless bramble thicket that only the foolhardy would dare to travel.  Shifting with each footstep that touches it, the path shimmers in the moonlight, constantly changing - always the same.  Swiftly moving water is heard to the east and north, although the source is not yet visible to the eye.",
