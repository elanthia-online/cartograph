  "description": [
    "The warm, sweet aroma of baking bread and delicate pastries wafts through the quaint bakeshop, inviting browsers to partake in the enticing goods sold here.  Shimmering sunlight filters through a pair of wood-framed windows, and a pair of decorative brass sconces hold glowing candles that help to illuminate a counter crafted from highly polished birch.  An open archway behind the counter leads to a partially obscured backroom, from which a mixture of sugary smells emanates."
