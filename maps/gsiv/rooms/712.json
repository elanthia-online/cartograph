    "A lone stonework building rests against the high city wall, its blue tile roof barely visible for the trees surrounding the structure.  A double track indicating frequent wagon traffic leads from the cobblestoned wey towards a pair of wide double doors in the building's left side wall.  A small metal grate is set into the bottom of the thick city wall behind the building."
