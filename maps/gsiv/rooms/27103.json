    "Choked by the broken pieces of floating grass meadows pushed downstream from the north, the river narrows considerably and begins a gradual path to the southeast.  A cluster of grass flowers, their spindly stems twisting and turning in the slight breeze, flutter about the area as they are carried downstream."
