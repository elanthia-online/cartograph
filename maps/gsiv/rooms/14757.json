    "A simple fauna tapestry hangs on one of the white-washed ash walls, and a white painted ceiling rises overhead.  A bird of paradise-filled vase sits in one corner of a terra cotta clay tile floor.  There is a large white wicker counter on one side of the shop and an open-front willow display case on the other."
