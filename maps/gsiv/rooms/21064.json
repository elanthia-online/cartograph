    "Widening perceptively to the south, the river flows at a steady pace to its destination in the north.  Rough muddy banks rise from the edge of the water course and are choked with verdant vines.  Several tendrils dangle from the trees above to create a colorful curtain that is laden with fragrant white jasmines.  The rise and fall of frogs chirping is punctuated by the steady hum of insects throughout the area."
