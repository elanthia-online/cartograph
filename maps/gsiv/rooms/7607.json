  "description": [
    "One huge chunk of rock has settled here, giving a surface as smooth as a paved road.  Even the ubiquitous crabs seem absent here, despite a slight slope running down into the water, where the surf washes it smooth and slick.  Bits of broken shell litter the otherwise smooth ground as it seems the local birds have oft used this as a place to drop shellfish from a height, to break them open and feast."
