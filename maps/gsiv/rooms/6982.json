  "description": [
    "A wide ledge extends along the wall of the canyon here, a few feet above the water's surface, meeting the stairway carved in the rock above you which leads to the rim of the gorge.  The canyon curves noticeably to the south, preventing you from seeing what lies upstream.  The high, steep walls keep most of the gorge in shadow, and echo hollowly with the trickle of water flowing in the once mighty river."
