    "This sturdy wooden stand has been spruced up after several years of neglect.  Braided woolen throw rugs dot the well-swept floors, and a fresh coat of bright blue paint covers the walls.  The room itself is cluttered with a wide variety of tables, display cases, and other containers each bursting with odds and ends for sale.  A few light drafts of bitingly cold air enter through some holes spaced randomly about the floorboards."
