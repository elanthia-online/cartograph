  "description": [
    "Three smoky brass oil lamps, mounted on the bulkheads, hazily illuminate this cramped cabin.  A counter extends from one wall, turns at a right angle, and connects to another wall, barring passage and allowing only a small area in which to stand.  Behind the counter a young halfling leans over a spinning wheel, intently polishing the tips on a glittering glass circlet.  A far table contains a fire-making mechanism of some sort, lit, and a rack on the wall holds several long pipes."
