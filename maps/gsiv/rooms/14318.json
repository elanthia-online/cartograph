  "description": [
    "A curtain of hanging meats guards the opening of the pantry, their gamey smell overwhelming this small space.  Racks of shelves are filled with delicacies and food stuffs infrequently used and requiring a measure of protection from the extreme heat of the kitchen.  A small arc mars a section of the wooden floor as though something has been repeatedly swiveled, wearing a tiny groove into the boards."
