    "The room is sparsely furnished, although it is as large as a storage room.  A trestle table sits in the southwest corner under a pale, glowing orb.  A few dust-ridden crates, all open and empty, line the northern wall.  The floor near the crates is badly scratched.  A faint whisper of a breeze carries a hint of the dank smell of mold."
