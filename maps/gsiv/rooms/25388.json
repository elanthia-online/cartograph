  "description": [
    "Three small wood-framed beds, each draped with a red and black plaid blanket, are lined up neatly against the far wall.  Blue cotton curtains, slightly frayed at the hems, flutter occasionally with errant breezes wafting through an open window.  A fuzzy stuffed panther protrudes from an open toy chest, set upon one corner of a tartan plaid carpet."
