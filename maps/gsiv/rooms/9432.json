    "A steady stream of dwarves passes along through the tunnel to the northwest, busily going about their day.  Several small shops fitted with brightly painted shutters stand nearby, taking advantage of the heavy foot traffic.  The scent of rich loam wafts from one particular storefront lined with numerous potted luminescent toadstools."
