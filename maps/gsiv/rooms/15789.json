    "The back room is filled with carryalls of all sizes hanging from a variety of hooks and racks.  Flashfeet has used some regional materials for the making of many and put them on display by the dressing room.",
    "The floor is completely covered with an assortment of animal furs, each layered on top of the next like the scales of a snake.  A series of hooks and racks are affixed around the room, displaying assorted totes and carryalls. A wide fieldstone fireplace sits in the back of the room with a basket of sticks next to it.",
    "Dark, rich, wooden floors contrast the jewel-toned tiles adorning the walls, reflecting a myriad of colors.  Centered on each tile is a metal rod bearing all manner of satchels and sacks.  Spaced evenly throughout the room, dark wooden tables have been neatly stacked with assorted pouches, cases, and kits.  A jovial giantman clerk tends to a wide fieldstone fireplace along the back wall next to a basket of sticks."
