  "description": [
    "The figure of a woman has been carved into the living bark of one of the trees.  The woman's shape is long and thin, her face lined and haggard.  The bark of other trees has also been carved with symbols, letters and different shapes.  Thick sap flows slowly from the carvings, making them appear to be weeping."
