    "Towering above the courtyard is a massive conifer, its branches spread wide to cast shadows over a pair of small stained oak tables surrounded by matching chairs.  Carved stone steps meld fluidly with the slate walkway as they wind their way through the courtyard to the polished ebony double doors set into the face of a simple, yet elegant manor.  Moonbeams dance off of the twisted mithril bars that form the high fence which extends around the courtyard.",
