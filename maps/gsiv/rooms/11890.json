    "Only a stray bit of emerald light from the southeast intrudes upon the darkness of this silt-filled room.  The clay silt is wet and heavy, defying attempts to move through it or remove it, and it has piled high against the northwest wall.  The outline of the top of a door is just discernible through the gloom, but the volume of sucking, cloying silt keeps away any who would wish to examine it more closely."
