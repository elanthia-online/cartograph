    "The warm golden lacquered wood of the walls fades away into a dull, muted grey in this small chamber.  Orbs of the same drab color are set into runic patterns upon the floor, their crystalline surfaces glinting softly in the flickering light.  A statue of a man to the northwest stares quietly into the distance, as if gazing at something only he could see.  Set before the statue is a dark stone altar, its edges delicately carved and embellished, adding a tiny hint of beauty to the somber surroundings."
