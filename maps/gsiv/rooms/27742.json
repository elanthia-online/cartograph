  "description": [
    "Immediately beneath the wall to the east runs the narrow confines of Brewer's Alley, and a number of carters and brewer's apprentices run its cobbles night and day.  A few citizens and adventurers wander out of its shops at all hours as well, seeking bargains or the odd rare artifact.  In the distance, Barley Lane runs east toward an abandoned well."
