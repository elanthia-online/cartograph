  "description": [
    "The end of the limb, and the end of the line, is marked with a rough-hewn railing.  It's shape recalls a finer and foreign balcony, though its materials are base and local.  A single lit lantern hangs over the edge, illuminating a small, fractional circle of the vast blackness of open space that surrounds the tree."
