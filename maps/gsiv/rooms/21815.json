    "The road here has suffered the unmerciful wrath of nature over the years.  Recent travel has cleared a more narrow path through the center of the lane, but a great deal of foliage and weeds have flourished along both sides of the trail.  Off to the northwest, you see an expansive war-torn battlefield."
