    "This room is oblong and spacious.  Below a gilt-framed detailed painting, a stone and oak fireplace dominates the north wall, providing warmth to the living quarters.  Overfilled bookcases line the western wall, and a few tables and chairs occupy the floor nearby.  Neatly arranged bunk beds form two rows along the northern wall, each with a heavy foot locker at the end, providing storage for those who reside here."
