    "A dank smell of ancient mold fills the still air, much of it emanating from an area in the corner of the tunnel where the ceiling has partially collapsed into a pile of long-untouched rubble.  Half-crushed skeletons lie scattered around the sharp turn in the tunnel, and a few odd bones protrude from the pile of fallen stone."
