    "A vast and peaceful courtyard surrounds the crystal tower, bordered by a stone wall.  Delicate vines coated with a fine layer of ice cling to the wall, creating a frozen mosaic.  Almost hidden by the vines, a staircase spirals upwards against the central tower, while a massive white modwir-framed entryway stands as the obvious entrance.",
