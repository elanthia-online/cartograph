  "description": [
    "At the bow of this mid-sized ship, stacks of debris are not so high as to impede view of the actual horizon, but are still an impressive collection of junk otherwise.  A large tangled net hangs from the foremast that drapes over the bow, strewn with old bones, empty painting frames, and other unusual objects.  Some salt-crusted barrels fill the space along the bow with a collection of random discarded detritus.  Behind a headless masthead, which is also missing a left arm, a hatch leads down below the crowded deck."
