  "description": [
    "A small shrine is set between a gap in the neatly-ordered rows of tanik trees planted along the walls.  The building is somewhat squat compared to its counterpart to the west, but has obviously been well-crafted.  A square arch of solid iron connects the door of the same metal to the highly polished granite walls, and the domed roof is coated with a finish of gleaming gold.  Two statues of dwarves holding crossed axes flank the entryway into the building."
