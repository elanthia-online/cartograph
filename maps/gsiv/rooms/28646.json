    "Shelves of black and dark purple tomes stretch from floor to ceiling, the spines of the books etched with spidery runes.  An immense desk of black wood rests at the end of the room, inlaid with silver runic symbols.  Scrolls and parchments are stacked neatly on the desk, next to a raven's quill and inkpot.  Behind the desk is a case of obsidian and clear glaes, full of various magical relics kept safely locked away.  In the center of the floor is a large scorched circle, blasted by some powerful force."
