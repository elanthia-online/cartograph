    "In the center of the room is a completely enclosed glass aquarium attached to a large, round vivarium.  The tank water is murky, the shallow water covering a muddy base.  The ground-covered portion of the enclosure is swampy and populated by numerous water-loving grasses.  A few coils of a huge anaconda can be seen along the sides of the glass, the rest of the creature obscured by the darkness."
