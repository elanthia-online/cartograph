    "This large, airy room is illuminated by a massive chandelier.  Above a wainscoting of green ceramic tiles, the circular stucco walls are decorated with fantastical images of peacocks, parrots, and ostriches parading through elaborate gardens.  The floor is covered with diamond-shaped slabs of slate arranged in an alternating pattern of dark grey and black.  Overhead, a dozen overlapping arches create a domed ceiling."
