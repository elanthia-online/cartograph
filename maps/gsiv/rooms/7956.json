  "description": [
    "This seems to be the main area of the burrow.  The massive roots of a giant tree grow down through the wide room and into the floor, creating something of a maze.  The dirt you walk on is scuffled by many feet, and the roots of the tree are nicked, scraped, and even bitten.  Several tunnels branch off through the roots, leading to various chambers."
