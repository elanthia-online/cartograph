    "The path veers northward, and off to the side at the heart of the fork is a simple, but skillfully built sign edged in scrollwork and supported by a pair of painted wooden posts.  Tall tufts of grass and flowering weeds have grown up at the base of the posts, and a large beribboned and flowered wreath hangs from the lower edge of the sign."
