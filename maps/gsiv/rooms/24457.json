    "Lengths of icy blue velvet are hung from iron bars fastened to the ceiling.  A low standing table rests atop a plush black carpet that fills the lounge.  Nestled into the corner is an angled armoire, its drawers pulled out and filled with refreshments.  Dim candelabras line the walls, each connected to the next by a thin gold chain.  Positioned on either side of the table are a large leather sofa and a large pillow-topped couch."
