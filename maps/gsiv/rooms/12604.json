    "Wide overhanging stalactites shelter this quiet spot.  Thick moss grows heartily along the walls and ceiling.  A damp breeze blows through, as soothing as the gale outside is unwholesome, and every now and then a drop of crystal clear water falls from a tuft of moss into a perfectly round natural basin in the floor.  The smooth surface of the little pool ripples for only a moment, and then returns to a calming stillness."
