    "Casting shadows high onto the walls of this ominous chamber, immense dark blue flames rise up from a griffin-shaped deep fueled gully.  A black mithril circular table with an elaborately hand-painted white war griffin rests on a raised platform in the center of this raging fire.  Just out of reach of the swirling flames, twelve high back stone chairs have been lightly scorched over time.  An elongated black tapestry ripples from the heat waves cast recklessly across the room."
