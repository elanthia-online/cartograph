  "description": [
    "Tucked away in a remote corner, this table is actually supported on one side by the wall it leans against.  The table top appears to be the side of a wrecked dinghy, and its legs are simply a few warped pieces of driftwood.  The whole thing is sun-bleached to such an extreme that it almost seems to have been whitewashed."
