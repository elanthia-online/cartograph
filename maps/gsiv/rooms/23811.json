    "The walls of this perfectly square room are painted a pale fawn hue and bisected by a strip of pristine white molding.  Decorative yet functional brass sconces hang in the center of each, casting a warm glow over a pair of mannequins that stand on either side of a tall oak cabinet.  A deep gold velvet curtain on the opposite wall leads to the store room."
