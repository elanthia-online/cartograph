    "Along this mud trail rests a deep, narrow creek.  Pale moonlight shows tiny footprints in the mud near the edge of the water.  A huge, frog-shaped, moss-covered boulder lies close to the border of the creek.  As the rushing current spirals downward, it passes over the boulder, causing water to splash onto the road.",
