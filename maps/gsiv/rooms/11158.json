    "The grass nearly reaches your knees and the old walkway is only identifiable as a line of short grass, heading north.  You get a glimpse of something through the wisps of mist to the north, but can't get a clear enough look to tell what it is.  To the southeast, the grass gets crowded out by two huge bushy hedges flanking the walkway."
