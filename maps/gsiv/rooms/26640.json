    "Tiny and cluttered, the small space is almost filled by a long wooden bench set into the wall with a small parchment sign nailed above.  Unopened crates in a wide variety of shapes and sizes are stacked about.  A single lantern is suspended from the ceiling, its copper frame and crystal panes kept pristine."
