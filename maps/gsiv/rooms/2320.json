    "This area seems well-travelled.  Priests in blue robes wander up and down a staircase carved from the glacier, and the ice you walk on is rough enough to stand on without falling.  A few small cottages have been built from the ice, and one seems to have been encased in it, with holes drilled out for the door and windows."
