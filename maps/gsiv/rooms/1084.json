    "Someone has etched something into the basalt rock.  A large, very distinct arrow points northward, and underneath a single word has been written.  A second arrow, somewhat less distinct and much smaller than the first, points toward the interior.  Whatever was written below it has been obliterated, although all around the arrow dance crudely drawn images of strange figures, six-armed animals and a single, huge gem."
