    "Upon smooth, polished limestone walls hang beautifully illuminated prayer scrolls encased in glass.  A varnished ebonwood desk basks in the reddish glow from the window directly behind it.  Thick leather-bound tomes line the shelves of a stout iron-wrought shelf in the corner, topped off by a slightly tarnished brass reliquary."
