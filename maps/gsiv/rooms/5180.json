  "description": [
    "The waters of the lagoon rush over the edge of the cliff face here, falling hundreds of feet to the beach far below.  Standing here on the edge of the cliff face, the black beach stretches out below for great distances to the north and south.  The falls form a small delta on the beach below, which is crossed by a weathered, old bridge.  A rickety set of wooden stairs leads down."
