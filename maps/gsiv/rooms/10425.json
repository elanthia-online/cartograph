    "Most of the central area of this spacious room has been cordoned off, leaving a comfortable walkway around its perimeter, replete with padded leather benches and stools.  A trio of burnished chandeliers remain unlit as sunlight streams in through cut-glass windows from all four sides, illuminating the highly detailed, miniaturized terrain of the City-States laid out upon the floor.  A small alcove branches off from the main chamber to the north.  Several wooden cases line the walls, their glass fronts revealing tiny figures within."
