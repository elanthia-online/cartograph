  "description": [
    "The smell of sour small beer assaults your nose as you enter this rather cramped and hot booth.  Half-cured pelts of exotic creatures line the walls and a chair made of yellowed troll king bones sits in a half shadow in one corner.  Seated in the chair is the ruined hulk of a man, his potbelly, bulbous red nose and cracked leather armor show that he has long since given up caring for his appearance."
