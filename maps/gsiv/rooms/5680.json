    "Dark red silk cushions trimmed in velvet are placed atop neatly-ascending ledges along the opposing walls, the small steps rising nearly to the ceiling.  Painted high overhead are numerous stylized images of sleek housecats, some in repose and others simply standing there regarding everything below in a ponderous fashion.  The dim amber glow from excess candles placed throughout the room imparts a relaxing, lazy atmosphere to the surroundings."
