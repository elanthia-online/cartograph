    "Dirt ruts run westward out of the arch towards the center of the cemetery.  Old tombstones are scattered to either side, offering no sense of organization.  Several old marble tombs, partially obscured in growth, tower over the smaller headstones like silent sentinels and are silhouetted against the moonlit, sparkling waters of Maelstrom Bay beyond the edge of the bluff.",
