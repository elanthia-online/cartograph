  "description": [
    "The grey stone of the outer wall is a sharp contrast to the deep green pine of the surrounding trees.  Narrow lancet windows are set on either side of the black gate set in the wall, peering out like unseeing eyes.  Strands of ivy vines obscure the darker stones, smoothing the rough edges with the natural softness of their leaves, while adding another touch of green to the drab landscape.  Snow blankets the ground in pure white drifts, and a meandering path leads to the southwest through the copse of trees."
