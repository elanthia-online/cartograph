  "description": [
    "High in the canopy, rusted lanterns have become permanent fixtures of the forest where the bark from the limbs they dangle from has overtaken their simple metal rings.  An enormous blue tanik tree rises out of the center of the pathway causing the trail to fork around its enormous trunk which is partially fused with the shredded remains of a tent's skirt."
