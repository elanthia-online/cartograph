    "Speckled marble benches line the walls and are placed so that they provide adequate viewing of the booths that contain various food items.  An ivory-inlaid doorway leading to the museums curator's office is tucked away behind a glass display case, in which an odd assortment of knickknacks are kept to be used as treasured keepsakes.  Mounted on the wall above the benches is a stone tablet."
