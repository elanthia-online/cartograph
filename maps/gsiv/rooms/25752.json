    "Moonlight streams in through a window that affords a view of the beach and its glistening waters.  The soft white walls have been painted with stylized cerulean vines that are repeated in the motif of the dresser and nightstand.  A large hope chest rests at the foot of the bed, and a full-length mirror stands in the corner."
