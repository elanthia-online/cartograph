  "description": [
    "Airy windows with black lace valances dominate the northern wall of the small kitchen, while cupboards and shelves line the eastern and western sides from floor-to-ceiling.  Centered over a long oak table surrounded by rough pine benches, a wrought iron chandelier with burning tallows provides a uniform illumination that fills every corner of the space.  A round wicker basket rests on the striped floorboards."
