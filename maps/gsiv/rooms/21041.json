    "A hazy mist clings to the trees here, making it difficult to see beyond arm's length while sharp-bladed shrubs cling to the narrow path's edge, offering a painful surprise to anyone that strays too far.  Tangled vines drape from the treetops above, offering camouflage for snakes and small monkeys that chatter noisily while they swing from branch to branch."
