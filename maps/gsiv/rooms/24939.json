    "Sticking up out of deeply dug holes in the ground, several thick tree trunks serve as supports for the palm frond roof.  Spread beneath the ceiling, a thin layer of dirty blue woven cloth covers the floor.  Several pots of clay are scattered along one edge of the hut's floor, though the majority of the hut is laden with what appear to be rusty, slipshod tools for crafting armor and weapons.  The open walls of the hut allow for a clear view of the village."
