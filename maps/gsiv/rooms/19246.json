  "description": [
    "A level expanse of lawn holds rows of padded silver chairs, all of which point toward a raised marble dais.  Behind the dais, banners fly from each of four flagpoles, and torches burn at strategic points to illuminate the entire area.  Tall dark green hedges surround the meeting garden and rise to block the line of sight into adjacent areas.  Openings have been cut through the hedges in the western, southwestern, and southern directions, with each opening flanked by a pair of columnar junipers."
