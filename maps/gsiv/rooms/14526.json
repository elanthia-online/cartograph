    "Spear, black and bears-ear thistles form a thick, spiny barrier along both sides of the path.  Sedge and rat-rush cluster around spindly banksia trees, mottling the ground with shadows cast by their silvery, oval-shaped leaves.  Birds chatter loudly from their unseen perches, somewhere high in the greenery."
