    "Bright yellow canvas has been draped over rough aspen poles to create a cozy tent jam-packed with open crates and hanging baskets filled with fruit.  Crowded between sacks of flour and stacks of sugar tins, a wire cooling rack overflowing with hot pies sits atop a glass display case smudged with fingerprints.  The canvas flaps at the entrance have been tied back, allowing the aromas of freshly baked goods to waft outside, a mouthwatering advertisement of the wares on display."
