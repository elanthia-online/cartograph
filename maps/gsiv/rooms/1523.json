  "description": [
    "The overhanging bulk of stone buildings reduces the sky overhead to a mere stripe, casting the street into a deeper gloom even on nights when the sky is moonlit.  Occasional street lamps cast too little light to drive back the shadows that fill South 'Haven's aged \"on stone\" sector after dark.  Those who need to be out at this hour hasten about their business with a constant eye on those who chance to pass near them.",
    "The overhanging bulks of stone buildings reduce the sky to a mere star-spangled stripe.  This compounds the gloom cast by Vornavis's West Wall, which rises in a sheer stretch to the east and blocks out direct sunlight.  Beneath the haze of constant twilight, a perpetual flow of guildsmen, clerics, merchants, and servants fills the street, the sounds of their passing distorted by the unnatural tunnel.  A stone edifice with an ornate mansard roof watches the proceedings through baleful crimson-stained windows.",
