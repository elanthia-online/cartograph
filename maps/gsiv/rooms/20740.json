    "Barely decorated, this small office is encapsulated by ivory and pale blue striped walls, and is utterly cramped with furniture.  An expansive oak desk that looks to have barely fit through the door, its matching oak chair, and a tall bookcase have been placed so as to allow the best use of the space.  One wall is dominated by a square calendar marked with barely legible notations.  The opposite wall sports a glass-paned door, which serves as the only exit."
