    "Fences line the sides of this pathway, their presence moderately unobtrusive in the setting of dark green grasses, wildflowers, and sprawling fields beyond.  Though it is obvious this path is frequently used, it has not suffered great abuse, and the trails of wagon wheels are bordered and separated by swathes of lush grass."
