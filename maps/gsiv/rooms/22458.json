    "A quartz-inlaid white marble bench sits below paper lanterns and streamers in a pale rainbow of hues that have been draped from the low-hanging tree branches, creating a festive atmosphere.  The wind sighs through the trees, setting the streamers dancing to an unheard tune, and fluttering the leaves on sprigs of indigo wolfsbane that cluster around a white marble statue."
