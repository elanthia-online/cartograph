  "description": [
    "A large, broken pine stands here, creaking loudly in the occasional breeze that blows high overhead.  The pine was apparently struck by lightning long ago, as the bark is scorched and the tree is split clean through to the root.  Many eyes watch from the forest, the observers taking special care not to be noticed."
