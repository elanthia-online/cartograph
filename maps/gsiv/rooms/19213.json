    "The dim light from a torch casts a flickering light over the murky room causing dancing shadows to play over a rack of dusty wine bottles sitting against one wall.  Two large wine casks on the opposite wall nearly fill the rest of the room.  Sitting in the center of the bare floor is a small table."
