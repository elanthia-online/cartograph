    "A polished platform is positioned within the embrace of a couple of the host oak's substantial branches.  It gives access to a door leading into the tree's interior.  A round window is beside the door, its oak sill polished to a deep golden color.  Lobed leaves of the huge tree drape elegantly around the entrance,  its frame carved with a border of oak leaves and acorns."
