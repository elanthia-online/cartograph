  "description": [
    "The stairwell terminates at this hexagonal shaped room.  Walls of stone are interrupted by tall, multi-paned glaesine windows that stretch from the floor to the ceiling.  Between moonlit windows, ebonwood bookshelves line the walls.  The floor is grey-stained ash inlaid with an ivory border and covered by a polar bear hide rug at the center.  An ebonwood desk sits to one side before a pair of wingback black suede chairs.  Six sconces on the walls and a large wrought-iron chandelier are hung to illuminate the library.  An ebonwood ladder leads up to a hatch in the ceiling."
