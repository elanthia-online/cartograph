    "Wood tones and greenery predominate throughout the room.  A heavily polished, oak plank floor supports a heavy, walnut four-post bed, a forest green woven throw rug, a walnut dressing table, and two elegant walnut chairs.  The walls are paneled in the same shade of oak as the floor.  A tapestry of a relaxing forest scene hangs on two of the four walls, while another covers the ceiling.  A huge window of frosted glass occupies a third wall.  Potted plants are strategically placed."
