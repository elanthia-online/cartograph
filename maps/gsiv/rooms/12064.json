    "The water of the lake rises up above a series of stone steps leading no where.  Shards of pottery litter the rocky bank, but little remains of the homes that must have once lined the damp shore.  Perhaps this side of the river housed less opulent dwellings of brick and clay, more vulnerable to the effects of time than the granite structures in other areas of the city."
