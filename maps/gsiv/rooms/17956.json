    "A dozen overgrown green plants hang from the walls of this small chamber, their spidery vines draping themselves over a tall bookcase and trailing down the faded walls.  The only other furniture is a simple desk and chair standing in the center of the chamber.  A large potted palm partially conceals the boarded window."
