    "A thicket of willows edges the lake, their elongated branches dipping seductively into the water.  Loons swim in and out of the camouflage of the willow leaves, their unique song harmonizing with that of frogs and crickets.  Houses sit on a ridge above the boggy feet of the trees, their backs nestled into a stand of aspens."
