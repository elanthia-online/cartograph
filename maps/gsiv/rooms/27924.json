  "description": [
    "Pennants of crimson and gold adorn the fence which surrounds the single-story grey stone barracks.  The short-clipped grass is meticulously maintained, with nary a weed to be seen.  A wide, grey stone walkway leads from the gate to the barracks' reinforced oak door and precisely bisects the lawn into two practice yards, each filled with a number of soldiers practicing archery on targets or martial weapons on practice dummies."
