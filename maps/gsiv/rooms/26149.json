  "description": [
    "Chunks of mortar litter the ground, the gaps they once filled now offering a glimpse of the cloudy, star-spangled expanses beneath the fortress.  Smooth granite walls rise along the northern edge of the grounds, the deep crenellations playing court with the clouds and mists of the upper airs.  A pale sliver of light slips through the fortifications to illuminate a bright white lump wedged between uneven cobbles and the high bulwarks."
