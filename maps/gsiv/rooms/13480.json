    "Here in this secluded corner you find a small table covered with a red checkered tablecloth.  It is kept spotless and clean.  Gathered fabric covers portable screens that have sectioned off this area from the sales area of the store, and serve double duty by muffling your conversation.  Your vantage spot here allows you to spot anyone approaching your table."
