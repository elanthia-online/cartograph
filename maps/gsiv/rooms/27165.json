    "Dark and dingy, the small shop is filled with cloying scents and a stifling heat that is produced by a bronze brazier that occupies an entire corner.  Wide shelves take up much of the wall space, while a long glass counter stands guard over a narrow oak door and a large worktable covered with a variety of devices."
