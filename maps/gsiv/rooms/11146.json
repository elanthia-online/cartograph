    "Very little light penetrates this far into the back of the barn, making it hard to discern your surroundings.  Several piles of mold lie on the ground near the back wall, apparently once having been bales of hay.  Several metal rings hang on hooks on the wall, all that is left of feedbags long rotted away."
