    "Tower Hill looms darkly to the southeast, its fog-swirled base visible through an alley that leads to the heart of the village.  A massive tower, shadowed and hidden by mist, stretches upward from the apex of the hill.  The air is chilled by a crisp, damp wind, and the muddy road is marked with puddles that have formed in the grooves and footprints associated with frequent use."
