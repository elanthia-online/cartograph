    "Along the cavernous hallway, an immense mural, its hues vivid as gemstones, details the arduous training involved in mastering each of the guild skills.  Much detail prevails on the wall-canvas, from the determined stance of trainers to the shining pride in the eyes of a warrior when the pinnacle of a skill is achieved."
