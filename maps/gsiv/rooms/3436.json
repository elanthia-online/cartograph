    "On either side of a carpeted entry are two dark yew trees, trimmed into the shapes of mules and sprinkled with silvery powder.  A young halfling in silver and blue livery bows low as you pass by, gesturing toward the doorway with an inviting smile on his lips.  From inside the gaming hall comes a rising cry, as someone wins another hand."
