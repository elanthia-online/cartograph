    "Hanging from a copper stand, a beautiful golden birdcage sways back and forth, a pair of small canaries fluttering about inside.  Polished linden floors peek out from under a rich cerulean carpet crafted with patterns that swirl in upon themselves.  A white marble pedestal stands against one wall, a beautiful porcelain windflower displayed inside a clear glass case.  Several unique doors line the walls on either side of the hall."
