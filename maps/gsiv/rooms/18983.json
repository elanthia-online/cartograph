    "Reflective flecks of quartz and mica glimmer along the small tiles lining the web of walkways along the western rise of the cavern.  Lacy, glowing bluish-grey moss clings to the edges of the several large holes, highlighting the openings that lead to the guild's alchemical workshops.  A faint odor of sulfur and salt lingers in the air."
