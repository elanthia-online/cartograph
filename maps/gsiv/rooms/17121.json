    "A verdant, neatly maintained area of the courtyard is a testament to continuous and dedicated upkeep.  A couple of carved stone benches with polished marble inlay offer a temporary respite from the arduous training atmopshere palpable throughout the guild grounds.",
    "The verdant, neatly maintained area of the courtyard is even more striking during nighttime as fluttering torches help suffuse light, but also create swaggering shadows all around.  A couple of carved stone benches with polished marble inlay offer a temporary respite from the arduous training atmopshere palpable throughout the guild grounds, even after dark."
