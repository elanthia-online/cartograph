    "Wave-edged light maple frames decorate the sides of a carved ebony bookcase displaying a variety of writing utensils and other sundry items.  A bookish elven clerk works tirelessly behind a dark maple counter, pulling sheafs of paper and covers from a cloth-lined chest.  Occasionally, bits of torn paper float lazily through the air and land on the floor."
