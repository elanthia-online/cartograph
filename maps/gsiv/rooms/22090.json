    "The vast forest of oak and modwir trees stretches out in every direction, broken up only by a wide expanse of stumps.  The field ends at a thick gathering of trees that seems to spread out endlessly.  Nearby, a few wagons have been loaded with lumber and rest near a crate of weathered hatchets."
