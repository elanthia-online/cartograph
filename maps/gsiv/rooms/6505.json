    "A damp mist seems to seep from the very walls of this vast chamber casting the walls in an eerie green pallor.  A large round stone stands upright in the center of the room, rotating like a coin that has been stood on edge and spun.  The opening at the center of the stone is pitch black and odd runes are engraved around the edge.  A low steady hum emanates from the stone, and the sound soothes your tired nerves."
