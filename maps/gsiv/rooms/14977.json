  "description": [
    "Several ancient grey stones rest beneath the trees, half-buried by the shifting ground over the centuries.  On closer examination, they appear to be grave-markers, though any inscriptions have long since been worn away.  The path continues along the iron fence to the northeast, and a narrow trail leads into a dark glade to the east.  A small clearing lies to the south."
