  "description": [
    "A cobblestone path halts at the foot of a garden wall made of large flagstones.  Moss and lichens grow in pockets in the rock, studding the wall with lacy viridian fronds.  Sitting in the center of the luxuriant growth, a cottage rests in the shade from a tall oak tree, the dwelling's green shutters complementing the surrounding foliage.  Something about the dwelling seems different, out of the ordinary, as if the place exudes an ambiance that is alive."
