    "Perched just beyond the edges of the aspen grove, a stone-lined pond spreads to the north and east.  Large stepping stones lead to a tiny island that is surrounded by steaming water, though its edges are encased in frost and snow.  Holly, cut to be a low ground shrub, adds a splash of crimson to the pristinely white scene on the tiny piece of land."
