    "Crude wooden benches ascend in a semicircle around a smooth dirt arena where old blood stains have darkened the ground in many patches.  Lit torches are scattered about the room casting flickering shadows along the stone walls.  A pile of dismembered siege miniatures have been haphazardly left in a corner."
