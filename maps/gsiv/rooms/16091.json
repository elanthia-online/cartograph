    "Pots of paint, their lips smeared with a startling array of colors, are lined up on a bench.  Stacked against the wall are planks of various types of wood in a number of different sizes.  Ceramic tiles of the purest white, the deepest blue, and the brightest green are stacked in wooden crates against the wall."
