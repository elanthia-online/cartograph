    "Thick vines hang down from overhead trees, their lengths tangled up with one another to create an extra curtain of green in the already dense jungle.  A heavy mist floats through the air, completely covering the jungle floor, as well as nearly obscuring the montage of mossy trees that clump together and create a barrier in all directions."
