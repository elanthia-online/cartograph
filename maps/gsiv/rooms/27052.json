    "Several rough-hewn tree stumps in various states of decay have been set in an almost circular fashion around a warped plank of mildewed oak, creating a makeshift table arrangement.  Tiny mounds of whitish powder and small translucent wings are visible all around, a telltale sign of a massive termite infestation."
