    "Tangy ocean breezes whip across the stubby grasses dotting the near-barren overlook.  Small pinpoints of light pierce the eddying mist from above, the starlight dancing briefly in the ocean waves.  At the base of the overlook dark shapes interspersed with glints of light can be seen on the water.  Dense and uninviting, the pitch black jungle looms to the east in a stark contrast to the airy coastal cliffs continuing southward."
