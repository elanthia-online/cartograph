    "Sparkling from above, a multi-tiered chandelier of brass-swirled crystal orbs imbues the narthex with sunny brilliance.  Panels of white birch gleam in the pale stone walls, each incised with the outline of a golden crown.  Across from a mosaic-tiled high golden archway, a velvet-draped marble stairway as wide as a city street rises toward a sprawling indoor plaza."
