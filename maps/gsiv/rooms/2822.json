    "The trail meanders and curves, dancing around the feet of trees that grow more substantial the higher one climbs.  Above, an opening in the branch cover allows light to reach a number of dogwood trees huddling in the small clearing.  An immense giant of a pine stands staunchly to the north, its feet and lower branches forcing the path to sneak past by veering southwest.",
