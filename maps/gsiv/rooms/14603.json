  "description": [
    "Although water is visible down here, none of it can be reached because of the mass of wooden shingles that fill the bottom of the well.  Clearly someone made the effort to collect all of the shingles fallen from the roofs of the manor and the stable and throw them down here.  Reduced to a mass of rotting, waterlogged wood, the shingles fill the well to several inches above the level of the water."
