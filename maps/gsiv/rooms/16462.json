    "A brawny, bare-chested giantman, a massive tool belt strapped around his waist, works busily in a small area, sorting heavy planks of a variety of woods.  Various sheets of plans and orders have been tacked up on the rear wall of the backroom, where a wooden table supports a brass-banded ale barrel."
