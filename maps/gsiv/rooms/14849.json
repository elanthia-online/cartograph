    "The ground here is spotted with dozens of bright violet stargazers and short bushes of dark crimson and pale pink roses.  A cool breeze continues to blow, its gentle touch caressing your skin.  A soft rustling sound comes from the foliage at the foot of the fence, perhaps caused by some small animal or other."
