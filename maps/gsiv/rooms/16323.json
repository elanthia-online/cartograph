    "Reddish tiling spreads across the floor in pleasant contrast to the white stucco walls.  A trio of curving arches to the west open up into the showroom, while a simple arch to the north leads out into an open-air courtyard.  Just adjacent, a large bamboo desk has been commandeered by a massive collection of papers and half-full dye bottles."
