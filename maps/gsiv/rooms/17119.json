    "Rough white stucco walls rise from a varnished dark oak floor.  Just above a plush black bear fur rug hangs a tattered merchant permit, and a swirl-painted white stucco ceiling completes the picture.  A Vornavian silk-lined display case and a plain wooden table stand side by side in the middle of the room."
