    "Timeworn meditation mats and prayer rugs lay scattered about the room, their woven threads only slightly less frayed than the tapestries that hang from the walls.  Though muted by the stone ceiling and walls, the howl of the wind can be heard within this sanctuary and what tendrils spill in from the door set the cobwebs and dust astir."
