    "Rows of small cabinets stacked against the wall serve to hold an emergency supply of healing herbs.  A mannequin covered in bandages and tourniquets leans haphazardly in one corner, and a pair of cots stand ready to receive the wounded in another corner.  Glass plates in the ceiling allow sunlight to pour through, and creeping vines, ivies and philodendrons cover the white tile floor, the walls, and anything that fails to move regularly.",
