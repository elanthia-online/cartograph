    "Crenellated granite walls provide protection for archers, but offer little defense against the ever-present northern winds at this altitude.  From this vantage point, the lights of surrounding lodges and townships become tiny constellations mirroring the ones above you.  Though now home only to a pair of snowy owls that have built a nest in the lee of one wall, a discarded ballista bolt suggests the roof recently held weapons of war.  A tall flagpole stands firmly in the ironwood planking."
