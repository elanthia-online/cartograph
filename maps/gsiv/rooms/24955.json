    "A grouping of slightly squared, open-faced huts are just barely visible in one direction, and in the other direction, a path leads into denser parts of the forest.  Just barely audible above the constant, deafening buzzing of the insects is the faint sound of rushing water.  Thin sticks of bamboo have been whittled and laid out across several trees, a series of teeth on several strands displayed upon them."
