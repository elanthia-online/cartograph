    "Thickets of shrubs, ancient trees, and clinging liana vines accentuate the untamed jungle.  Amongst the shadows, gnarled tree roots descending into the soil resemble crippled fingers clawing fiercely at the dirt as they tangle over each other in a struggle for space with the plants.  The faint sounds of nocturnal creatures break the oppressive silence of night, and shafts of moonlight cast subtle illumination as they reflect from the surface of rainwater collected within dead tree limbs."
