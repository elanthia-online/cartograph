  "description": [
    "A strong odor emanates from a large stack of hay heaped along the fence to the east.  Long-rotted fruits and vegetables have collapsed upon themselves and each other, staining the hay darkly with shades of red, orange, and brown.  A bushel of seemingly ripe apples stands on the opposite side of the street, next to a red brick house with a recently swept walkway."
