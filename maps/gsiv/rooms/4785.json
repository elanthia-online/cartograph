    "Pine needles appear to flow like rivers underneath the conifers and around the rock outcroppings.  The rocks are rather soft, being mostly layered shale, and seem to break off easily, scattering their flat gravel down the slope from the main exposed deposits.  Occasionally these pieces scatter over the roadway to slip between the cobblestones.  The sharp shale edges then puncture and slash the bottoms of passing feet and footwear."
