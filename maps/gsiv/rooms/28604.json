  "description": [
    "This semi-circular room at the east side of the temple features a large silver crescent moon inlaid upon a floor of black marble edged with white alabaster.  A fresco of an ocean teaming with wildlife has been richly painted upon the ceiling, yet the walls feature a cloud-filled sunny sky.  Compounding the topsy-turvy distortion, moisture overhead falls in occasional large drops, seeping from some hidden underground water source."
