    "Several bushes covered with berries cling to the bank of the creek.  The berries are plump and dark, and very tempting, but as you reach for some you notice the corpse of a small animal beneath the bush.  Several half-eaten berries sit near the body, and you wonder if eating anything from these bushes would be a good idea.  The bank seems solid enough for you to walk into the creek without difficulty."
