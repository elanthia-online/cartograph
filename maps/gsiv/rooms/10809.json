    "Something or somethings rustle nearby in the underbrush, causing the bushes and small trees to waver slightly.  The undergrowth is so thick, though, that it is impossible to get near the source of the disturbance.  Every so often the rustlings are punctuated by short, high-pitched squealings and quiet growlings as the action shifts from point to point."
