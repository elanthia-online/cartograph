  "description": [
    "Highly polished, interlocking planks create the masterfully designed flooring in the tavern.  Several pitch black mossbark stools line a fully stocked, elongated marble bar.  A marble fireplace, crafted in the image of a griffin perched on a mountain top, dominates the rear.  A small draft from an open window pulls small puffs of smoke from off the griffin's eye.  Three small steps lead the way down into a black sand roshambo pit."
