    "Navy blue rugs bordered with braided gold rope and bright white anchors cushion the long hallway as it stretches to the east and west.  Wrought iron rings dangle from the ceiling and hold aloft glass-fronted lanterns that shed bright yellow light and dispel all surrounding shadows.  Standing opposite each other, a windowed black door has the words, \"Office of the Cooperative Houses of Elanthia,\" etched into its glass, while a windowed red door has the words, \"Office of Transportation,\" etched on its glass."
