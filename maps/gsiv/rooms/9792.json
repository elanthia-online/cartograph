    "Thin roots worm their way along the walls and ceiling, some of the wiry tendrils hanging limply in the still, musty air.  A few warped pieces of metal jut up from the floor, while others are nearly buried in the smooth earth.  Miniscule cracks wind along the walls, the crevices illuminated faintly by the tiny slivers of luminescent fungi growing between them."
