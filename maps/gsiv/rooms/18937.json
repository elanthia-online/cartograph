    "The cedar planks and supports containing this small room creak ominously, as if bearing a huge weight.  A thriving colony of sea lichen blankets the floor, and a single guttering torch casts a pale illumination in this hot, salty room.  Strange pulsations and rings of reddish light move underneath the lichen, inward from the walls to meet at the room's center.  The constant magnified sound of a slow heartbeat reverberates in the chamber."
