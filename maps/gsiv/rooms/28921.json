  "description": [
    "Built against the rough stockade fence that encircles the colony, a set of stone reinforced stairs climbs to a parapet built along the top of the wall.  Water sluiced through gutters along the roof of a fortified tower spills upon the ground, creating a muddy mess that the locals avoid by making walkways of rough oak planks.  A large blackened fist painted within a canary yellow sun decorates the lowest floor of the tower."
