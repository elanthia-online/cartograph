    "A short dock extends partway into the serene waters of a small pond.  Miniscule waves lap against the pylons, stirred only by the most gentle of breezes.  Moonlight sparkles on the water, and the tall grasses surrounding the pond sway in unison with the flitting of the fireflies.  On the shore just beyond the dock, a small fire pit containing a well-maintained blaze is surrounded by granite slabs.  A few paces away is a small wooden shack.",
