    "The pleasant sound of water sloshing against the wooden beams of a small dock echoes throughout the area, and the walkway branches up a bit to accommodate the short little pier that extends into the lake.  Clusters of water-lilies float along the edge of the water and underneath the dock, their subtle fragrance wreathing the area.  A single black willow graces the edge of the shore, its long vines whispering soft, indecipherable phrases as they brush against one another quietly."
