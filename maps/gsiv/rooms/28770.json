  "description": [
    "A sleek railing of polished pine with swirling electrum inlay encircles the upper landing, from which the entire lobby is visible.  Rich burgundy carpet is soft underfoot, stretching though the long hallways which lead away from the landing in three directions.  A leather chaise lounge upholstered in ivory suede sits near the railing, a perfect spot for watching the comings and goings below."
