  "description": [
    "A plush sky blue rug covers the majority of the plank flooring.  Spanning across the far wall, a wide four-poster bed, carved from wood and twined with sawgrass, is dressed with dark azure and white bedding.  Issuing a shadowy, flickering illumination, copper sconces are lit with dim flames, several of which are clustered around a narrow door.  Above a tall armchair and a rustic table, the ceiling is charred to a blacker than midnight hue."
