    "Only found by way of a narrow break in the surrounding trees, the round clearing provides an impressive setting for the wide, crescent-shaped waterfall.  Stones ring the basin, like seats in an arena, covered along the top with thick moss encouraged by the perpetual misty spray.  Jutting out from the rockface behind the cascading water, a wide ledge creates just enough shelter for those who dare to wander close."
