    "Mutated and wilted swamp buttercups droop listlessly above shallow water.  Fallen leaves and cypress needles litter the ground, almost unnoticed under the dim light of the moon.  A large hole rests near the flared base of a tree that has been split straight down its middle.  At the entrance of the hole, the shredded remains of what may have once been a cloak are visible.",
    "Fallen leaves and cypress needles are noticeable at the bottom of the shallow water.  Mutated and wilted swamp buttercups droop listlessly above the water.  Their distorted waxy leaves, which should be a vibrant yellow, are a dull ruddy shade of brown and are splattered with bluish-green mold.  A large hole rests near the flared base of a tree that has been split straight down its middle.  At the entrance of the hole, the shredded remains of what may have once been a cloak are visible."
