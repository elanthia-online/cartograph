    "A narrow window offers a view of the inner courtyard below and in case of emergency, an archer's perch for the determined defenders of the outpost.  The hallway is divided by a thick brown bearskin rug that runs its length, separating two sets of doors.  A single Hendoran guard stands sentry beside the iron-bound wooden doorway."
