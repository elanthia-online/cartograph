    "Along the ivory-toned brick western wall is a massive black-enameled stove set within a carved ivory limestone backsplash, and flanked on either side by some tall oak cabinets.  The pure white marble northern wall features a three-sectioned window which illuminates the area with dappled moonlight.  A posh granite countertop, nestled under the window, houses a large sink with well-oiled oak cabinets underneath.  The eastern section of the area expands into a grand dining area featuring an enormous intricately carved lor table with plentiful seating."
