  "description": [
    "Wildflowers of every color abound, their rich aroma filling the air.  A willow tree stands proudly in the center of the beds, its leafy garlands caressing the ground and swaying gently in the breeze.  To the west is a crystal blue pond, and beyond that sit two wooden benches and a table, providing an inviting spot to sit and relax in the warm sun.  A small cottage sits back in the southwest corner with a gazebo opposite it."
