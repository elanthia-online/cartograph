    "The path here is choked with weeds and vines.  Bushes close in on the path, nearly closing it to further travel.  The main road to the northwest looks much easier to travel.  The path grows rougher to the east.  Shaped like a balled-up fist with a single extended finger, a large boulder points accusingly at the bone white tower looming above you on a rocky hillock."
