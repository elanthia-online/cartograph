  "description": [
    "The path wanders through the ruins of old stone buildings, now moss-covered and hung with vines and leafy lianas.  Rough, dark red stones and small white bones are arranged in a crude pattern beside the well-swept path.  The jungle foliage has been trimmed back to preserve the width of the path."
