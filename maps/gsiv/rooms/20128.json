    "A large copper still is perched upon a stand of iron grating near a cleared and rock-lined fire circle.  Wooden buckets filled with rainwater have capped off spigots near their bases and rest on three flat, low-cut stumps nearby.  Coils of hammered copper tubing encircle the still's base and a stack of firewood awaits the next brewing.  Beyond the apparatus is a seedy-looking tavern, and to the east is an enormous ancient banyan.",
