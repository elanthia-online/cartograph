    "There is a sense of coordinated bedlam to this office.  Papers, faded ledger books, bills of lading, and ominous-looking legal documents are scattered about on Turpin's desk in such a way that there is a discernable pattern.  However, it's not a pattern that follows any normal logic.  Ceramic, turtle-shaped oil lamps provide a cheerful glow to the office."
