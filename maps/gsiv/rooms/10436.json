    "A large divan covered in plush garnet-hued velvet rests along the rear wall of the bar.  To one side, a carved monir bar holds an array of delicate glassware, the faceted glaes sparkling in the light cast from several dimly glowing wall sconces.  An engraved eahnor sign sits upon the bar's polished countertop."
