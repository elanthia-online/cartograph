    "Although small, the inside of the tent is organized and tidy.  Neatly piled boxes and trunks line the walls, leaving a clear path around a rough walnut table.  Tucked to one side of the opening is a large wooden crate, its surface painted with small stick figures.  A variety of toys can be seen nestled between the stacks."
