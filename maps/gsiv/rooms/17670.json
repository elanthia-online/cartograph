  "description": [
    "The proprietor of the stall stands behind a counter, polishing it with a rag attached to a hook, which in turn is attached to his wrist.  The stall is large enough to offer a minor semblance of privacy and several crates are stacked around it as impromptu seating.  Behind the tender, several shelves are decorated with a collection of bottles of various size and color."
