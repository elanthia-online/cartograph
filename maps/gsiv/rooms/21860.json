    "The pavilion's walls are crafted of deep purple silk, shifting with the slightest breeze.  White banners hang from the walls, each one depicting a colorful and detailed depiction of a beautiful landscape, from crisp snowy mountains to lush river valleys.  A dark haired human with multi-hued eyes sits near some paint-splattered tables, cleaning some brushes in jars of water.  Behind him rises a tall wooden supply shelf."
