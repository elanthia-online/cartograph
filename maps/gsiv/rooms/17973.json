    "A beautifully woven tapestry depicting a view of the great mountain Aenatumgana covers the north wall of the low-ceilinged, tranquil chamber.  Silken mats cover the floor, and a low enameled table holds a bowl of fragrant incense and an iron brazier that warms the room against the chill draft that blows through the bamboo curtain in the west wall."
