  "description": [
    "This natural hollow is deeper than it is tall, and strings of lights with colorful shades draped along the walls illuminate the niche in an array of colors.  At the rear of the space near the ceiling, a small hammock stretches from one side to the other, little more than a vibrant scrap of cloth strung between two hooks.  Beneath is an elaborately carved oak counter, atop which rests a many-limbed jewelry tree, and a plush rainbow-hued rug cushions the floor."
