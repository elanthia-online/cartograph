    "The small, bright woodland clearing bounds a small overhanging ledge of granite on the south side, looking out over a scenic view of the vast wooded valley and the distant road beyond.  Thick moss carpets the flat, sun-warmed stone, and sparrows and finches flutter and chirp in the branches of the surrounding oaks.",
    "The small, moonlit woodland clearing bounds a small overhanging ledge of granite on the south side, looking out over a scenic view of the vast wooded valley and the distant road beyond.  Thick moss carpets the darkened stone, and an owl hoots softly somewhere nearby in the branches of the surrounding oaks."
