  "description": [
    "Nearly hidden beneath the hanging branches of a large, towering banyan tree, a series of wide wooden barrels are filled with a variety of floating pumpkins.  Splayed out around the barrels is a web of vines blooming with ripe, orange pumpkins, several gigantic in size.  The dirt surrounding the pumpkins is well-groomed, with small worms and bugs visibly crawling about in the tilled earth, and a healthy pumpkin patch stretches far out into the misty haze of the swamp."
