  "description": [
    "Filigreed floor-to-ceiling windows reveal a colorful walled-in garden, the flora tended in several terra cotta pots that line the perimeter of the shop.  The floor of the room has been scattered with various paeline pillows, the cushions accompanied by thick blankets of soft fur.  Set against the far wall is a carved silvered haon table, covered in various swatches of fabric and loosely rolled sketches of clothing and jewelry."
