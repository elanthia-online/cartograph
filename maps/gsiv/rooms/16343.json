  "description": [
    "A simple shell-pink rug lies across a polished maple floor, inviting customers into the cozy foyer of this well-maintained establishment.  The mild scent of lavender and mint drift through the air, wafting from the potpourri censers laid about the room.  Several people mill about the area taking note of the framed drawings of various housing exterior options hung along the walls."
