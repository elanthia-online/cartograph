    "A pair of cast iron sconces hangs on one of the whitewashed stucco walls, and a mosiac-tiled ceiling rises overhead.  A glass-fronted bookcase sits in one corner of a carpet-covered floor.  There is an aqua-hued seaglass display on one side of the shop and a long mistwood counter on the other."
