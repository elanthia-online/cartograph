    "Two large holes in the wall mark the one-time home of the rusted iron bar that has collapsed and fallen into the seawater that flows through the area.  A marble stand rises above the water, its surface scratched, chipped, and burned.  Three large portions of broken pottery, faded and weathered, rest at its base."
