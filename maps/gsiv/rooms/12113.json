    "The sounds of battle cut through the air.  Melee rages around you, threatening to draw you in.  People, dressed only in shreds of clothing, beat each other into the ground, climbing over the bodies of their fallen comrades in an attempt to reach a pile of gold and gems at the far side of the field.  From this distance, the pile seems to be shaped like a mocking horned head, looking on at the destruction with evil glee."
