    "Deliberately arranged across the stone flooring to create a checkerboard pattern are sage green rush mats that are trimmed with a deep ebony border.  Along the back wall, an overburdened desk is practically buried under stacks of papers and ledgers.  Lost in thought, the workshop foreman stands in front of a fresco depicting a landscape of an ancient forest with snow-capped mountains in its distance."
