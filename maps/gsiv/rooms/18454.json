  "description": [
    "A grape vine grows here, supported by a thin lattice of unfinished wood.  Large, golden-hued grapes are plump on the vine, and standing close to them reveals a scent so luscious and sweet that it is almost overwhelming.  The vines are heavy enough that they droop near the ground, and the taller stalks of grass get lost among the wide leaves.  Nearly hidden by a cascade of leaves, a gilt-toned statue stands at the end of the lattice."
