  "description": [
    "A narrow desk with a bouquet of forget-me-nots perched cheerfully on its top is set before a short hallway.  Highly polished lamps brighten up every corner of this crowded room, encouraging you to warm yourself before setting out again.  A crystal statue of a penguin, nearly as tall as a halfling, twinkles in the light."
