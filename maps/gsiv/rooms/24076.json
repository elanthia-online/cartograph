  "description": [
    "The tree opens up into an abstract circular space encased by craggy, natural wood polished to a golden finish, and a ramp carved directly into the oak climbs ever upward into the loftier hollow reaches above.  Flameless candles that nevertheless emit a brilliant incandescence light the upward journey from their niches above the ramp, while drifting through the air are small motes of light in varying hues of soft blues and greens, idly bobbing in place to fill the tree with muted shades of luminescence."
