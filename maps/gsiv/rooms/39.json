    "Carved on either side of the tunnel with the crest of House Illistim, the tunnel walls otherwise appear impossibly smooth, the dark grey-blue granite ground to a velvet-like finish.  Several city guards stand to the side, casually observing passersby in the dim light of the tunnel's amber lanterns.",
