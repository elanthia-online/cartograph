    "Carved on either side of the tunnel with the crest of House Illistim, the tunnel walls otherwise appear impossibly smooth, the dark grey-blue granite ground to a velvet-like finish.

    "Carved on either side of the tunnel with the crest of Ta'Illistim, the tunnel walls otherwise appear impossibly smooth, the silvery blue granite ground to a velvet-like finish.  Lanterns, spaced out evenly in a lattice pattern, put out a bright, unflickering blue light.",
