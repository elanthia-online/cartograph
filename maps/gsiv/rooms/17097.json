    "Stout cedar poles support grassy thatching to shade this bluff.  A short cedar fence wraps around three sides of the bluff, keeping the unwary or perhaps the inebriated from falling to the rocks below.  Maelstrom Bay stretches out to the west, and the thick dark forest confronts the Bay's waters to the north and south.  Reclining chairs are strewn haphazardly about the bluff, and a small table accompanies each chair.  A windowless redwood building sits nearby, and a steep ramp ascends to the northeast."
