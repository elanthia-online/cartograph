    "The mahogany paneled walls of two hallways meet at right angles in this room, giving the illusion of extra space in this area.  A small sitting area, consisting of a single, long stone bench has been set up near the base of a huge statue.  The marble statue appears to be gazing down at the floor near the northern corner of the room."
