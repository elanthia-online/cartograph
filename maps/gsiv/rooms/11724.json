    "Folded white sheets buried under the dust of ages sits on a wooden table that takes up much of the available space in the small storage room.  A metal wash tub rests underneath the table, along with a rippled piece of metal with a wooden handle and a stack of yellowed bars of soap.  A single window slit, set high on the wall just above a three-legged stool, draws light into the room, illuminating only the disrepair of abandonment.",
