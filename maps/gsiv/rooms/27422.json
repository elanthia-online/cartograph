  "description": [
    "Smooth wooden walls encapsulate the room, their surfaces carved with vines.  Bundles of herbs hang from the ceiling, filling the room with a floral scent.  Along one wall is a set of shelves holding crystal balls.  Pendulums hang from a small wire rack, and boxes and bowls sit on a carved rosewood bench.  In the center of the room, a large table is covered in toy gnomes.  A tall oak stand with baskets hanging from it stands next to the door.  Above the stand is an exclamation point shaped sign."
