    "The trail widens, running along the top of a sheer, rocky cliff.  A few scraggly bushes cling to the side of the hill above the trail, a lone modwir towering over them like a shepherd tending his flock.  A small brown chipwit flutters back and forth between the modwir and the ground, carrying grasses and fallen needles to line its nest."
