    "A stone block path winds among brass pots containing floribunda roses, rounded azaleas and brilliant firebushes.  Several iron tubes radiate heat into the room to raise steam from the flowerbeds and give the room a humid yet pleasant atmosphere.  Tight groups of orange marigolds thrive in the moist conditions.  The frosted glass above passes enough sunlight that the torches along the wall are not necessary.  Metal rocking chairs occupy prominent positions in this quiet garden.",
