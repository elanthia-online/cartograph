  "description": [
    "Smooth, pristine white sand gives way to a rippled, slightly darker counterpart as it stretches toward the water's edge.  The gentle lapping of Lake Eonak, along with the soft sounds of local wildlife, enhance the calming surroundings.  Brilliant sunlight glints off several glass windows of the house bordering the northern edge of the private beach.  A narrow set of stone steps hugs the hillside and leads to a deck.  Positioned a safe distance from the lake is a round firepit surrounded by blackened sand, and closeby is a cushioned loveseat suspended from weathered wooden beams by thick chains."
