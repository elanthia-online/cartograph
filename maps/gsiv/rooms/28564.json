    "Ominous clouds of colorless grey lacerate the sky, dark claw marks against a firmament already bathed in crimson and broken with riotous lightning.  Whether a trick of the eye or reality in motion, the opaque murk seems to crawl when observed directly, yet when glimpsed from the corner of the eye, it races by.  The effect is disorienting, and accompanied by the near-constant flashes behind their veil, it makes the world outside of this crumbling arena seem to spiral unchecked within the abyss."
