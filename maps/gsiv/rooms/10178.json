    "The path crosses a leveled out area on the side of the hill and splits off in two directions as it skirts a formidable rise of speckled grey granite.  Runoff from many seasons of rain has formed a small gully down the middle of the fork in the path, a jagged indentation that snakes across the dusty surface, then disappears into a clump of bushes growing along the edge of the trail."
