    "Despite attempts at sprucing up the dilapidated structure, the shop remains dingy and smells of decaying wood.  Several rugs are placed about the soiled floor, for both the comfort of the shopper and the protection of the tables set about to display the wares.  A large colorful banner seems woefully out of place amongst the faded wooden walls.  Colorful crates, overflowing with sand and beach toys, fill the corners and makeshift shelves line the walls."
