  "description": [
    "Desiccated local fish have been set upon boughs of dried seaweed that drape across the ceiling.  A layer of gritty sand has worked itself into the cracks and crevices of the weathered floorboards which, combined with the omnipresent mist of the sea, makes traction an uncertain prospect.  A large tank, its contents announced by a garish purple and yellow sign, occupies what little floor space is available."
