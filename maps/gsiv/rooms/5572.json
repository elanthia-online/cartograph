  "description": [
    "Unwilling to disrupt the symmetrical spacing of the arrow slits along the tower's west wall just to provide access to the tower's roof, the builders constructed a narrow, freestanding set of steps that rise from near the wall of the inner chamber and end little more than a pace from the outer wall.  Empty quarrel bins and an empty barrel, of a size to hold cloth yard shafts, are lined up along the wall between the arrow slits."
