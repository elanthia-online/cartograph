    "The Celebration Hall stands before you, its wide red-carpeted steps leading up to a pair of ornately embossed golden doors.  Rising beyond the red tiled roof of the foyer, the mithril-latticed crystal dome of the main hall glows with light from the myriad of candles within.  Tucked close in the shadow of the Celebration Hall, an ivy-covered arch pierces a neatly trimmed hedge.",
