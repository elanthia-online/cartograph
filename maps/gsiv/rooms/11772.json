  "description": [
    "A circle of ancient cypress trees surrounds the quiet graveyard.  The carved markers, gravestones and statues have been kept free of moss, and offerings of flowers rest near the most recent memorials.  To the south side of the small cemetery stands a simple stone chapel, its double doors open both day and night."
