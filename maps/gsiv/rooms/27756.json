    "A coastal breeze meanders over the rooftop, carrying with it the sounds and scents of the nearby sea.  Nothing but darkness can be seen at any angle, and the incessant crashing of waves against the rocky shore reverberates through the night.  Climbing ivy creeps over the lantern-lit granite balustrade encircling the open space, the leafy vines continuing up the columns of an extensive stone trellis overhead.  Beneath the trellis is a massive carved lor table with a variety of chairs gathered around it.  Smoked glass doors lead into a domed interior area.",

Stunning views of the coastline can be seen at all angles, with seabirds floating above the sunlit rocky shore where foamy white waves crash incessantly.

Beneath the trellis is a massive carved lor table with a variety of chairs gathered around it.  Smoked glass doors lead into a domed interior area."
