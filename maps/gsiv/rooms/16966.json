    "Three massive pillars of flame rise up to the south, their faceted glimaerstone surfaces awash in blazing infernos of differing hues.  Shallow steps ascend toward the pillars, and the walls are swept with sinuous patterns reminiscent of the raging storm of fire that courses all around you, its furious intensity controlled by the surrounding walls of crystal."
