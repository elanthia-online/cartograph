    "Partially covered, the trunk of a thick rosewood tree peeks out from the choking embrace of young banyan roots. Sturdy liana vines twine about several other trees, reaching for the rich canopy above.  Scrubby bushes rise up at irregular intervals, locking the hot, decaying air down below the dense cover.  Clusters of fungus dot the forest floor."
