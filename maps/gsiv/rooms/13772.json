    "Stretching to every corner of the room, a thick and dusty woolen rug covers the majority of the dark oak floor between the carved haon counter and paneled dark mahogany walls.  Matching silk-draped tables stand on either side of the double doors leading out of the shop, pushed against the angled walls.  Hanging from the mahogany-beamed ceiling, a large wrought iron chandelier casts a flickering luminescence across the shop."
