    "Strands of tealight-hung rope weave in and out along the ceiling of the tent, the miniscule glass spheres twinkling like fireflies against the muted blue-violet silk walls.  A large ivory linden waterlily serves as a makeshift table in the center of the room, the blossom surrounded by several rounded faenor lilypads containing various wares.  Layers of bluish leather line the ground, the rugs sprinkled in a mixture of glittery confetti leaking from a chain-strung crystal bowl next to the exit."
