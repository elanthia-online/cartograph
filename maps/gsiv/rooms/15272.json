    "Varnished ebonwood walls rise from a dark-stained oak floor.  Just above a sphere-topped black marble fountain hangs a trio-bladed mounted vellum fan, and an ebonwood beam ceiling completes the picture.  An intricately carved ebonwood stand and a gold-trimmed ebonwood chest stand side by side in the middle of the room."
