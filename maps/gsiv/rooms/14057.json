    "A small wooden framework covered in tattered canvas lies against the south wall.  Inside you see a small smelter and bits of verdigris-covered material.  A low workbench with a very small anvil and a flat tipped hammer on it sits next to the smelter.  A wooden barrel filled with rainwater lies at the end of the workbench."
