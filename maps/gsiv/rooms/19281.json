    "Crumbling stone walls reveal wet earth behind them, from which vines and roots spring forth with clingy tendrils.  Darkly colored fel flooring is inset with a large, perfect circle of pale willow wood in the center of the room.  The ceiling rises up in a small, golden dome dotted with glowing specks of black, like dark constellations against a sunlit sky.  A jeweled chest resides against the wall opposite a curved stone arch."
