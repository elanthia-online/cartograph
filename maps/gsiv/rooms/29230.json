  "description": [
    "A circle of severed stumps dominates the landscape, with only some spindly saplings and ground-hugging shrubs lending traces of greenery to the space.  The average diameter of the stumps is over four feet, indicating true giants were felled here.  Overhead, a few semi-wilted vines drape from the narrow-trunked, immature trees along the perimeter."
