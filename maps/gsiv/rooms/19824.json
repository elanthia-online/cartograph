    "Two statues gaze down from the eastern wall, each separated by a fluted marble column.  One is a robed figure whose head is hidden in the folds of her robes with feathered wings folded at her sides, while the other is a depiction of pure madness, her hair flowing wildly about her crazed face.  Arcing patterns of moonstone and silver wind their way across the smooth white floor, interwoven with one another in a tranquil dance in the center, and a more frenzied fashion toward the edges."
