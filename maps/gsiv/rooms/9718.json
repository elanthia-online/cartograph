    "The maze of trails crossing intersecting limbs of the massive oak trees grows thin, and finally impassable to the south, where smaller branches replace the wide boughs.  Breaks in the foliage reveal hemlock trees growing at a lower altitude than the oaks, as well as hints of dogwood and redbuds."
