    "The air is heavy and thick with the feel of discharged essence that has built up here.  Shelves line two walls of the room and each shelf is filled with various flasks, potions, vials, containers of many animal parts and other items that you really don't want to think about.  A table of solid sapphire rests in the center of the room, obviously meant to provide insulation for items during the process of enchanting."
