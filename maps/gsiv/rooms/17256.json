    "The walkway ends at the foot of an expansive flight of marbled steps that is ten meters wide at its base and tapers to six meters at its apex.  At either side of the steps are carved marble lions crouched on top of sculpted foundations.  Atop the steps are three arched entrances.  The ornate center entrance is flanked by the two smaller arched openings leading into the great guild complex."
