  "description": [
    "Five brilliant stars dominate the constellation that spreads across the northern skyline, the other six barely visible beyond the rippling energy of the white dome that protects the quiet basin.  Lunar rocks, smooth and worn with age, reflect the light and seem to emit a similar radiance that is soft, yet persistent in its strength.  Interrupting the gold-veined tiles of the pathway, a glowing glass-lined ring add its light to the ambiance."
