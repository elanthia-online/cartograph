  "description": [
    "The overhangs of the large buildings to both the north and south cast dark shadows across most of the ground, shrouding the numerous piles of trash and other refuse in darkness.  A rough ditch has formed in the middle of the street, and a few muddied cobblestones lie scattered along its edges."
