    "Heavy iron chains are scattered across the ground, their broken links imbedded in the dirty cobblestones of the pathway.  Whistling and howling winds cause the clouds above to race through the moonlight at a quickened pace, creating shadows that rise and fall at odd intervals throughout the area.  The sound of gravel skipping over metal fills the air."
