    "Candlelight and censer smoke come together in a heady rush at the center of the longhouse, crawling in gold-washed clouds over a raised, circular platform of raw planks bordered on all sides by seething muck.  Trailing ends of broken vines and strips of hanging bark dangle from the edges of a gaping hole in the ceiling, through which the moonlight skies beckon.  The uncertain luminescence does little to throw back the gathered shadows.",
