    "Several young elves move through the crowd, hawking the flowers they carry in large, woven baskets.  Others sit in small groups at the side of the way, playing soft tunes on tambor and flute and swaying in time with the music.  Many of the passersby glance over with suspicion or distaste as they hurry on their way.",
    "The wey is all but deserted at night.  A few wilting flower petals lie scattered on the ground, their perfume mingling with a faint hint of incense in the cool night air.  Overhead, the stars bathe the quiet city in a pale silver light and the moons look down with solemn indifference.",
    "The wey is lined with memorials, tall and short, stone and marble and bronze.  Each is marked with a different crest, some worn almost to the point of illegibility.  They crowd up against the cobblestones, forming walls of history and memory.  Amongst the commemorations, lit candles are scattered.",
