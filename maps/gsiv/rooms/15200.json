    "A blue watered silk tapestry hangs on one of the mahogany paneled walls, and a vaulted ceiling rises overhead.  A dusky blue cotton rug sits in one corner of a glossy mahogany floor.  There is a hammered copper hanging rack on one side of the shop and a vine-carved mahogany table on the other."
