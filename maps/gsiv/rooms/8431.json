    "Thick underbrush and fallen oak leaves waist-high to a halfling obscure any remnants of a trail here.  Acorns crunch underfoot with every step, the sound echoing off of the trees in an otherwise quiet forest.  The magnificent oak trees of the forest are unmoving in the calm air, steadfast as they have stood through their many years."
