  "description": [
    "Dimly illuminated by shielded lanterns, the barracks are tidy and quiet.  Several cots, some occupied and others not, are arranged in the center of the room, while footlockers are lined against the outer walls.  Warm air radiates off of the smooth wall that the barracks share with the common room and several denizens have taken to hanging their clothing against its warmth while they slumber."
