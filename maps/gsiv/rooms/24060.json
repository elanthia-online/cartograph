  "description": [
    "A small flagstone courtyard sits among the flowers, statues occupying each corner.  With each stir of the air, the scent of lavender and sage from the surrounding flower beds fills the garden, and along the side of the house stands a row of blueberry bushes.  In the center of the courtyard sits a sapphire blue, ceramic receptacle and a long, wrought iron bench with silver inlay.  A square pedestal beside the receptacle bears a large copper plaque, and a garden path leads back to the lane."
