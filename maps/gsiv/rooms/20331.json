    "The wood plank flooring has rotten through in several places, leaving large holes in the surface and making walking here treacherous.  A dilapidated porch swing hangs from the listing tin roof that is so laden with rusty holes that it does not protect from the elements at all.  The paint on the railing has peeled almost completely, leaving the bare wood showing from beneath.  A layer of mold and grime coats every surface, including a trio of steps that leads down, and the frame of the open doorway that offers entrance.",
