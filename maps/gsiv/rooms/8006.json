    "This room has the look of an office or workroom, probably because there's been an attempt to smooth the walls and floors into level surfaces.  Some decorative touches set this room apart from the others, including ragged hangings, now a faded blue-violet, which adorn the walls.  In the center of the room a massive slab of smooth iron has been set across some limestone outcroppings, forming a crude desk."
