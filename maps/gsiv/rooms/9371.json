    "Two old stone walls stand in mute silence at right angles to one another.  Both are blackened and broken.  A few yellow wildflowers grow from the corner of what may have once been a window in one of the walls. To either side of them are old broken beams and scattered piles of stone.  The building that once may have stood here was larger than the others, but little remains.  A rocky path leads north over a small hill."
