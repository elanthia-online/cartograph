  "description": [
    "The stair passes over a yawning abyss, its floor occasionally obscured by low-flying wisps of cloud.  At the steps' conclusion stands an imposing arched door, offering entrance into a towering edifice with walls rising in ivory colored grace to a cantilevered roofline high overhead.  On the handrail, a small sign is mounted, announcing this to be The Aerie, a famous theater owned and maintained by the local Bardic Guild."
