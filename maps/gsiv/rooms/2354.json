    "This chamber is a contradiction at its very core.  It is called dark, and yet the room is bathed in golden light.  A multitude of candles burn in sconces around the chamber, their incandescence augmented by the flickering of fireflies held within a splendid crystal globe hanging from the ceiling.  The walls are vibrant with color where frescos are painted in a marvelous panorama of line and color.  And yet, despite all the trappings and luminous illumination, the chamber is as cold as a tomb.",
    "A golden column of flame reaches up from a centrally placed obsidian altar.  The twisting fire casts the only light in the dark space, causing the shadows to continuously shift and change.  The chamber is round, the charcoal and ebon-washed walls rising to a domed ceiling studded with hundreds of tiny black diamonds that flash in the ambient light.  Rising from the black marble floor is a flame mosaic that runs the perimeter of the room."
