    "The shadow of a nearby stilted warehouse imparts a gentle shade from the pale light of the moons above.  The sea beneath is a canvas of sparkling blackness, while further to the west an even larger warehouse reaches toward the star-dotted sky.  A few large ships are moored alongside the docks, their sails furled and their forms still save for the rocking of the waves."
