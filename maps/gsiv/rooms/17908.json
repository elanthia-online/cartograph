  "description": [
    "A portion of the ceiling has been replaced by thick sheets of clear glaes that allow a glimpse into the surrounding rock laden with raw rubies.  The bright illumination provided by giant, glowing toadstools highlights the deep, sanguine hue of the gemstones.  Beyond a simple, polished granite archway is a dark stairway leading to the floor above."
