    "Underfoot, the grass is damp and the dirt is moist and squishy.  Every movement leaves a brief impression in the earth.  A large, oddly shaped rock seems out of place amongst the wildflowers and lush green of the grassy foothills.  The rock is the size of a small mammal and has all sorts of jagged edges and bulbous extensions."
