  "description": [
    "Thick reeds hug the shore, blurring the line between liquid and solid.  A wing, not fully stripped of its tan spotted feathers, floats half in and half out of the shallow dark water.  A collection of owl pellets nearby displays its collection of tiny desiccated bones poking out of the disintegrating scat.  A white-washed, flat-bottomed barge has run aground, mired helplessly just a few feet from shore."
