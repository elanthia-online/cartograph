  "description": [
    "At the trail's end, a stream gurgles beneath a sheath of ice adding an undercurrent of melody to the song of birds in the pines.   The water breaks the frozen coating in places, those spots marked by a silvery spray as the current leaps over and around submerged rocks.  Pines stand on either side of the confluence, as if guarding it as it meanders away toward the edge of the bluff."
