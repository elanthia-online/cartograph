    "The flat hilltop extends to the northwest.  Down the hillside, to the north and northeast, a small creek runs through an inviting stand of maple and elm trees.  Further east, a grey rock plateau rises straight up several hundred feet, its top appearing perfectly flat from this vantage point.  A short series of switchbacks steeply climbs the side of the plateau, and the plateau looks to be even more barren than the hills around you."
