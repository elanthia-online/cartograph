    "Golden-hued linden paneling encloses this cozy wagon, ending just above the thickly cushioned benches which line three of the four walls.  Pairs of rectangular windows stand on either side of the wagon's entry, each shuttered and draped with plush red and white striped velveteen.  On the opposite wall, a row of carved linden pegs displays some of the clothing sold in the wagon, and the remainder of the wares are piled haphazardly in a capacious ebonwood trunk."
