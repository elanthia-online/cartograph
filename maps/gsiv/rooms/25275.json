    "Battle plans and charts are strewn across the room, competing with racks of armor and weapons.  The smell of leather, oil and sweat permeates the area.  The walls sport a series of portraits of family members at various stages of their lives, cumulating in a tremendous canvas depicting the entire clan clasping each other in rowdy affection."
