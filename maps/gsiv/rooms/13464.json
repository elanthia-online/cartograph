  "description": [
    "As the hillside gains altitude, the air is noticeably cooler, buffeted by constant breezes.  The terrain is much rockier than below in the valley, shot with stone outcrops and strewn with a carpet of pine needles.  Dwellings perch on the edge of the bluff and snuggle in between the huge boles of pine trees.  An immense white birch occupies a prime cliff-side vantage point to the north, its papery bark littering the ground around it."
