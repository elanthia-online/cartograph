    "Slabs of multihued, enruned marble line the surface areas of this sizeable octagonal room.  The fragrance of flowers and incense immediately places your spirit at ease.  Sparingly lighted, the region appears to be caught up in a never-ending dance of shadows.  Rising from the center of the room is a dominating, non-symmetrical block of carved volcanic glass, known as the Weeping Stone."
