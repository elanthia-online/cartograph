    "The convolution of the hallway results in each segment of its passage possessing the intimacy of a small chamber.  Sight to higher and lower sections is limited, blocked by the densely carved walls and the gloom.  The clouds of dust have compressed into a low-lying fog, which drifts up the corridor with a steady resolution."
