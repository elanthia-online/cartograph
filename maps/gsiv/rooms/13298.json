    "A stone tunnel leads from the main gates to the park itself, a wide slit in its top offering ample natural lighting.  To the west is a heavy ironwood door set between large glaes-paned picture windows that offer a view into a well-stocked gift shop.  To the east, a natural piece of ebonwood has been fitted into a door space marked by a silver sign."
