    "The most visually arresting feature of this room is the cabinets that line the entirety of the walls.  Beginning less than a handsbreadth from either side of the entryway, the cabinets stretch in an unbroken line around the entire perimeter of the space.  A small worktable stands in the center of the room, and a small chest is situated on the floor to one side of it, but the sheer volume of storage has left no room for visible decoration, leaving this space stark and utilitarian."
