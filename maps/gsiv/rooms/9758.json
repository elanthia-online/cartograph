    "Following the narrowing inner circumference of the great tree, the incline becomes more precarious as it gains altitude.  An unusual variety of moss has grown into thick patches on the wood of the ledge here and there, and its wiry, corkscrew foliage lends a slippery hazard to the passageway.  Overhead, the details of a large platform are coalescing out of the gloom, revealing the fact that it is a substantial garret of more than one floor, accessed only by the dizzy ascent of a suspended stairway."
