  "description": [
    "The broad sweep of the ceramic tile floor is interrupted by a mound of silk-covered pillows.  Halfway to the mosiac-tiled ceiling, a pair of cast iron sconces hangs on one of the hung silk walls.  An aqua-hued seaglass display and a tall oak and ivory cabinet are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
