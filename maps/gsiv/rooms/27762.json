    "The packed snow of the footpath ends here at a tall stone wall covered in hoarfrost.  Just in front of the wall, patches of icy, indigenous flowers are bordered by crisp-leafed teaberry and bearberry bushes.  Ice-glazed moonflowers in a rainbow of colors are clustered in round mounds of ice-frosted earth.  The occasional falling snowflake perches on a flower here and there, long enough to give a brief twinkle before fading away."
