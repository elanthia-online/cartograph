    "A potted cothinar plant rests directly below an elegant crimson silk tapestry, set on the planked maple floor opposite the room's entrance.  Some thick mithril shelves hang from the eastern wall, placed across from a burnished maple counter trimmed with dark mithril on the other side of the room.  The painted stucco ceiling is securely supported by russet wooden beams that run the length of the some cream-colored stucco walls."
