    "Swiftly flowing water passes by, the current strong enough to send up a cold mist of water droplets from the points where rocks poke their heads up above the stream's surface.  Though a bit muddy around the banks, the center of the stream flows bright and clear.  The otherwise peaceful panorama is broken by laughter-filled shouts, cheers, and mocking cries coming from upstream and down.  A narrow footpath winds along the western edge of the watercourse."
