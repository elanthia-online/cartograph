    "Nearing the front gate of the great spider shrine, you find yourself standing between its two polished basalt mandibles.  The stone spider jaws reach out from the main structure of the temple, seemingly poised to close on you and pinch you in half in one deft movement.  Paths continue eastward, winding their way through the myriad simple hut-like dwellings."
