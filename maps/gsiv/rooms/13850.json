  "description": [
    "The low ceiling of the tunnel is flecked with mithril, which glistens in the shadowy twilight of the labyrinth like precious jewels.  The Ne'halin river emerges from its own course through the mountain and runs along beside the travel path, its dark swells revealing a strong current.  Large stones break the water's rush, spaced evenly across the cataract.  Their tops are rough to provide a safe footing on the wet granite."
