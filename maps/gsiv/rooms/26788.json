    "This branch of the tunnel ends abruptly with what appears to have been a cave-in.  Shattered timbers lie amidst the other rubble and debris in a sloped heap at the southernmost point.  Dripping water can be heard splashing on the floor in several places and for a moment you feel as if you are not alone."
