    "In the center of the small room, a pair of sinuously curved ashwood armchairs is arranged on either side of a glass-topped oblong table, piled high with discarded books.  Rows of plain wooden shelves displaying elven-titled books, maps, scrolls, and parchments can be seen throughout the far corners of the room.  Adorning the walls are beautifully crafted backpacks hanging from a row of silvery-tipped pegs."
