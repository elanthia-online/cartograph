    "[Desert Evening Room]"

  "description": [
    "This room conveys the feeling of sleeping outside in the warm desert at evening, with a multicolored sunset on the walls all around, sandy brown oak flooring, and furniture made from bleached oak upholstered in sunset colors.  Small green throw rugs scattered about the floor appear as oases on the desert sands.  A few cacti grow in painted clay pots, and a bleached minotaur skull adds more ambiance to the desert scenario."
