    "Slate flagstones make a winding path through a small garden to a glaes-paned door.  Red cedar trees flank the door, while clematis vines wind their tendrils around the grey bricks of a low slate-roofed building.  In the garden itself, various dye plants grow in abundance.  A horse apple tree shelters a planting of beets, while yarrow, burdock, and coreopsis grow in rows on both sides of the path.  Along the path, perky dandelions shove themselves between staid hollyhocks."
