  "description": [
    "The octagonal room boasts the familiar double columns standing guard around its walls, crowned with elaborately adorned capitals.  In the chamber's center stands a stone font.  Its base is supported with a spiral of small, carved dragonettes cavorting in a winged torrent that sweeps up from the floor.  A thin trickle of water from the font sends soft echoes bouncing off the columns, like the sound of a solitary brook."
