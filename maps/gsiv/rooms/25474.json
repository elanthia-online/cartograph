    "Three large, open air firepits flare and crackle in a line just outside the covering of a stone roof supported by a number of heat-blackened pillars.  Metal shavings and fallen droplets lie swept into a neat pile in one corner of the clear, hard-packed dirt floor.  Several aprons hang from a long iron peg pounded into a broad wooden pole."
