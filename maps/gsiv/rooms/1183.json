    "The roar of the river grows louder, and the current makes a small bend here.  Its course changes from northwest to due west, and the waters spill out of a narrow gorge, pouring forth to create a series of swift rapids that whirl and foam around the riverbed's large boulders.  Small pieces of wood carried out of the gorge by the waters smash to splinters against the boulders, displaying the river's destructive force for all to see."
