    "Refurbished driftwood walls rise from a varnished dark oak floor.  Just above a woven Vornavian silk rug hangs a snarling war griffin painting, and a dark and light oak ceiling completes the picture.  A plain wooden table and a slender driftwood counter stand side by side in the middle of the room."
