    "Where once palatial bookcases lined the walls, rats now scurry behind blackened modwir boards.  Piled high in a corner, some torn and waterstained volumes slowly rot away from this world.  A rotting board creaks softly underfoot, and you briefly ponder the safety of these ruins before moving on."
