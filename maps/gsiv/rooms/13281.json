    "A deep blue arch forms the majority of the southwestern wall, its softly curving form accented with pale silver leaves.  Dark sapphire blue silk curtains drape across its interior, hiding anything beyond in a haze of shimmering jewel-like glints.  The sweeping, iridescent blue wings of a dark starling stretch across the top of the arch, and the beautiful painting is further enhanced by a border of dark silver."
