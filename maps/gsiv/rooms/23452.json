  "description": [
    "Planks of knotted driftwood have been carelessly nailed together, forming an uneven flooring that makes it difficult to maintain your balance.  Rusted nail heads have bled a brownish red color into the planks, giving the appearance of a long-ago battleground.  A large sail painted with obscure markings hangs on the back wall, and a variety of wares clutter the room, filling both the sturdy netting that hangs from the ceiling and the haphazardly stacked chests and trunks."
