    "The southern wall of the tower is anchored by a massive bay window that looks out onto the red-blushed golden desert beyond.  Coiled serpents of brass and copper spiral around the entablature above, their slitted emerald eyes winking in the daylight that spills through the glass-paned frame.  Carpeted in viridian velvet, the passage curves down toward the tower's lower floors."
