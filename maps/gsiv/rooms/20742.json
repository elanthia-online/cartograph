    "Vivid lace coverlets gird the muted furniture in the room, adding a touch of color to the room.  Airy, cream-hued curtains have been tied back from some windows with rose-tufted sashes.  A plush couch holds a pale green hue, and a blown-glass vase of wildflowers sits on a low table next to one of the polished knotty pine walls.  A brass-inset door leads back out to the landing."
