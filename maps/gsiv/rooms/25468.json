    "Wooden planks span the interior of the pavilion to serve as a makeshift floor, while sparse furs of varying species act as a sort of carpeting.  Racks hung along the walls stretch pieces of sinew taut to dry, and others display a variety of disembodied feathered wings stretched wide.  In the air, the faint scent of rosin lingers."
