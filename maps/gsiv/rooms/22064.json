    "Standing off to the side, a glaes mandolin sculpture rests on a wooden pedestal inlaid with thin strips of gold next to a carved mahogany desk.  A pair of velvet cushioned chairs flank a tall window curtained with layers of pale gauze.  Several potted plants are placed about the room, giving contrast to the white marble floor."
