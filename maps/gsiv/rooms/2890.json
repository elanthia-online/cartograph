  "description": [
    "The air is filled with steam, the source of which is a bubbling, spring fed lake nestled amongst snowless rocks.  The water is deep, and colored an emerald green that grows darker towards the outlet at the far end of the lake.  Spouting from the outlet is a small stream that rushes down the northern slope in a torrent.  Snowflakes melt in the air, sprinkling the effervescent lake as tiny droplets of water."
