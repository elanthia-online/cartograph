    "Dominating the center of the chamber is a circular white marble fountain.  A majestic peacock with a colorful glass fanned-tail stands atop a center stone with water trickling down the sides into a pool surrounding the base.  The pale floor is broken by darker stones that create walkways leading to a wide velvet-draped arch and a large opening.  Moonlight passes through a clear crystal dome and blankets the room in a pale light."
