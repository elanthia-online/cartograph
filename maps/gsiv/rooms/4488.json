  "description": [
    "Although tidy and neat, the workshop itself is poorly lit, with shadows creeping about in all corners of the room.  Several low tables are scattered over the hard cavern floor.  Along one wall, two large cabinets stand locked and closed, though a sign across the front of them clearly indicates that the contents are for leather-working.  The remaining walls of the workshop are strung with weathered tapestries, their scenes that of armor-clad dwarves engaged in battle."
