  "description": [
    "Glossy, rounded, ebon-hued stones, roughly the size of quail eggs, litter the beach in all directions.  A sheen of moisture across the surface makes for slippery footing, but as the slope levels out toward the shoreline, traversing the rocks becomes less treacherous.  Wind-whipped, black sand stings sharply upon any exposed skin, and the rhythmic sound of the ocean fills the air."
