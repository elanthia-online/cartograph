  "description": [
    "A slight breeze of cool air floats in through a tent flap, providing a much-needed reprieve from the warmth inside the tent.  A set of large stoves rests in the rear of the tent, radiating waves of pastry-scented heat.  A long counter sits in the center of the room, beads of condensation forming on the glass."
