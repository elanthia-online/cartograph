    "Eight crenellated points ring the crown of the tower and are set with archaic devices that pulse in an odd, hypnotic pattern of green and purple lights.  Dropping from the landing, the banister-wrapped stairs disappear around a curve in the tower's walls and are illuminated by orbs of light.  Resting in the shadows of the crown is a small building with copper and silver flashing."
