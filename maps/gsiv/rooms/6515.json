    "The derelict thoroughfare emerges from the thickets and trees, offering an engaging, moonlit panorama of the surroundings.  To the north lies a lake, with dense banks of fog drifting across its surface like clouds against a gray sky.  The road meanders away to the east, where it finally crosses a grassy plain.  Barely visible on the lake's eastern shores, a fortress with crenellations rises up out of the mist.  A thick forest stands impassively to the southwest.",
