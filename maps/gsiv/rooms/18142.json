    "Hanging from a vaalin chain, a beautiful crystal lamp sways above, the cut glass of the panes send motes of fragmented light across the alabaster stone.  Set into the wall opposite a white marble pedestal is an ivory silk-draped archway.  Centered in the hall floor is a beautiful mosaic crafted from tiny crystals."
