  "description": [
    "This side of the building is bathed in vertigris shadow.  Positioned within the niche is a grey marble figure of a young woman reclining against the bole of a tree.  Her form is supple and her features possess a divine grace as fierce as it is sublime.  Occasional reflections of light from the building's walls play across the statue, making it almost seem to breathe."
