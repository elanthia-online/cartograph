    "The broad sweep of the oak floor is interrupted by a scaled model of Hearthstone.  Halfway to the golden oak ceiling, a midnight blue rising phoenix tapestry hangs on one of the plain wooden walls.  A bamboo rack and a flexible willow woven basket are pushed close together in the back of the shop."
