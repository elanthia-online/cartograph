    "This part of the pier shows a good deal more deterioration than the drier, landward parts.  Decades of pounding surf have taken their toll and marine worms and mollusks have eaten away at the pilings, weakening them gravely.  An occasional burst of spume from the larger waves catches you by surprise as you look through gaps in the decking to watch the waves break beneath you."
