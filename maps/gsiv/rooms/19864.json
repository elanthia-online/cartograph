    "Glassless windows stand upon the outside world, the rolling greenery pockmarked with arbors laden with grapevines.  Set upon a cream-hued limestone workbench, a polished bronze crucible rests in circles of moonlight, while a blown glass alembic has been moved into the shadows of the nearby wall.  A dark steel gem lens assembly has been placed along the northern wall so that it can take full advantage of the silvery light that floods in through the surrounding windows."
