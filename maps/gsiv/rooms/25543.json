    "Breaking around the shore of a broad forested island, two branches of the Mistydeep converge to resume their joint ramble southeastward.  Casting a long shadow across the water is a multi-turreted tower that reaches skyward.  The dusky granite, of which the tower is constructed, is so cunningly crafted that some portions appear carved from a natural rock formation.  Numerous narrow windows gape uncovered, revealing only darkness within.  Skirting the building, a tangled thicket keeps outsiders at bay."
