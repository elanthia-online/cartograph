  "description": [
    "Sectioned off by a thick curtain of canvas, now tied back to let in light and air, the small sleeping quarters are compact yet comfortable.  A large windowed opening cut into the cloth flaps softly with the breeze, and the sound of chirping crickets is clearly audible.  Books are piled up near the pillow-side of the mattressed cot, a single oil lamp balanced on the top with a small box of matches placed nearby."
