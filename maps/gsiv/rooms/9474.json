    "Adding to the cacophony and overall state of disarray in this cluttered little cave is the noise of the nearby forge.  Several tallow candles placed on mismatched sconces along the walls do little to penetrate the soot and smoke lingering heavily inside the shop.  Shields and armor of all sizes and shapes hang from hooks carved from the rough stone walls."
