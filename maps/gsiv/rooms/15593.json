    "The passage comes to an abrupt halt where a series of submerged boulders form a wall of solid, impassable stone.  A small niche lies to the north, where the damp soil between two chunks of granite was carved out by thick, persistent claws.  Overhead tree roots, stripped bare of protective dirt, rot in the damp fetid climate of the tunnels."
