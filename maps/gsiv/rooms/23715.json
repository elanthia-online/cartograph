  "description": [
    "Massive in height and size, large gear assemblies and ropes are tethered off throughout the hangar.  A series of tall iron beams curves into a framework shaped like an open ribcage.  Several stacks of wood, fabrics, and assorted metals are piled up all around the hangar.  A long wooden beam and two barrels form a makeshift workbench, with a wooden bench and a slightly torn divan facing it."
