    "Three steps lead up to the platform of a raised dais, where a massive rectangular-shaped oak table rests.  Intricately carved chairs covered in blue velvet surround the table.  Serving as a centerpiece, a crystal bowl is filled with exotic and local fruit.  Mouthwatering aromas of roasting meat and baking bread drift in from the nearby kitchen."
