    "Perched at the edge of a towering aspen glade, a blue and purple pavilion holds court in the snow-covered alpine grass.  Lilac alpine asters bloom amid the heavy iron support spikes that bind the structure's walls close to the ground, their pale heads nodding in the heat that permeates the canvas walls.  Glaesine globes glint in the sunlight from their home within the upper branches of the flame-leafed trees that stand nearby."
