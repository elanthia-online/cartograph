    "Dark woods and muted, cool hues predominate in this spacious bedroom.  Aside from the central four-poster bed facing a blue-grey riverstone fireplace, a full-length mirror, and a matching wash basin, the room is bare of other furniture.  Gracing the foot of the bed is a woven soft grey throw, and a plush carpet in shades of charcoal and antique gold adds notes of luxury in the otherwise austere chamber.  Pale moonlight filters through the sheer curtains that cover the only window, shadowed boughs of the large banyan tree creating swaying patterns."
