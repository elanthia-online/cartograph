    "The wood used for the planks and the buildings in this section of town have been covered with a green fungus.  At the waterline, where the wood is still wet, the structures are a bright green.  Closer to the top of the structures the fungus has died and turned black.  The coloring here gives the area the illusion of being painted green and black by a group of halfling and giantman painters where the halflings had only green paint, and the giantmen had only black.",
    "The planks that make up the walkway are completely supported by barrels at this point.  The boardwalk is flanked by rows of ramshackle sheds and houses, all of them also supported by massive rafts of barrels.  The whole town creaks and sways in the waters of the marsh.  A stretch of newer planking joins the walkway to a high-fenced platform to the northeast.",
    "The wood used for the planks and the buildings in this section of town have been covered with a grey fungus.  At the waterline, where the wood is still wet, the structures are a dark grey.  Closer to the top of the structures the fungus has died and turned black.  The coloring here gives the area the illusion of being painted grey and black by a group of halfling and giantman painters where the halflings had only grey paint, and the giantmen had only black."
