    "Columns of aged limestone sparkle in the sunlight, while window between them provide views of the many grape arbors between the wings of the guild.  Tiles painted with feathers and crescent moons alternate with those of natural limestone on the floor, providing small rings of decoration around a pair of marble-framed alcoves.  Two small marble benches, each set on either side of a door, are topped with wide pillows that provide a quiet place for meditation."
