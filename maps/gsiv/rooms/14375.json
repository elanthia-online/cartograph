  "description": [
    "The waterfall sends a spray of mist across the clearing at its base each time the breeze gusts.  A bluff of granite cuts off the trail on the north, its pitted surface rich with moss and ferns growing in crevices.  Cabins are tucked in a semi-circle beneath a grove of pecan trees to the west.  The lake stretches away to the east, a mirror to catch the reflection of the rising sun each morning."
