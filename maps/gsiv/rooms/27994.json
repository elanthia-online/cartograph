    "Blue and grey shale slabs form a low wall to the south that is riddled with a blanket of green alpine moss, the dark mounds giving the ancient structure a mottled appearance.  Zebra-stripped aspen trees stretch their spindled limbs to the sky, their branches laden with flame-hued leaves that are shaped like spear heads.  Positioned to the northwest to the converging trails, a hunter green geteld with bright white embroidery along its edges sits in a bed of wooly ice blue moss."
