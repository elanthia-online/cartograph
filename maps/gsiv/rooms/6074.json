    "The wheat field has a sea-like appearance.",
    "The wheat field has a sea-like appearance.  Almost all the wheat stalks are the same length, presenting their kernels at nearly the same height to give a smooth, level look to the surrounding wheat.  As the wind blows, the stalks ripple.  Since the air moves in small gusts, though, the rippling is not all over the field all at once, but proceeds in waves from one end to the other, much like swells move across a large body of water."
