    "The thin carpeting is mostly covered with a plush bearskin rug.  A few small skins cover the otherwise bare wooden walls.  The rock barrier of the mountainside is the only thing visible out of the window.  A stout dwarf works diligently behind the counter, measuring and cutting skins of all kinds."
