    "Placed strategically under a leafy arbor for shade, a vine-carved bench hides in the darkness.  Interrupting the natural beauty of a grassy knoll sprinkled with a scattering of buttercups is a lattice-worked gazebo.  A slate-paved walkway that snakes through flowering bushes and trees leads toward the steps of the structure.  Gorgeous bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and pink encircle the base of a pedestal upon which a magnificent gold statue of an elven man is perched."
