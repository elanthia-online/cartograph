  "description": [
    "A row of empty, verdigris torch brackets line the north and south walls, each trailing a stain of green almost to the floor.  Filling the western end of the hall from floor to ceiling is a collapsed archway that may have once resembled the mouth of an immense viper, with paired fangs rising from the floor.  The broken-off stubs of a second pair of fangs protrude from the upper jaw just ahead of two empty eyesockets."
