    "Brilliantly glowing lanterns of brass and glass sway frenetically as the fierce nighttime winds whip across the exposed far end of the pier, where a three-masted sailing vessel tugs against its secure mooring lines.  Despite the occasional deluge of salty spray, the surface feels sturdy and safe with a coarse coating of black coral dust giving purchase to the footing.  Beyond the railing, a dark and restless sea stretches outward, melding at the horizon with a star-encrusted skyline.",

Beyond the railing, the white-capped sea reaches out to touch the horizon in all directions."
