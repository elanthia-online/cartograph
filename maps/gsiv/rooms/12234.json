    "Towering white stone walls rise up all around in a large circle.  The floor is slick with near-freezing water, and blocks of ice, as tall as trees, stand like statues nearby.  An immense spoon-shaped shadow looms overhead, never drawing nearer.",
    "Curved black iron walls rise up all around in a very large circle.  The metal floor glistens with oil and grows increasingly hotter as time passes.  An immense forked shadow looms overhead, never drawing nearer."
