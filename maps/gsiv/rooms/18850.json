  "description": [
    "The west end of the great hall opens up into a bright, airy parlor.  As you step into the room, your eyes are immediately drawn to an ancient elven harp set up on a small dais.  A plush snowcat rug covers the floor in front of a white marble fireplace, and white cushions made of the softest Arachnian silk lie scattered about the room, inviting you to relax and enjoy yourself.  A spiral staircase in one corner leads both upstairs and downstairs."
