    "A suffocating stench, like the foul gasses released from especially deep and ancient bogs, rises from a wide circular well in a blighted clearing some forty feet beneath the vine bridge.  The cracked and broken stone of the well's wall has been overrun by a thick, viscous fluid which seeps from the interior of the well, spreading across the clearing like a malignant ink stain.  Rotting trunks and withered vegetation border the edges of the diseased pool.",
