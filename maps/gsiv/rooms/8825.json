    "Elegant candelabra laden with fat beeswax candles softly illuminate this charming shop and the pleasant, smiling features of its proprietor.  A highly-polished floor of rich-hued maoral complements and enhances Rhynnde's impressive collection of thick woolen rugs and elegant mats, their deep colors and varied textures inviting customers to linger deliciously over the extensive selection."
