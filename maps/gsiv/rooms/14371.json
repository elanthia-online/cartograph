    "Crushed white seashells create a slender track through the garden from the kitchen door to the back wall, where a large teaberry bush blooms.  Green and red planters filled with monkeyflowers surround purple crocus plants potted in lapis-hued planters.  Opposite the potted selection is a lower garden filled with plump beets, vines of purple eggplant, and rows of star-shaped nightshade wrapped in a vibrant border of yellow gorse."
