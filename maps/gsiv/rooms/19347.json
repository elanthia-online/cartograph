    "White picket fences, their thick and thin slats entangled with vines laden with niveous violet-striped clematis and red-throated saffron hibiscus, encircle the yards of the houses that line the cobbled street.  Shell-lined pathways wind their way through the verdant lawns that the fences encircle and allow easy passage from the street to the cottages beyond, some of which have signs proclaiming them to be shops.  Lamps, their glass windows glinting in the sunlight, dangle from wrought iron shepherd's crooks that line the streets.",
