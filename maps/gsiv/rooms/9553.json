    "Giant luminescent toadstools planted in neat rows along the perimeter cast a soft, bluish-white light upon the small courtyard.  A wide, limestone and slate walkway encircles an ametrine geode fountain midway between the dark mithril arch leading to the main tunnel and a domed white granite building with heavy marble doors.  The faint aroma of loam and brine lingers in the air."
