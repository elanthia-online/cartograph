    "A tight curve of the river at this point has created a wide sandy spit.  Pieces of driftwood, a few large logs, and other forest debris are scattered across the edge of the area as the river regurgitates its contents onto the sand.  Nothing of any value seems to be present among the collection of wood, though.  No trees have been able to take root, and the moons shine down brightly on the sand, illuminating the spit and making it easy to see.",
