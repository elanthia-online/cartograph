  "description": [
    "The nave has a traditional layout, with its central walk proceeding toward a raised dais at the far end, but in lieu of seating, piles of silk cushions and soft, colorful cloth are everywhere.  Blankets and cushions alike are wrinkled and stained.  They occupy most of the floor before a bronze statue of a buxom, tentacled woman."
