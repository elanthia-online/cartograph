  "description": [
    "Several long, rough-hewn wooden tables are crowded together, surrounded by equally basic benches.  Simple, iron-chained chandeliers hang suspended from the high, domed ceiling, each set with thick beeswax tapers.  The floor and walls are unfinished tufa, though care has been taken on one wall to incorporate the undulations of several natural veins of glimaerstone into a larger fresco.  A stone grinding wheel and oaken press sit beneath the painting."
