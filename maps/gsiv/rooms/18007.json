    "A salmon-colored awning covers the center of the courtyard.  The moonlight filtered through the awning casts everybody in a strange orangish light.  A simple monir table serves the Training Administrator as a desk.  From here the Administrator keeps a calm, disinterested eye on the activities in the courtyard and the portico."
