    "Silken braided cords bearing the weight of tapestries depicting teasingly amorous scenes are dispersed among built-in wall hooks that display pious sigils and garments.  A solitary yellow-edged red banner hangs overhead, and a lone altar in the center of the room is decorated with yellow and red candlesticks wreathed in rings of golden smoke that drift lazily outward from several gold censers."
