    "The walls and ceiling are paneled in dark cherry wood, which makes the room seem smaller than it really is.  Low-backed chairs upholstered with red leather seats are arranged beside a glowing brazier.  The sounds of clinking mugs and low voices provide the comforting sense that refreshments are near."
