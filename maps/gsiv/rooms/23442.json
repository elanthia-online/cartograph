    "Rough wooden boards march across the floor, warped in several places and coated in a thin layer of brine.  Wide tapestries line the walls, dappled with shadows from the moonlight seeping through a dirty porthole.  A pair of wooden mannequins, one short and one tall, stands opposite a pair of swinging doors.  The air is heavy with the scent of salt."
