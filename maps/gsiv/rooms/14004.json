    "Constructed entirely in the round, the walls of this room are covered in deep blue watered silk.  The ceiling overhead is draped with sheer silver gossamer, and from the center of the swathes hangs a pale blue mithglin chandelier.  Large velvet pillows in shades of white, blue, silver, and grey have been scattered about the cozy space, providing a comfortable place to rest."
