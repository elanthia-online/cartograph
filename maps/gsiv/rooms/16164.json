    "Numerous steps, cut into the dirt floor, lower the room significantly in contrast to the courtyard outside.  A coolness pervades the room, the source of which is a gurgling flow of water from a bamboo pipe into a retaining pool, offering an accessible source of fresh water inside the walls of the outpost.  Large casks that line the room are filled with fruits and vegetables, while large chunks of cured meat hang from metal hooks attached to the ceiling."
