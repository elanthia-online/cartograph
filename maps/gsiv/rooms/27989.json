    "Far smaller than the other rooms in this replicated barn, this stall is only large enough to house a pony.  A line of iron hooks along the panelled sides hold a variety of kits for proper storage of the horse owner's grooming tools.  A pair of large silver horseshoes tacked to the wall hold commemorative kits for this gala event.  A twine-tied bale of hay provides a resting spot for perusing the available goods."
