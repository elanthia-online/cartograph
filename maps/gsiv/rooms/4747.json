    "The hollow interior of the great oak expands outward into a roughly circular hall.  The brittle grey wood of the walls and ceiling, once living matter, has splintered and collapsed in upon itself, leaving yawning openings in the chamber.  Dead leaves and wood splinters cover the floor, and the remnants of a long banquet table lie half-buried beneath the debris.  Scattered fragments of colored crystal, perhaps from shattered goblets, glint in the dim light.",
