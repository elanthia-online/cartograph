    "A blackened fireplace dominates the center of one wall, its surface charred and covered in cobwebs.  Stained animal skins lie before the hearth, flanked on either side by bone-inlaid couches.  Grisly, misshapen trophies, consisting of the heads of elves, humans, dwarfs and halflings line the discolored walls."
