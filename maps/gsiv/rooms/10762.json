    "The road rises slightly to the northeast and declines to the south, following the landscape in a slow, lazy arc.  A stream runs along a few yards to the west, paralleling the roadbed and darting around the old, stately pines that drink from its coursing waters.  Here and there a large conifer interrupts the flow, creating a small pool upon which water striders dart about in search of food before they themselves become food for larger, more carnivorous insects."
