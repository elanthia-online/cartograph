  "description": [
    "Round stone pavers wind their way between lush sections of fertile earth decorated with aged brass placards describing the herbs grown in each.  Eaves made of thick timbers shelter a heavy spruce door in the abbey's facade, conspicuously coated with resin at the sides to create a better seal when it is closed.  At the far end of the garden, along the cliff's edge, a loud droning emanates from a large apiary swarming with countless bees."
