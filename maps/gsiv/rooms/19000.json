    "Tidy rows of well-kept tomes line the orderly series of stone shelves that tower overhead.  Cushioning the footfalls of perusing sorcerers are plush, vermilion runners that line the wide paths between the stacks.  Numerous chocolate brown armchairs have been arranged in cozy circles around glaes-topped tables lit by miniature luminescent toadstools."
