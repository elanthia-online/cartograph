    "This asymmetrical alcove slants downward as it deepens, with the furthest edge of the ceiling cracked and sheared off by massive slabs of stone that have lanced through the earth as if dislodged at some point by a tremendous quake.  The effect is a staggered wall of stony plates, their uneven lengths creating windows into the open cavern that lies beyond.  Icily chilled gusts whistle through the cracks and up through a heavily warded doorway that leads to a downward set of steps, lending an almost frosty quality to the air."
