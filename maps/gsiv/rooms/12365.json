    "The triangular sweep of shrouds, laddered with ratlines, tapers from their base beyond the fo'csle bulwark, past the fore yard to end at the fore topcastle above.  Angled from the chain wales outboard along the hull to the formast above, the tilt of the shrouds, and the ratlines, make this a secure perch above the fo'csle deck.  From here you can climb down the shrouds to the fo'csle deck, or climb up the rigging to the topcastle."
