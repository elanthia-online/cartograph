    "A roaring blaze crackles and snaps in a large stone fireplace, warming the large open room nicely.  An overstuffed horsehair settee and a few chairs provide a place to rest and socialize.  The curtain covering the entrance to the pantry holds in the heat, while opposite the hearth, a tall hoarbeam door leads outside."
