  "description": [
    "Turbulence heaves the water into a nightmarish beast, smashing against the rough rock walls of the dark tunnel and then rolling over itself in a roaring fury.  Vague light ventures in at either end of the confining passageway, but quickly fades as if in deference to the currents' delirious momentum.",
    "The roar of water crashing against the rock walls of the tunnel is deafening, its voice a low rumble that penetrates the rock where the water, for all its fury and force, cannot reach.  At each end of the watery maelstrom, low light filters in.  However, the violent cascade filling the passageway obscures what little illumination can be seen.",
    "The currents careen through the hollow rock in a rampage.  It's impossible to tell if they follow a specific course, or merely churn and rage through the tunnel in an unending assault against the confining walls.  Light is barely visible at each end of the subterranean passage, however, a strange phosphorescence outshines it, glowing from the rock walls with an unearthly emerald light."
