    "Book-filled dark rich mahogany bookshelves line the walls from floor to ceiling of this enormous chamber.  Centered along the inner wall is a grey-swirled white marble fireplace, while two golden padded couches flank the hearth and a third emerald couch directly faces the fire.  Several gold chandeliers arch out from gracefully curved wall mounts at even intervals throughout the room."
